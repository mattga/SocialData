RUBIO, you piece of fucking CUBAN TRAITOR SHIT, in 18531856, ENGLISH AND FRENCH imperialists went to the aid of OTTOMAN empire to defeat RUSSIA. As a result they prolonged the life this INHUMAN empire up to 1918. And these FUCKING TURKS then paid their Christian masters back by KILLING 1 Million Christian ARMENIANS. Now you CUNT want to go help them again in their act of GENOCIDE of SYRIANS, KURDS AND YAZIDIES. You fucking American CUNT, CUNT, CUNT, CUNT, CUNT, CUNT, CUNT, CUNT. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

For her to ask What do they these protesters want? as if to insist they had no reason to be there speaking out is disgusting. If you had a son and a police shot him unjustly and it took a whole year for them to do anything about it... Im sure youd want people to speak out. You wonder why minorities think many on fox are racist...Im not sure why you think that when your bias is so very clear. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
poor tie choice Rubio, and terrible knot. You are still the man Rubio, just let me become you professional tie tier <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz is a true conservative, Marco Rubio now has become the puppet of the Republican machinery or as Ted Cruz calls it, the Washington Cartel. We are sick of the establishment candidates, they are DemocRATS disguised as Republicans!!! TED CRUZ 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz, Trump, Carson, Rubio, anything but the lying criminal cunt Hillary or Santa Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fuck Fox news too. Theyre nothing but a mouthpiece for the RNC establishment and no better than CNBC, MSNBC or any other Lame Stream Media you care to mention. I wanna puke every time Rubio speaks! TRUMP 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bad news for Dana Bush supporter working for Fox, conflict of interest. All the money Bush has and all the rationale she thinks she has in her little brain wont be able to save Bush or kasich or Rubio the sneaky snake. When you try to be critical, be fair in your application of reason. That way you wont come off sounding like a failed saleswoman Carly?. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio will win 2016. People will hate on him, but in the end he is the most qualified candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
as a democrate best case scenario is trump or carson wins the primary. The worst case scenario is Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Putito Rubio es un asco. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb and Rubio have both favored amnesty, which would merely invite MORE illegals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im an Irish American from NYC, a life long union man, ND Im an ex con. You just dont get anymore liberal Democrat than me OR the people around me. I am voting for fellow New Yorker Donald Trump. I never left the Democrats, they have left me. They have been hijacked by communists, rabidly anti white black supremisists, extreme feminists, radical homosexuals and some real shady people from the international banking cartels. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is the Hillary Clinton of the GOP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a liberal.. Yes we want him to win... Hes your problem Republicans Party. Lol Deal with it. And stop fucking crying about the Media... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
U surely will not go to war Rubio. U will be in some underground shelter when nuclear bombs starts flying around. Innocent people will pay the price for recklessness and craziness of DC establishment <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is why Rubio will not be president and is why he is sinking in the polls. Defending Turkey is like Defending Germany in WW2. They are playing on both sides and if he becomes elected Im moving to Russia and Ill have a cup of tea with Snowden <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The US shouldnt defend any of these sand rats from the pigs arse of allah. They cheered the murders in Paris. Rubio should move to turkey and defend them himself. The Europeans dont even want the turk scumbags in the EU. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So any NATO state can behave bad and the US still has to support it? Wow, n wonder this world is so mess up. Rubio is a sociopath who will murder the planet by supporting terrorists. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Marco Rubio thinks every country in the world will do what he says because he says so. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a SNAKE. Hes already become accustomed to the bacon wrapped shrimp, K Street crowd. Rubio is for illegal alien amnesty. Rubio cannot be trusted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please Ted Cruz is is a rehearsed, silver spoon fake and career politician. What has he done but pound his chest like the rest of the politicians? He crumbles under Washington pressure. He accepts refugees and has done nothing to stop illegal migration. No thanks! Ben Carson is a authentic Christian and has actually lived a life of integrity. God bless Dr. Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats another reason not to vote for Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RUBIO. is saying basically what they tried to do in IRAQ, god damn it , do u not understand that you need BOTH shia and sunni as one army to fight the common goal of terrorism... you cant just have SUNNIS, thats just stupid and will create more instability, did u not learn from iraq? or are you just that out of touch on the facts??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio is toast. Does anyone get what is going on? We need Trump more than ever! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not a supporter.... but Rubio sounds like a solid candidate Has knowledge. Smart. Young has passion.... Why isnt he on top? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
basically we are going to defend Turkey so they keep buying oil to isis, financing them. while we,U.S., will look like good guys just helping our ally....wow,that is disgusting rubio! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And how would you intend on preventing Russia from destroying ISIS Mr. Rubio? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubio should be eliminated <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Genious ! Video should be titled Rubio plans for WW3. Defend Turkeys right to attack Russia even if the result is the annihilation of all humanity... Rubio Republican rhetoric. When you declare war on Russia your ass better be on the front lines you worthless windbag. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, Rubio just lost the nomination. Yes, lets start WW3. What a moron. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats why Rubio will not be President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a LOSER. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Turkey is the home base for ISIS and the main buyer of ISIS oil. Rubio backs ISIS. Look at the smirk on his face when he hears the news about the Russian jet being shot down. The NATO Forces are in bed with ISIS. Wake the hell up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubio is an idiot <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio sucks Saudi dicks! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

this bastard wana defende turkey against russia only cause he is a neocon russian hater when turkey buy oil to isis and finance all terrorist this bastard son of a bitch rubio wana go to 3ww you rape your mother <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Turks do something stupid, and the U.S. backs them up. Screw them. Screw Rubio. Screw the Middle East. Bring all the boys back home. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck you Rubio. Turkey shot down that plane and are directly funding ISIS, TURKISH businessman buying oil from ISIS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
@Marco Rubio you cant support Turkey if you are pro Israel. Turkey hates Israel! If you support Israel you should hate Turkey!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
17 thumbs down, 0 thumbs up. Rubio supports Allah Akbar. Garbage <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Really Rubio? Wow I cant believe this is actually someone running for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Turkey would no longer be a member of NATO after their acts against Russia which is trying to destroy ISIS,And what little respect I had for Rubio is now gone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Question for trump supporters genuine question, not a gotcha question Should trump decide to run against the republican party as an independent, would he still have your support? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i actually agree with rubio about who we are not at war with, and that the radical murders must be destroyed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In the RCP average Rubio wins Hillary in all swing states. Trump and Cruz lose all of them. Good luck GOP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When Marco Rubio speaks, its so Rehearsed and fake. What an empty suit of a politician he is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When OReilly is the voice of reason you know things are fucked up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
he from that Old group of republicans wich have Bush, Gringrinch, McCain etc, but now we have guys like Rubio, Cruz, Carson, Paul, Christie, guys that are even get the young people, well republicans are comming and they will get every single chair of power in this country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio goes all the way!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The real question is will Trump get the nomination at the republican convention? I want to see the reaction of Trump supporters when Rubio gets nominated....lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is Absolutely RIGHT <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio Fiorina ticket!!! Damn, thatd be awesome, a hispanic and a woman, groups that destroy the lefts identity politics, PC rhetoric, and stigmatization. The GOP could beat Hilary twice with that ticket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio 2016. Even the NY times said Rubio scares Dems! Hes the only candidate that can surely defeat Hillary in the general as far as Im concerned. Hes articulate, hes smart, with an inspiring story, and young with fresh ideas. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Pretty obvious Rubio is an establishment puppet by and the amount of time he gets on fox. F Obama, F the NWO, F fake republicans, F the police, F drone pilots who fly over America, F fox. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good thing Rubio still loses against Bernie Sanders nation wide, which is ignored by FOX... I wonder why that is? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
See what you have done Fox News? You keep pushing false numbers on Rubio beating Clinton and they come here to cuddle and giggle about it, then attack Republicans. BTW I enjoyed your segment Gretchen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would conjecture that the polls show Rubio looking good against Hillary because some of the females or gay, MSM males who might otherwise vote for Hillary think Rubio is cute remember Palin? Kennedy? Melania? Looks matter... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id take Florina over Rubio, but neither over #Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump couldnt handle debate moderators yet he expects us to believe he can handle ISIS?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has been saying since the beginning of his presidential announcement. And Carl Icahn made a whole 150M superpac himself preaching and warning about companies leaving overseas. Corporate Inversion. Fox business folks are the worst Rubio suckups. Disgusting. WSJ, Fox Business, and GOP estabullies for that matter will pay for their bias reporting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubios establishment advisers provided him with a good plan for a presentation to the public. But it still remains, that Rubio is too weak to protect Americans from our own government, including special interests and other government influence. He will quickly collapse when defending the American public while in office. We have one chance to eliminate corruption and bring power to the people. TRUMP 2016... the man with the leverage and courage to Make America Great Again! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stupid republicans went back to sleep after 911 and didnt do a dammed thing about Osama Bin Laden. Now they want to take credit for what they didnt do. Neither Donald Trump nor Marco Rubio and Shithead Ted Cruz, who is not even a native american have had the balls the put on the uniform and fight for this country like thousands of latinos have. In fact one of the first casualties during the stupid Bush Iraq war was a young marine from Guatemala. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz and Rubio are half rooted Americans now is not the time for another half rooted president like Obama. we need some one that will standup and take control of the govt. and turn America around!!...... Trump 2016!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the candidate, Fox News keeps trying to drive down Carson and prop up establishment garbage like Jeb and Rubio. #BenCarson #election <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson has said SO many things that fly past the edge of reality that anyone with half a brain can see hes a fullon, flatout nut job. I dont agree with Lindsay Graham on policy but hes given me no reason to believe hes INSANE. Same with Bush, Kasich, Rubio, or Christie. Cruz is another head case. Whats so wrong with this country that perhaps millions of people either cant see that Carson has fully slipped his mooring or are fine with a lunatic in the White House? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio blew it on his ISIS plan. Assad is not going anywhere. Putin and France will destroy ISIS. Ignore Rubio and his nonsense! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubio...lol...only fox and GOP establishment push rubio...like romney, he looses a lot of conservatives and will loose the election. We need a strong conservative leader that leads and defends the nation, unlike rubio that aligns with obama to bring illegals in by the millios <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a onetrick pony. He can grasp foreign policy well, but hes weak and disastrous on anything else. Hed be a good advisor to the president. Rubio is no leader. The presidency is not a good fit for him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a twofaced liar. Changes his stance for votes. Arming Sunnis is a disaster. Schmuck. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio is running to get the nomination of the idiot party. This moron doesnt realize that taking out Assad will create a power vacuum, just like what happened in Iraq. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Please , Please, O , Please For My Sake ! Elect Marko Rubio ! Hes a Bigger Pussy Socialist Liar Than Obama ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Who cares ,Rubio will not be president . hes only having a moment to shine ,but in the end he will be chewed up . WATCH! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only candidate who has spoken any sense in 6 months . Trump is a salesman , Carson is short of knowledge and Cruz is a preacher . Rubio is Reps best bet to Take HC down . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Well we know fox likes Rubio, but he is much better than Kasich or Carson. But Im for TRUMP 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Congratulations Rubio! Republicans FINALLY think you can beat the lying, cheating, Hilary Clinton. Every single Republican voter should vote for a Republican candidate beating Hilary, They didnt think Rubiio could beat a criminal in the election. That is NOT good. Rubio just now gets Republican approval to beat Hilary and he becomes an INSTANT success story?? Whaaaat? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio, youre a lightweight. Get lost. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only 3 people have a shot at beating Clinton Trump, Carson and Rubio if history serves us right Americans like to chose exciting candidates not boring or bland just take a look at the people that loss the presidential race <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cmon Rubio , Russia is kicking Isis ass in Syria. They have done what the US Hasnt done over 14 months. The US GOVERNMENT wants to eliminate Bashar just for pipelines purposes the same way Hussein was eliminates because he wasnt using the Petrodollar. Who are all of you candidates trying to fool. Is a shame how fighting for our country has become a geopolitical issue and having to fight for Corporate D.C its all BS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio will be brought down by the conservatives, like Jeb Bush. TED CRUZ 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats BS Rubio. The Kurds are the ones that have fought the most and want to fight and need supply not Zuni. Itll be the same thing as b4 giving thousands if ammo and supplies and then they turn back on us. NO NO NO !!!. TRUMP 2016 !!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I thought Rubio said that he didnt pay much attention to pollsthe general tenor of his speech right now seems to tilt away from his previously voiced views. Oh how evanescent are the ideas of these politicians, all of them! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio talks a good talk but he still sounds like Obama . Rubio is a half rooted American just like Obama . I think Rubio will be just like Obama in larger govt., more debt, higher taxes and more job killing polices . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox news sucks. Trying to push Rubio. You wonder why people dont trust the media. Total propaganda bullshit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

We have all been subject to government surveillance and travel checks and restrictions because of this BS so why should certain Mosques suspected of harboring and inciting terrorists be immune to scrutiny. Trump and Rubio are right. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TrumpCruz 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Seems reasonable for murderers. RINOs in Fox appear to be numerous and corporate based. Clearly Rubio and Cruz are corporate puppets. I mean My parent was a Hispanic communist who worked hard because he loved this country. Please. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trumps lead mainly increased because more voters went from Carson to Rubio and Cruz. So ultimatly Trumps way to winnin the nomination will depend on how many that drops out. Although I think it is unlikely that any of his top 3 competitors will drop out since they all have very similar numbers so therefore it is very likely that he will win. The wildcard is that there is still around 20% to be had from the remaining candidates though. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey wheres the Republican idiot congressman to yell out you lie. Trump and Carson in the early poll leads is nothing but a rouse on the behalf of the Repuglicans. Everyone knows these two candidate are polarizing and garner all the headlines, which allow the real candidates to maneuver very quietly. You have to be some kind of idiot to vote for Carson or Trump. Again we are talking about Republicans. Cruz, Bush or Rubio and not Fat boy in little coat Christie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am not religious, but I like Carson. He is absolutely right, settle them in their part of the world.

RUBIO is just a good looking KID in a TOUGH MAN JUNGLE. GO TRUMP 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Senator Rubio gets all the right answers like this is the educational competition. We dont need a puppet politician as he is hes to polish and backed up by millionaires. We need Donald Trump. Donald Trump will bomb the shit out of them straight up. Senator Rubio I have advice for you please go home and stay in Florida <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio and Cruz are all Super Pac money so nothing will change. They will do the Super Pac bidding and the people of this country will not be represented. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It will be a toss up between Trump and Rubio at the end. Carson and Cruz are too religious, most moderate voters dont like mixing faith with policy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The incredibly stealthy establishment RINO candidate sorry Rubio, your Gang of 8 backstabbing finished you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Brace yourselves Republicans! If Carsons mindblowing stupidity makes its way through your national convention, you may want to kiss your Congressional majorities goodbye! Seriously, if youre going to nominate someone, nominate someone with a brain, like Rubio or Bush....maybe Kasich. Even Ted Cruz is pretty brilliant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Chris Wallace is too liberal to be on Fox News, its time to get rid of him. He is way too biased with a lot of stupid gotcha questions. None of them worked this time around. Great job Ben. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wait, what? this bitch is straight up wack, she is obviously attempting to appeal to the Hispanics of the country by making Cubans and Mexicans seem to appear to be in the same boat, as a Cuban American i find this whore and her bullshit insulting, fuck rubio and fuck cruz <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
theirs a difference between being Latino and uncle Tom lover. Rubio or Cruz do not represent the Latino. their last names might be Spanish and thats about it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

He doesnt answer the question and what he does say makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. For crying out loud. Listen to him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio just sounds like another politician. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love how Marco tries to sound all presidential! this idiot rubio has no clue what ISIS ia all about and now he claims to be the expert with the expert analysis! get tha fuck outta here! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kasich is awesome. Hes reasonable on social issues, and to the right on foreign policy. Thats exactly where you want to be in the general election. However, to win the nomination, you either need to be far right or you need to be really well known. Hes neither. If he ran in 2012, he would probably be the favorite to win the nomination now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio the dirty commie globalist douchebag , just like Hitlery <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, I call it the way I see it, it looks like Rubio has more intelligence than trump and Obama put together. Whoever says other wise needs to pay more attention and understand what they are saying and why they are saying it. Donald trump thinks everybody is stopped and dont know what they are saying, he thinks he is the only smart person, he calls everybody else stopped and so on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio knocks it out the park as usual clear, concise and articulate points on understanding the psychology tactics of isis, its absolutely true that the more they grow, the more people they attract to their cause from all around the world. We need to wipe them off the face of the earth and show the world were a force to be reckoned with. And yes with a humiliating defeat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In the final minute Rand talks about arming our enemies leading to the rise of Isis. Folks like Rubio supported the arming and now wants to fight those that now have our weapons. Funny how Friedrick Hayek describe the Marco Rubios of the world in his book the Road to Serfdom. The government creates a problem and is now saying they are going to fix the problem that they created if you elect me. Are we the dumbest country in the world by rewarding these people with power? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio looks like he could play the part of the Joker just add a little green paint lol!!! you think Obama is bad just vote for Rubio or bush then the jokes on you. TRUMP 2016!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
From a democrat I think Rubio would be the only threat to Hilary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lmao this guy is entertaining as shit. Republicans have no chance unless they elect Rubio or Kasich. Thatt why I hope Trump gets the red nomination, make it easy of us Democrats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

FREE PALESTINE and all these wars will go away. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im amazed by Senator Rubio s analysis on the psychology of ISIS. He is absolutely right! . They think they are unstoppable and the US needs to publicly humiliate them in an all out war. I know Truman and Churchill wouldnt be sitting around being politically correct about this. They would have attacked. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well said Mr Rubio. We must hold our anger in check. Request volunteers for spec ops teams to hit ISIS and sabotage their oil supplies. That means hitting their economics and stop all trade going into and out of ISIS territory. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio cant even get a bill passed in the Senate. He can barely do the job he has, all he does is run his mouth. Voters in Florida are pissed off he barely shows up for work but collects 100% paycheck, mainly freeloading off the citizens of Florida. Promised them the same thing he is promising all of America now. Rubio is a two bit hustler. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubio is useless <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Face it Republicans the closest thing you have to a Presidential candidate is Marco Rubio... who will lose to Hillary Clinton in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio you little cunt, you already did that in Abu Ghrabe and Guantanamo Bay you weirdo....Thats part of the reason they feel like they too can put people in Orange Jumpsuits and humiliate them. Fucking Yanki fuck ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One of the few things that Rand Paul is right on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Western liberals and leftists cant get enough of islam and muslims, and thats the price we have to pay. How many thousands of innocent people will have to die before the cowardly leftist traitors will open their eyes and see islam for what it is? Its not just ISIS propaganda, its islamic propaganda that we should worry about. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a barbarian. Disgusting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a Snake Oil Salesman you are deranged if you think this guy can fix anything. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a piece of shit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
911 terrorists, legal immigrants Boston bombers, legal immigrants Garland, Texas terrorists, legal immigrantshows defeating ISIS in Syria going to thwart Muslims here in America, Mr. Rubio? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is precisely what Senator Rubio has been talking about. The only way to help in stemming the tide of Islamist extremist is to have Muslims combat them on and off the battle field. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Putin is genius politician and if you Rubio think that he is a gangster and even call it reality then you are delusional. Putin has fed hungry ppl gave pensions back to elderly saved chechens from distraction saved Crimean from war sacred south Ossetians from being slaughtered and so on. What the freak have you ever done??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You can tell he is trying to push Rubio and Cruz. Both did a terrible job during the debate and have no chance in hell of beating Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Rubio is stupid for being a towtheline global warming denier, but he could make a decent President on complex issues like this. Hes a heck of a lot more refined than clowns like Trump and Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really like Rubio, his military build up is a good policy to stay ahead of China. But I hope its NOT used in Syria. We already rebuilt Iraq and spend trillions and many lives. Its time to let Russia waste their resources, as we watch from the sidelines. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whats wrong with kristi?... Yeah he is over weight but not crazy amounts. Other than his weight what dont you guys like about him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fiorina isnt a real woman. Ben Carson isnt really black. Cruz and Rubio are not real hispanics...... The GOP is nothing but old white male rapist pedo monsters who want to chain all women to a kitchen sink, murder all minorities, and get mad at people just for killing babies! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These idiots actually know that Rubio and others are bought. In Rubios case its the sugar cartel. And yet they ignore Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a big steaming pile of the same old same old. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio would be my second choice after Bernie Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is right about Rubio being liberal. Rubio said his plan was a refund for people with children, so when you dont have kids you have to pay for others who do. Sounds like welfare. 1 trillion more in military spending isnt conservative and its unnecessary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When i see Rubio in the above video, i see H 1B written on his forehead. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul won the last debate, second was cruz followed by Trump. Rubio was the biggest joke on stage and should not be in the Republican party. Rubio being such a commie globalist douchebag makes Carson look far better than he performed. Rubio and Chris Christie need to be kicked out of the party altogether. They are a complete joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Looks like Fox News had some Rubio plants in the crowd <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There are two wings of the party, one is Rubio, Bush, Christie, and other neocon RINOs. They are big spenders in office, just like George W. Bush was and his father. The other wing is true conservatives like Rand Paul, Justin Amash, Ted Cruz, and many others. Victory for Rubios wing means another 8 years of Bush style big spending, big bailouts, big war corporatism, and big surveillance state. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul made it crystal clear to the audience that Rubio is not a true conservative, Rubio is an establishment neocon rino. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Like Obama Rubio has the style to talk and debate in a clever likable way. Like Obama Rubio has no track records to speak of and no experiences. So like Obama he would be a very incompetent President. So why reject Obama if you are going to replace him with an over rated young Rubio? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio like Obama has the style to talk in debate but really nothing else. Like Obama the young Rubio has no track records to speak of and very little experiences. Like Obama Rubio would be very incompetent as President. Trump with Ben Carson as running mate would be awesome and will definitely make America Great Again! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump for the victory !!! If the Republicans Establishment brokers the Republican Convention to put BUSH OR RUBIO AS THE CANDIDATE TO FACE HILLARY , they will lose to her !!! AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY !!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Agree, you can like him or not, but Marco Rubio is so far the only candidate to got a chance against Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
with whats going in syria if I was republican which I would wanna be but trumps racism has forced me to be a Democrat. Rubio is your guy with his knowledge in national security and foreign policies! hes your man not the guy that blames china for everything when china wasnt even part of the deal! <#urls:0> <+emoji:4> <-emoji:3>
Marco Rubio is just a fear mongering neocon. Rand Paul won this exchange. HANDS DOWN! Rubio falsely called Rand an isolationist. Rand has called for a declaration of war on ISIS. In addition, unlike Marco, Rand doesnt want to arm those who burn down are flag.

Nothing about Rand Paul, even when going through all of the candidates at the end? Shocked. OReilly is a big spending neocon warhawk just like Rove and Rubio and Cruz and everyone else up there except Rand, the only true conservative. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio claims to want a New American Century while simultaneously supporting all the failed big government policies of the past century. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio, the DOD is fully funded up to its eyeballs. If the DOD needs more money which I doubt, they need to look inward and start cutting the fat in that agency. Im sure theres plenty of it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump a man with a vision on a mission, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, GO TRUMP GO, GOD SPEED DONALD TRUMP, A MAN WITH A PLAN. Rubio is trying to bluff us, Bush is just a piece of crap, nobody wants to hear what he has to say, as for the rest they could shine Mr. Trumps shoes, but I dont think he would pay them very much. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How much did Rubios backers donate to you Fox News to run this propaganda trash? And how much do you think that weasel, Frank, leading that room accepted donations from Rubios backers before setting this up? Corruption. Filth. You should be ashamed of yourselves <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump won again when has he ever lost at anything? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I loved when rand Paul called out Marco Rubio. Rubio got exposed <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kasich was so annoying, think about the children? Paul won his points make sense. Cruz was good again. Rubio is a liberal just like Bush. Im sick of all the sheeple praising security. We dont need to be rubbed on, or spyed on by the tsa sex offenders or nsa peeping toms. I didnt hear the word Freedom used once. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump and his bullshit populism. He will say anything. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sorry Fox. Your hero Bush failed, and your second hero Rubio cant break ground. Now, you help him by trashing the peoples hero, Ben Carson. Shame... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who charges 20,000 in personal expenses to a corporate card in the first place? And why were there more than 1,000 in late fees? Rubio deflecting in the way that he does and pivoting into political talking points shows what a snake this guy is. Hes very polished and quick on his feet, but the guy is all talk. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump did not file 4 BKs. That was 4 different companies that filed BK which Trump used the BK laws to his advantage and made those companies better. And you cant compare a business to your personal finances. That is a distraction by comparing apples to oranges in an attempt to take the attention off yourself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Willing to bet there will be very little policy substance in this debate, and GOP candidates will avoid personal responsibility by blaming the moderators. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The Republican party will choose Marco Rubio as its 2016 Presidential candidate. Carson is just there to sucker in the biblethumpers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love how 13 are my picks, though maybe not in that order. Any combo of them in the WH will be amazing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Get ready folks. Half of the debate is going to be wasted discussing what Carson did or didnt do when he was 14 years old. The other half is going to be wasted discussing Rubios credit cards. Its going to be a bigger waste of time than the CNN debate. The kiddy table debate will no doubt be much more informative. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio has been disloyal to Jeb, Rubio has been a disaster in usage of his credit card, Rubio has the backing of billionaires whom he addresses as masters. Above all Rubio is going to have WW3 over Syria. This mans thirst for power is pure personal. MONEY. For that he is willing to sell out his principles, his party, and his country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Those senators have no clue about real economics. Thats why this country is 17 trillion dollars in debt! Brian is a fool! The reason why Trump is leading is because he has made his companies lots of money while this country keeps losing money year after year. Brian, you need to find another career. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump is trash and a traitor. He was a friend with him last week talking nice things about him and now he want to you use these lies to destroy him. This is only going to help Carson . Dr. Carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson confesses his failings as a young person, and why is this wrong? People cant make up their minds. They dont like him because he supposedly was less than honest about Westpoint emphasis on supposedly. They dont like him because of his honesty about his flaws. This is nuts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

oh well i think they all suck its all about who sucks less should be the president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im so angry this great candidate is getting shoved off so much and is being ignored by the media. Leftist controlled media wants to put Donald Trump in the spotlight to shine his stupidity as representing the republican party, to turn people away and vote left. This hushes great candidates like Rubio who deserve the spotlight more than some idiot like Trump. Its just another way the leftist media is cheating the entire race, just like they did with Ron Paul in 2012. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Looks like Jeb is being dump by the establishment for Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What has Marco Rubio ever actually done? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox news is shooting Ben Carson over this ridiculous controversy? Oh please. The media have to dig really hard to find anything on Ben Carson. This is nothing but a hit job by the liberal media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Here is a difference between conservatives and progressives If Carson lied about West Point, we WANT to know, not to cover it up.Wacky libs look ideology first, truth second. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
marco rubio is a robot ahhhh run away!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He is a liar though. Yes others have lied, but Carson is no different. This guy cant even give a straight answer to policy questions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Best antiRubio commercial ever <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Media trying so hard to make Rubio important. Doesnt he have like 70% less of the votes in polls than the leaders? Just shows u this shit is fucked. How many times did they say the word surge? 3rd place is not a surge. FUCK MEDIA. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As long as Rubios safe, I dont care. And maybe Cruz too. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Still looking for a mentally sane Republican candidate for presidency ? Somehow i think we need to understand that such a thing does not exist anymore <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Solid, honest man. Just what are country needs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is CoSponsor of the bill to replace American workers with foreign workers in India. The ISquared bill of 2015 if passed, would triple the number of H1B visas used to send US jobs to India. The question is who is paying him to do this? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I believe rubio like I believe his hair line. #combover <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am Polish American. I will say dr. Carson has no idea what he is talking about. Only Donald Trump knows how to do internationals deals and communicate with current world leaders. Marco Rubio is a kid. Bush is low energy person. H. Clinton has no idea as dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As for Rubio being young, having money mismanagement, and being pro amnestyimmigration...I will not vote for him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck trump. Bitch ass born rich pig. Rubio and carson came from nothing and are self made men.trump probably never learned how to tie his own shoe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Marco Rubio is self made <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good answers on BLM by Rubio. He puts himself out there as intelligent, understanding and looks presidential. Very well could end up being the nominee <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what a difference a debate can make.... Rubio will be the nominated.... good bye entitled Bush.... Bush family... never thought they will have so many competitors... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes someones little puppet, you can take that to the bank. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont have any authority whatsoever.... what I can see is that, Trump attacked or counter attacked almost every candidate except Carson so far, which might be the reason why Carson has the chance to leapfrogged trump well beside the ad campaign that kicked in for carson recently. Look at Fiorina, Bush, and others.... The only 3 that surged were cruz, carson and rubio, and 2 out of the 3 werent attacked by Trump until a few days ago. that might means something.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You can tell Trumptard and all his supporters are scared of Rubio lol. Thats why they gotta keep bashing, while the younger Rubio is being the bigger man. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Marco Rubio wants to increase the number of H1B visas because he thinks Americans do not have the skills, then why are Americans required to train their replacements? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Super pacs and Media try to destroy Trump. It will be very hard but if they succeed, do you know who will be next ? Carson. And that will be much easier.

fox has and is always unfair to Cruz. It is obvious that the morning show pushes trump and the rest of the day pushes a moderate rubio or bush but now mostly rubio. for some reason fox has been becoming left and is contempt with a moderate which is no better than a liberal. Fox is NOT fair nor balanced <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
you cant even talk about Ted Cruz for 2 minutes you had to start talking about Marco Rubio and a segment about Ted Cruz because you despise Ted Cruz so much we all know the establishment Donald Trump establishment Jeb Bush establishment despised the great Ted Cruz <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will be voting for Marco Rubio in the primaries but I would definitely support Carson in a general election matchup against Hillary Clinton. God help us if she gets elected, this Country will crumble. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please Lord tell me these people are not the future of our party. Supporting Jeb, saying Trump is the most qualified. I do see some hope with the chick that said Cruz. More people than Rubio can beat Killary. We need a conservative not someone who plays one on T.V. please listen closely to what candidate say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They were cranking the heater during the fox debate thats why Rubio was drenched and pounding water. Trump never took a sip, he probably cant trust their water. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Rubio and kasich are probably the best candidates that the repubcliams can put up against Hillary or bernie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio just comes across to me like your typical blue sport coat Republican. The status quo. He wants to get elected so that he can be President. Not so that he can help America. All of his responses are so prepared, as if he has been coached over and over on how to respond to questions. To me he would just be another Bush term. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carly is incredibly smart and quick on her feet in a debate scenario, im sure she will rip these women apart on Friday. I cant wait! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

TED CRUZ initiated that whole attack on the liberal media. All the other FOLLOWED HIM. Not Trump, nor Rubio, nor this Carson LEAD the way...they followed TED CRUZ.

Rubio has no stats as a player. Hes .000 and he is deep in the pockets of the establishment RNC leadership. Bottom line, Rubio is just another RINO.

You mean the final 3, Trump, Carson, Fiorina. These are the only people we are interested in. They have never held an elected office. The rest of them are participants in betrayal except maybe Cruz and Paul. Cruz maybe for Attorney General. Paul for IRS secretary. The rest of the lot should get out, especially Rubio, Jeb, and Fat Boy. Not to mention that habitual liar who all Marines Hate, Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We Told you Fat Boy, We do not want our Troops in Syria. We are tired of He is killing his own people Excuse. We are sick of that same old line. You will never be President.

WHAT RUBIO IS SAYING ,,IF OTHERS DONT SHOW UP FOR WORK ,,WHY SHOULD HE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has a messianic complex, is obviously enamoured with himself, and thinks he is Gods gift to the world. I can and will do without him and vote for Rubio, the only REALLY qualified GOP candidate offering real solutions to the nations problems with a proven record. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
... bullsh, Rubio was MENTORED by John Ellis Bush. Really phoney b.s. And now little Rubio has the taint of having a vulture hedge fund manager BILLIONAIRE supporter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Christie and Fiorina have absolutely no chance at all of winning, and they should be dropped... Their numbers continue to drop... The Top 4 should be the only ones left in the debates... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a good guy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I support Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It was obvious Rubio and Cruz and Christie won this debate. Carson and Trump were right in the middle of the pack. Carson and Trump will remain at the top. But i predict the next poll with have Carson, Trump Rubio Cruz at the top 4 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kasich is one of the few potty trained Republican left. The entire party has gone full retard. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is a joke I actually like Jeb Bush but would never vote for him because of his brother. Rubio seems like hes all talk. Slimy politician. Huckabee is a joke lol Kinda like Carson Cruz is cool but too right wing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone know whos having a sale on Quentin Tarantino movie DVDs ? Maybe some of you murderin pigs want to sell your DVDs, huh ?. Youll need the money to pay for your homicide defense once Trump or Rubio gets sworn in. Ill pay 5 cents per DVD set, if theyre in perfect condition. NO pits NO scratches. Fingerprints are welcome.

Fox News is fucking DESPERATE for Marco Rubio to become the frontrunner. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio has hardly any track record which is why him missing so many votes is problematic. You cant compare McCain and Rubio in this respect. I fear Rubio is all talk just like Obama. Id rather have someone with experience. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Champion of political correctness Ben Carson wants the debate moderators to be politically correct and not challenge him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Harry Reid <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio mopped the floor with him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush stinks of desperation. His weakness on illegal immigration makes him an extremely unappealing candidate. Cant wait till he drops out so his points can go to other republicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only talking heads whining about the CNN moderators or their ?s are the racist, sexist, homophobic Republi cans their ilk. IMO the moderators were razor sharp fact checked those blow hards around every turn. The debate was awesome, but now I bet the next one will be stacked with right wing types will be a total snooze fest, every one of these Republic bafoons getting on their soap boxes to run out the two hours st8 into an old rerun of The Golden Girls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio needs to show up to work and learn to pay his mortgage before he can be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio just sounds like another politician. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is full of shit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kasich is the best candidate on the right and his party is too stupid to realize it. Vote Trump, you morons. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the questions thrown were a mix of subtle insults and misread numbers and statements. Harwood and Quick are a disgrace to their profession. Harwood on misreading or lying on Rubios tax plan and Quick on misreading the phrase on Trumps website on the HBVisas. These people are disgusting!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Many white people will never want to see a latino like Rubio win, even though hes the best. so they side with trump hitler <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is a false a attack setting up the mainstream to boost THERE polls numbers. bush will pick Rubio as his vp. bush is pulling a TRUMP...Trump 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump was just laying back and still won the debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump, Rubio, Cruz. Christie WTF?!?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LMAO FOX News fair and balanced? wow! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump all day! Cruz is alright but sorta sounds like an infomercial. Marco Rubio seems like he would have a very proillegal promexico agenda instead of being for America. Christie is a sellout shill statist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In the long run Cruze,Rubio,Chris,Carson and Trump would be way way way better presidents then hitlery or Bernie Chavez <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Exclude the name bush from jebs name and his numbers on the polls fall, dramatically. Jeb Bush is getting his getting his votes from name recognition. Marco Rubio is the only GOP candidate that has a chance of beating the democratic nominee . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio should never be allowed to become a US president, he is an insane CUBAN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The candidate that is the worseMarco Rubio. Barely doing the job he has, and, he lied, made promises to Florida voters, to get in the Senate. But, barely shows up for work. Add his poor money management skills to his lack of character and work ethic and you have Obama 2.0 the GOP version. He is hands down unqualified for the job. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If were gonna thin the heard, then for the love of god, get rid of those who are polling lower than Hilary! So that would only leave Bush, Carson, Rubio, and I think thats it! Hell, Cruz is getting beat by Clinton by 13 points in... the Fox News poll! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RUBIO So its ok go miss the votes if others have done the same or worse. Are we aiming for a higher standard or some more mediocrity. And lets all attack the moderators and each other. These people are good at that and not making any good relevant points or getting anything done. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont think these people get it. Trump doesnt hunt for party support. He has he general populous support. We decide not the GOP. Rubio is a whack and has no chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio couldnt pay his mortgage either. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio needs to dropout we cant rely on a man who never attends meetings. The Used Car Salesmen Ted Cruz whos trying to usurp Rand Pauls supporters, and that hack George Pataki should follow suit. Way too much deadwood. Lets get it down to a single debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This goof Rubio was chirping about slackers in the government. Meanwhile he is becoming a Kim John Un look alike and never attends meetings. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Senator Ted Cruz crucified the CNBC Moderators! Home Run! All of GOP questions is an attack. Contrast that with the Democrat Debate! LOL Which one of you is the most Handsome Wise ? President Trump V.P. Cruz 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is likable but he comes across as almost too slick sometimes, almost like a sociopath. In contrast to Cruz, whos also very smart and is gifted when it comes to speaking, but knows when hes grandstanding and owns it. Rubio has more of a treacherous quality to me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think its funny how the conservatives always love Fox News when they are doing their Obama Hillary hate routine, but then theyre mad when they support biggovernment conservative candidates like Bush and Rubio. Why? They are nothing but a propaganda wing of the establishment and the power elite. Its not that hard to figure out. They arent on your side. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RNC and FOX have clear bias for Rubio. HYPOCRITES! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump said he didnt call Rubio Zuckerbergss Personal Sentor. But.. it turns out he did actually said that on his web site?? And you guys think he won the debate?? I thought he did okay but this Zuckerbergs thing nearly destroyed him and I think hell trails in the new polls. I think Cruz and Rubio both won the debates. The loser was Bush, he should drop out now. CNBC are also the losers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There you go again.The mainstream media trying to impose on people whos the winner. Marco rubio winner on immigration,really? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
KASICH IS AN IDIOT. RUBIO IS A MODERATE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU FOX????!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well the establishment got a new golden boy , Marco Rubio is now being pushed by the pundits on all the news stations. They must think fox viewers never got past kindergarten using those ridiculous signs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a surprise. Krauthammer liked Rubio. Amnesty will kill the country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trumps closing statement at the end of the debate was epic. He won the debate with that closing statement right there. The nomination is over...the rest can go home. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
After seeing this debate, If you still dont believe that the liberal propaganda media wants to destroy any and all vestiges of Conservatism then you yourself are a brainwashed liberal moron that should work in the fetus sales department at Planned Parenthood. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio won, but CNBC lost to all debaters <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In my opinion, I think the CNBC moderators did a hell of a lot better job than the Fox panel. And I love how the audience cheered when both Rubio and Cruz called them out on it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Props to all republicans finally unifying. Tonight was a great step for all the candidates. They completely destroyed those moderators. The false claims they put against Trump, and Carson was absolutely ridiculous. Props to Cruz and Huckabee for standing up for their rivals. Very strong night for everyone that isnt named Rubio, Bush, Kasich. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There are too many people on the stage.. the Dem debate had like 4 on stage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wait i thought Conservatives wanted smaller Government... now you want the State to tell every county who they can and cant elect?? how convenient <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is full of crap. Rand has a nearly flawless voting record, Sanders is doing fine, even Cruz has an ok record. He just sucks at his job. Thats it. He showed up recently just to say that government employees who dont show up for work should be fired. Lol you cant make this up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope Rubio, Fiorina and Kassich stand out. Any one of These 3 can kick Hillarys ass in the general, basically assuring a win for the GOP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RUbio needs to get out of this race, no track record <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Funny, if it was bush and Rubio on top they would be referring them to being on the top tier. But because its trump and Carson, they are sure that the polls really dont matter. Had it been any other 2 polling the same the media would be talking a different story <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Paul has time. His message is solid, and regular. In time, Cruz, Bush, Rubio and Huckabee will all fall off, and Paul will gain steam as the attacks are intensified, and platforms are scrutinized. He is the best Republican candidate to offer who can win swing votes. So I think his campaign will grow in the spring of next year if he hangs in tough. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Turd Blossom is still polishing the Bush familys turds. Jeb is doomed and the GOP will crumble under the idiocy of Trump and Carson, which is one step from President Commacho. Rubio? Ha! There is no chance for our young and thirsty friend. Face it right wingnuts your going to have to start Feeling the Bern if you want to back a winner. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Boy, Fox is really scared of Ted Cruz. Even though he is #3 on their poll, they cut his name out and only show Rubio and Bush as if Cruz didnt even register. I bet this anchor got in trouble for accidentally verbally mentioning that Cruz was in 3rd place. Fox should be ashamed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubiokasich 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

kasich 2016 the only decent candidate!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wrong. NBC would offer them a chance to host. Bad idea because there would be a backlash against the candiates. Ben Carson would like generate as much interest as Trump. Killary has already had her turn, Hahahahahahah. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio joined the Senate for the notoriety and the future pay check. One term and out then hes gonna take that big lobbying job he probably already has lined up. Running for the presidency is a shot in the dark for him that I believe he knows he doesnt have a chance in hell of winning. Hes doing that for the money, and again the notoriety so he can command more money in that dream lobbying job he cant wait to get. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will vote for Rubio <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

There are plenty of people that refer to themselves as free market capitalists that dont support cutting all regulations and privatizing everything the government currently controls.

A fact that cant be denied by either side. Bush, Rubio, Clinton... They are all complete puppets to Koch, Soros, Wall Street... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio is just like another politician who wants to lie to seem better. if he had more money he could have just flat out said so. be proud of ur money and say that u got it, instead of moving around the question with a misleading answer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If they are putting Biden in there they are desperate as fuck! Biden had a brain tumor removed and part of his brain along with it.. thats why he has no filter..

Ted, No one cares about you and we know you lie 60% of the time. Which makes you as bad as Hilary. Rubio, lib vs lib,great you found out this was a democratic debate. My question is why cant Republican debates have hard questions like the Democratic Debate, instead of Trump said this and what is your response, Trump you get to respond. That would actually imply Republicans have polices to talk about instead of wedge issues to glorify. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump Wins 2016 and selects Ben Carson as vice president and us American people win. In 2024 Ben Carson Wins and selects Marco Rubio as vice president and once again us American people win. Repeat the trend <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Clinton Campaign and the Democrat Party are specialists at the personal destruction of individuals. Ya like the Email scandal republicans admitted were to hurt Hillarys campaign? Okay, bud. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is a joke, Jeb Bush is a joke, Marco Rubio is a joke, Ted Cruz is a joke, Ben Carson is a joke, The Republicans are a joke, Fox News is a joke. But none of this is making me laugh anymore. The games over, Bernie Sanders is going to win, and we will get the money out of politics. Then media channels like Fox News will have to earn their money the old fashioned way by actually doing real reporting and not taking bribes from the rich. We will get our democracy back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio or Cruz will win in the end . If you elected trump as rep. Candidate, allies, not rest of the world start to hate america. However, trump has a point ..still, he is unbelievable amateur and his 3 rd wife is Slovenian lingerie model and also immigrant . He has no right to attack Jeb bushs Mexican wife, okay with accusation like him. My question is Do you really want a Slovenian model as First Lady, conservative people ? Are you France? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Republicans have wasted their opportunity to lead. They got nothing done at all while in control of the senate and congress. This is why they will be thrown out of office in 2016. Repubs have ONE idea,,, cut taxes for the rich and increase military and police spending. When trickle down economic, perpetual war, and mass imprisonment failed they were out of ideas. Nothing is left but a hollow shell. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To me..personally...the perfect candidate is one with Obamas views, but Marco Rubios military mentality. ..John Kasich is surprisingly close to fitting that bill <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

He just recently paid off his student loans and is the biggest lightweight in this race. Not only does he need to drop out of this race, he needs to leave the United States senate. he has been a horrible senator and is bought and paid for by the Washington lobbyist. Go back to Florida, Marco! #Trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump saying about Rubio He only had 12 in the bank lololol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OMG I nearly fell off my couch yesterday, Trump was being interviewed on CNN and he was talking about Rubio and he said Rubio is a lightweight, he only has 12 in the bank lololol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubio has the brain of a chicken. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this Jamie Weinstein is either Rubios brother or husband <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RUBIO IS A SHILL... HE IS JUST AS BAD AS HILLARY THE WITCH CLINTON <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think a RubioFiorina ticket is what the Ass Party fears most. And that idiot Kevin McCarthy should sit back down, shut up, and let someone with brains and some conservative courage lead the House. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
IS RUBIO LOYAL TO US OR HIS MOTHERLAND ? if Marco win forget about amerce , it will be Mexico , and the the other will be minority, look what Mexican did to Mexico, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow this cohen is even a bigger clown than trump!! michael cohen 2016!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is the best, but this whole drama with the Fox embargo followed by reconciliation is, I think, all for show. It pumps up the ratings of both Trump and Fox. By the way, regarding Rubio is a clown, remember that OReilly calls people pinheads every day for a living. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubios long term biggest contributor is Goldman Sachs. Thats all I need to know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This don trump spokesperson is a carnival barker, he is awful. But very appropriate for trump. A couple of unsavory characters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubio is a clown..supports common core and loves amnesty <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WHO cares about Rubio say...? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I LOVE This guy!!! We need more Michael Cohen!!! MICHAEL COHEN ROCKS!!!! This is exactly the kind of people we need to put those smug arrogant little knowitall college brat media types in their place. MORE MICHAEL COHEN, MORE MICHAEL COHEN, MORE MICHAEL COHEN!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Cohen vs. Weinstein Whos propping up the politicians? lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is Not His own man. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is absurd. Rubio is not serious and attracts about 1% the attention that Trump attracts. No one cares what Rubio has to say no one even knows what Rubio has to say on issues. What is the Rubio plan on ...anything? No one can answer that question...except maybe 1%. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im hoping for Carson or Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump wasnt wrong about Rubio. Rubio is the water boy and Trump a Champion <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is the only one right about Russia.Let Russia have the useless muzzies. Rubio and Fiorina are the same old traditional neocons. It is time we are represented differently. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good Job Fox. Dont mention Donald attacking Rubio for his push for amnesty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio has no idea what we in Europe think about that clown, please do not vote for this douchebag, he has no Idea how to rule a country like USA. Vote for Trump, he knows how to run a business. He is smart and care more about US then about Israel,Iraq,Iran or whoever, cheers from Germany. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He just doesnt have what it takes to be president.Trump will win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is such a bright man...People please no more political assumption please... please get this man on the power who has the solutions for people. Dr. Ben Carson is such a good man who wants to listen and collaborate with people... God bless America <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really like carson and enjoy listening to him talk but I must go with trump he just has that natural leader feel...also fox news takes the time to hunt down the best poll where trump has lower % but they wont take the time to find the legit good polls where trump is ahead by alot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The corrupt billionaire Koch Brothers now getting ready to FUND Fiornia... Carson and Rubio are already in the hippockets of his billionaires!

Im a democrat who is watching Rubio closely. This guy has a good chance. Young, wellspoken with a strong character. Something like a Republican Obama. I hope he tones down the republican rhetoric a bit if he does make it to prime time. Kasich is also a GREAT republican candidate, but seems like the public, or media has little interest in him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr. Gang of 8 doesnt stand a chance and his taunting of Putin will only get the US into WW3. Rubio is an idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I watch middleeast news, and I heat what arab, Iranians, and Russian analysts say...and Rubio is the only one who truly gets it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio hasnt outgrown his ears! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is an idiot political pussy. He will say he thinks the brainwashed Americans need to hear to stay in their coma. Good job boy...atta boy dont wake em up. Besides the powers that be want Clinton as president. You can not have a feudal state with armed Americans and she is big time against an informed public that has the right to own and bear arms. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
putin liar? yeah right lol, hes the only one whos been making sense. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Disgusting media controlled by the jews... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i support trump 100%, but everytime i see a picture or a clip or a video of him i always see him very distressed. why does he look like that all the time?! whatever is bothering him, he should ignore it and focus on the presidential race. #trump2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is back to where he was because some other candidates are getting 9s. Trump surged to 3040 because Bush and Walker were plummeting. Now its Fiorina and Rubio. But just wait until people find out what they are worth. He will stay in the lead by a great margin and outrun everyone again soon. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
you know what Im pretty sure fox news has made 11 videos or more in the last month about how donald trump is going down in polls which probably just backfires and helps him go up in polls lol nice try fox trump 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio lost me on this one. There is no such thing as a good or moderate terrorist. Russia is going to get rid off ALL terrorist and leave Assad. Sound good to me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a disaster. Sweaty child that should not be even near the Senate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is brainless he speaks like a uneducated spoil brat. This guy is a danger to himself and the world dont listen to this thug. His view towards Syria are beyond stupid and his ideas are childish. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio you are no conservative putin is much smarter than Obama and your still shiting yellow you are going to lose votes <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trump 2016, only one ready to step against the Establishment and bring back a real American values <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I thought Bush and Rubio were bad until I heard this grotesque, selfhating, Rino faggot with the Perry specs. Not someone you want to meet in the mens restroom. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush may be bad but Rubio is a greasy piece of traitorous shit who should be deported. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How big a setback is it fantastic answer from Rubio who shows that it is not about Syria its just showing that US is the macho biggest kid in the playground! When he talks about the national interest he is really talking about protecting the Zionists in Israel. His dream of a Sunni coalition fighting against the Shiite Assad Regime and its Shiite Allies in IragIran shows how little he understands the regions politics. It would generate a far more massive civil war. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
shut up rubio nobody likes you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh Rubio ! Did you think Russia would give them the road to Damascus! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What is this guy talking about??? Rubio is the leading candidate of the ESTABLISHMENT? LOL,,, Cruz , Christie and Bush are all more experienced than Rubio! what is this guy smoking?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please someone arm Rubio and send him to Syria. He seems ready to fight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio, you are weak, you wont do anything to Putin. The Russian leader wouldnt even give you the time of day. Go back to your lego blocks and let men of action like Trump handle it. Thats right action, the thing you havent done in the Senate while Obama has his way with you. Grow a backbone and try again for 2025. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
KasichRubio Cant lose in general <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio has no idea. There is a choice between ISIS and Jabat Al Nusra and that is all. This guy has no clue. Moderate FSA does not exist. The only sustained charter of the insurgents is the Quran and Hadith. There are no rebels fighting for liberal constitutional secular democracy or any other modern ideology. Marco Rubio is another clown. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a pawn. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is stupid .... Rubio knows where its at ..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The redemption for Bush is that Rubio is just as establishment and have the same talking points. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
NO BUSH NO CLINTON. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Political process is elections. With Rubios logic they should select Republicans nominee with guns but not debates. Syria should be cleaned from all kinds of terrorists and then international community should force Syrian government to have free elections. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuk You, Rubio............youre a dumbass. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is another Obama... We sure dont want him for a President! Its bad enough that hes a Senator... Everyone know that the FSA is ISIS... They need to back off and let Putin get rid of them... He will do it and ObamaMcCain wont! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this guy is so clueless or trying to kiss ass to the puppet masters but the truth he is far from it do your research Mr Rubio laughing at you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a controlled puppet by the jews.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Congratulations Marco Rubio. You are getting a free blow job from Kelly lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its political, but Hillary still guilty for Benghazi and so much more. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Marco Rubio wants war so bad let Marco and his family go to Syria and fight them, We all know hes nothing but a chicken hawk this pussy only want to send other peoples kids to fight for the world bankers and corporations. Marco Rubio should be in a cage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio , grab your rifle and go fight dem russkies <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio makes good speeches. Barack Obama makes good speeches, too. Other than speeches, what does Rubio actually bring? I like Rubio, dont get me wrong, but I just need substance over style. I need more than just another good speech. What has Rubio... done? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why cant Carson say this..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump posted a video of Rubio totally subservient to jewish donors. Rubio is a typical politician who bends his values for cash and even tried to pass obamas amnesty program. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Finally....somebody in the GOP that is honest about the police <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio seems to know what he is talking about on foreign policy but is his record on immigration reform stinks .... and he doesnt seem to be working for the people with his absentees in Congress .... Cruz is much better at doing his actual job .... what about his views on taxes and the economy .... Trumps plan seems better <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio let Russia fight Isis. Why are we getting into all these wars. We got in it in Iraq and they didnt even thank us. We have our own problems here. There will never be peace in the middle east. Rubio will never get my vote. Hes another Rino. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Didnt Rubio call the Trump campaign a freak show? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is the only guy running for the Republicans who knows WTF hes talking about when it comes to foreign policy. Trump is a complete moron who doesnt know didly squat and just spouts generalities that are popular with fellow ignorant imbeciles. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio, you are all over the place. You want to rule the Middle East and have no idea how to do it so give it up and take care of America. Let Russia figure out Syria. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubios response to you Megyn is Duuuuuhhhh! I wonder if Megyn thinks thats sexist to be told how obvious it was to figure out what Russia is doing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubio is a clown <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio sweats like a pig just look at that shiny forehead. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio predicted nothing. Do a search on the committees he sits on. The man is in the Know Zone. Russia has been putting out signals about what it intends to do in Syria and for Syria since well before the last Republican debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Let them take out ISIS then...we or whomever take out Assad. Its one or the other. I say a planned strategy or one then the other. I suppose Trump kinda had a good perspective on it. With that said though, Rubio essentially wanted to prop up other middle east citizens to do the fighting. This is a plan with far too many variables. With such a dangerous situation, you can TRUST anyone. Let Putin have it of it means the rest of the planet is less one more threat in the end. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
screw you rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a waste of breathing air. RUBIO WILL NEVER NEVER BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HIS IS MISSING GOOD WORK ETHIC. HE DISPLAYS CORRUPT BEHAVIOR. HE SOUNDS LIKE THE CORRUPT MEXICAN PRESIDEN. IS HE AN ANCHOR BABY? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio is for amnesty and open borders not good. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
screw rubio, he loves to give our money to foreign aid, hes a dam war monger and punk bitch, he acts like a cop, an assholle, he supports the most evil greedy and violent hated country ISRAEL, I am a high information person but this is the first election I will participate in, Im 48 years old, GO TRUMP. if anyone other then trump gets nomination, I will vote democrat just because its rigged by special interest donors, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is such a child. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I liked Rubio because he was silent about Trump. Just made me want to vote Trump even more. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio will be exiting the race soon...lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its too bad Rubio and Trump have issues. That would be the perfect ticket. Trumps celebrity and passion and Rubios knowledge on policy and his Hispanic background. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am from FLORIDA.... Marco Rubio has the worst attendance record in the Senate. Rubio was pushing hard for Amnesty..... Floridians do NOT trust him!.... So what if he is good at his Debate Skill? Thats all he is, a smooth talker. He has done NOTHING for Florida... absolutely NOTHING..... so why is the FOX promoting him? Because he has the SUPPORT of the Koch Brothers and the Corrupt Establishment. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio makes a great point about Iran and their motives for nuclear weapons. Using common sense why would you give Iran nuclear weapons capability. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Rubios military stance.. I hope he tones down the Republican rhetoric a bit if he makes the general election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
go Putin Rubio is a globalist puppet! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio obviously works for the globalist RINO <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump calling Rubio a clown was putting it nicely!! Most of these has been failed politicians are the worst of the worst, and the countrys downfall is a direct reflection of that very failure. In that respect Trump is very presidential to call a spade a spade. A fair question would be why does Oreilly not get that part, or the importance of it. Trump 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh Rubio needs to shut up. Hell bring us to WW3 should he ever get into office.Same with Fiorina. Trump 2016. Hes right about Russia.We need to work together. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I cant wait to call him President Trump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Screw Rubio! Hes nothing put another paid for worthless CLOWN that does nothing except what he is told to do. LOOK AT THIS COUNTRY and remember Rubio is responsible for why it is in the shape it is because he and all the other worthless politicians put America in the spot it is. Anyone who does not show up to vote should be removed from office unless they were in the hospital! Thats the kind of DO NOTHING DO AS THEY TELL YOU piece of crap he is! TRUMP 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
is it presidential to call another countrys president a gangster? whats wrong with these gop candidates? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump should have just confirmed yeah Rubio is a clown Its it Presidential to call him that? He should have just said Yeah its Presidential because I say it is.... then it would be all over. Putin says that kind of shit all the time and look at him, he is the leader of the free world and protector of civilization. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hey Rubio isis us proxies army you dumb beaner <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio looks cock eyed and coked out <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
True. Rubio is part of that out of touch political class. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Koch Brothers are supporting Bush, Rubio, and Fiorina..... So its NOT a surprise for those who are paying attention that......all FOX wants to talk about now are Bush, Rubio, and Fiorina. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a Child that has problems of his own. Amnesty for one. First term senator for two. Never did anything close to Trump in building anything. And from past statements we would not be in the current mess we find ourselves in in the middle east. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Your dear colleague FRANK LUNTZ has said that they only booed in agreement with Trump when he called Rubio a Clown. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Rubio, but I like trump better. I just wish Trump didnt want to deport illegals. I wish he would just have them do community service building the wall to gain citizenship. I love the Hispanic people, and I do think they should face some type of charges if they came in illegally, but sending them back could be very expensive, and it doesnt sound humane. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RINO Rubio is NOT a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN as required to be President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
he only got booed calling him a clown, cuz that clown had already spoke to those people before trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If they think Rubio and his Gang of 8 are going to break out, he should hold his breath now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
marco Rubio for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush along with Fiorina, Cruz, and Rubio are H1B visa scam supporters and therefore traitors to the American middle class. No vote on Jeb...shill to Indian lobbyists and overpaid tech execs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really love how ironic this video is. Trump once again, having the gall to slam Carly Fiorina for how she led her company when Trump BANKRUPTED FOUR BUSINESSES. Fox isnt going to bring up that fact though. Talk about glass houses and stones whenever Trump opens his mouth! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The last thing the world needs is a fifth term from a BUSH ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My choice will be Rubio because his ideas best represent America to the world though acknowledging his father s family are asylum seekers from Cuba , which is unfair disadvantage for him in political arena. Carson , Fiorina are simply incapable of doing commander in chief and moderators, and trump is liberal his current wife is Slovenian lingerie model And true ignorant of foreign affairs Can Rubio beat Bernie Chavez? Yes! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is the most fitted American candidate so far. He is an immigrant family from Cuba So, He cherishes best American values than bush family or Clintons. He knows how economy works in practice and exactly understand what freedom is in every aspect of human lives . With all that said , he is real conservative and Reaganism In national security and foreign policy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
is islam consistent with the constitution is a very loaded question. i dont think there was a way for him to answer this question without pissing someone off. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is all talk and no action. VOTE TRUMP! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Team Rubio. Im not here for Secretary of State Omarosa. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio, Im writing you off. Until this video, I really liked you. Im actually glad you revealed your true nature as an advocate for victim mentality. Now I can scratch you off of my very short list of legitimate Presidential candidates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
herr Bohner youre too liberal beter the hard guys Robin Batman Trump or Marco Rubio <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Trump, but not for president. If he gets the nod, Hillary will scoop up ALL the Hispanic, Black, Gay, Muslim, Feminist, and Moderate voters, which collectively are a landslide. Trump is a typical CEO, he says and behaves as he wishes because the minions would never challenge him. The American public does not work that way, and they will certainly not forget or forgive his behavior. Fiona, Carson, or even Rubio are the only ones that have any shot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who is Kaish ... Ha , ha .... I like Trump, Cruz, Christie, Rubio, or Fiorina ... the rest have issues <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You want to compare policies? Trump has detailed policies on his site, rubio has a series of 50second youtube videos. Dont believe me? Check for yourself <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is an anchor baby who will bring in more latinos <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need someone to stop illegal immigration ... bring back jobs and companies, decrease the deficit, and strengthen the military ... My money is on Rubio , Cruz, Fiorina, Christie, or Trump having the best chance at pulling it off ....... Bush and Carson dont have the leadership qualities needed IMHO ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The real surprise was that he was ever considered a viable candidate he is a creation of party insiders who were looking for their perfect candidate, completely independent of anything in the interest of the people. They found him, and dumped 35M into his campaign, and it has all gone pair shaped. Rubio is next guaranteed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio just got his ass handed to him yet again in this interview. Hes a BABY and a Jeb Bush MINIME ! People are sick of ESTABLISHMENT Republicans and that is why the polls are the way they are. Give us a DARN WALL...Give us Our Jobs back that got sent to China by liberal bastards and restore the nation as a beacon of the world instead of going galavanting around the planet spending TAX PAYER MONEY on stupidity. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Like I said before Rubio is not smart enough to be president...He is still in diapers. Theres nothing wrong to go there but to do it on a Jewish Holiday is the stupidity of it, that shows his inexperience. You gotta be smarter than that during campaigns. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love this mans integrity and honesty. Will be a great president. Carson Rubio great ticket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You only need 1 brain cell to understand what Carson was saying, why does American media always take a snippet from a conversation and turn it into a controversy? Trump was asked we have a problem with Muslims.....? No one fussed abut that question. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has better policies than the child Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As I really observed Carly Fiorina speaking at the second debate, I didnt feel she was steelyeyed so much as she was glacial and callous, almost cold and hardhearted. Could that be what Mr. Trump meant? After all she eliminated jobs when she was a CEO with the same heartlessness I experienced when my professional position was eliminated and was told to clear my office in one hour. I feel Mr. Trump as president and Marco Rubio would be a good team. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thin skinned Trump cant handle the slightest criticism. How can he handle dealing with Putin and all the other threats and tough decisions that comes with foreign policy? Donald neanderthal Trump has no chance of getting elected. Go back to filing bankruptcy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People .......................what have the republicans and democrats done for you in the last 15 years? Wars,deficits, dream act,executive order for amnesty, worldwide recession, ISIS, China and Russia taking over ect! And you want to vote for establishment Rubio and establishmentbacked Carly who abandoned the teaparty in 2010 because she did not believe in them and and attacked Boxer on her looks! And dont let me get started on Clinton or Sanders! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio was very impressive in the 2nd debate. People are talking about Fiorina because she grilled on Trump, but Rubio made strong points of his own merit and elevated above the nitpicking Fiorina indulged in. He put himself on the radar big time. Trump vs. Rubio, I dont think Fiorina has a chance and I dont think Carson has the leadership ability to have a real chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think the debate winning order was Rubio, Fiorina, Christie, Cruz, Bush, Trump, Carson, Paul, Huckabee, Kaisch, and Walker .... does anyone else have an opinion??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush and Rubio are the dynamic duo! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i like Trump but being completely honest he definitely did not win that debate. i actually think he did pretty poorly but people have trouble putting aside emotions. i think fiorina, rubio and cruz did the best. hard to say who won it. id probably say fiorina won. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio voted against his own immigration bill. Actually, the GOP loves illegal workers bc they work for Mexican wages they even have Walker who wants Americans to work for pesos, too. Wanna be a serf? Then, vote Republican. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Krauthammers Zionist agenda is always so apparent. weak on Iran from him means Not pandering to the Supremacists in TelAviv. Rubio is exactly the sort of controllable politician that the Zios want to groom for the Presidency. He will make a great puppet they think. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I think Rubio wants to be president so bad he would say or do anything! Anything! Even go to Israel and lick Netanyahus boots, or whatever if that is what it takes. Shame on you and others like you! You and maybe all but three people debating a day ago should RUN off that stage!! The two doctors can stay and John Kavich. Hopefully voters can see past the mainstream media! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio you are full of crap. You and the rest are making this a political football. You are not the measure of a statesman and good American. Do whats best for America!!!!! The experts know this is a reasonable deal and most of the civilized people of other countries do too! Even the majority of Jews thinks this deal is good! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio needs to just go to Israel and lick Netanyahus boots till his tongue falls off! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I gave Rubio and Bush the win. What I learned is that the GOP has a lot of serious candidates. I think it will come down to Bush, Walker, Kasich, or Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cmon Fiorina, you and everyone else KNOW what Trump is referring to the ANNOYING persona that your FACIAL EXPRESSIONS convey STOP PLAYING THE GENDER CARD, Ya HYPOCRITE. Are you a helpless dame, under duress or an adult? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN and the RNC want Trump,Cruz,Walker to get dropped. Thats why they not only agreed to control the debate, they wanted to instigate arguing among the candidates so they couldnt discuss solutions to the destructive forces ruining our country. Fiorina jumped right on the Hillary bandwagon trying to portray Trump as a misogynist. Fiorina, Bush, Rubio, Huckster, Kasich, and Christie should be elbowed out back to their ass kissing underworld they crawled out of. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Man he did an amazing job during the debate but he is too against Marijuana. Why are you against Marijuana when everyone knows its harmless? Its not 1950 anymore and the republicans need to realize this if they want to pull in the younger voters.

what a fagg <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz, Carson, Rubio, and Fiorina all had amazing debates, hell even Christie. I think they are the top 5 that have a shot at actually being competent as potus. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox defends Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio all the establishment , proamnesty, RINO traitors. Then Fox attacks all the principled outsiders, Trump, Carson this surprised me because I thought Carson did well and Im a Trump fan so it exposes Krauthammer for his phony establishment views, and a backhanded compliment to Rand, but then goes on to compliment Christies pathetic night. Christie did NOT look good... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio !!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carly Fiorina won? what a joke. Ive noticed fox and cnn keep repeating that but social media proves otherwise <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush and Fiorna were a mess, time for them to drop out they just are not POTUS material. It is either Trump, Christie, or Rubio... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rove I think Rubio did well AGAIN Pay attention to the again term, everyone. Rubio TANKED after the first debate. Also, how can Rove be objective grading a guy who just called him a jerk? Seriously? Recuse yourself <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree the format was unfortunate. Poor Carson looked appauled and its not his thing to get down in the mud, he has too much class, so this was unlucky for him. I was especially impressed with Fiorina and I thought Rubio was studied and composed. Christy did not dissapoint, I expected him to lean in and he did. The first debate hosted by Fox was much better. Mr Krauthammers analysis was exactly what I came away with as well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
agreed fiorina 1st Rubio 2nd Bush 3rd <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im leaning toward trump. But this guy has a point Donald trump has not really given a strategy how to change the country. The media should ask serious questions. Ask Rubio if he support amnesty make him break we would see if hes worthy to be president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This Rubio is tied with Jeb for my least favorite candidate. Rubio, do yourself a favor drop out and save your money <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I respect Rubio, but lost interest when every speech was a repeat of the same story about his parents. If he can stay in his lane and not bash Trump, Im interested in hearing what he has to say tomorrow. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is pulling away bc Joe Six Pack R can smell Koch brothers all over Jeb, Rubio, Walker and Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

AMAZING that Fox and CNN are trying to manipulate who the presidential candidates are going to be. You push trump in the morning and bush in the evening with a dash of rubio, fiorina and now carson yet hardly report on Cruz who is rising when people hear him.

We know Rubios record on illegal Immigration in Florida , He will lie to your face while trying to get elected. He clearly stated that he would not vote for any type of amnesty and as soon as he made it to Washington he sponsored a bill to flood the country with illegal aliens. America has had it with lying assholes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a Tea Party guy, and when I finally figured out Romneys positions in 2012, they were near perfect. Its a bit late for him to jump in for 2016 now though pity those donors supported Bush and Rubio over Romney back when Romney was actually entertaining a run. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I know Ben Carson is quiet and thats his personality but I want a president who gives the people motivation and makes a nation believe. When George Bush was president he had great vocalization and would really get the people energized and determined. I can see that with like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Chris Christie. I just dont see that with Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope they nominate Rubio. Bernie will crush him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I canr see a Pediatric Surgeon cutting food stamps to destitute families. He may run for the GOP, but Ben Carsons natural empathy would result in a progressive administration with tighter abortion restrictions but fewer drones. Be careful what you wish for.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

No idea why they keep pretending that the founding fathers didnt support illegal immigration. There was no such thing as illegal immigration at the time. The founding fathers completely supported immigration. That doesnt mean we should open the border, but stop using the founding fathers in an argument against illegal immigration. Its a ridiculous claim. The 14th amendment has existed since before any restrictions on immigration. It means exactly what it says. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am really starting to like this man because hes a good man who speaks the truth even if its unpopular with the general public or his own party. I totally respect that. And hes smart and talks with substance. I think he is probably the candidate I would most trust in the role of president, eventhough I dont agree with his more hawkish foriegn policy because I think hes smart, really cares about truth, and has a moral fiber rhan almostno other candidates have. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Holy cow a Republican with common sense. In THIS interview hes actually thinking, not jumping to conclusions and trying to think with a clear mind rather than seeing red i.e. anger. Do not necessarily agree with his tax policy at the end, but he is 100% correct about education. As an independent, I will say there is hope for the Republican side. He almost has my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this nut job thinks we need the mexicans to just come here and go for the american dream!!!!.......WHAT ABOUT AMERICANS AND THERE DREAMS HUH ASSHOLE? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trumps attitude worries me. Hes a crude and shady politician at best.

According to Duckman the majority of americans dont agree with Trumps immigration policy then why is Trump polling 45%in a CNN poll conducted august 1316 2015?Fox news needs to stop conducting themselves like mainstream media or they might lose more viewers Megyn Kelly did enough damage at the last debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

THANK YOU MR. TRUMP!! PLEASE HELP OUR ONCE GREAT COUNTRY. I agree, people like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz should not be citizens of this country. At the very least they should be forced to change their names to something more American. And what about Dr. Carson? We need to seriously consider a Dred Scott like bill so America can be great again. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank you Mr. Trump for bringing the truth to light. All these immigrants have ruined our country.

Hes said in todays news to be attacking Obama on Iran and Cuba. I wont comment on Iran. The issue speaks for itself. But it seem Rubio could drop the Cuba thing. Why? Big business is poised to recapture its place in the Cuban economy it once enjoyed under Fulgencio Batista. And when business Wall Street speaks, everyone listens. So scrap the Cuba thing. Its a done deal, hermano! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Marco Rubio can sit down and shut up! There is nothing he can do to advance the black lives matter movement, he is barely legal his self.

We should also be demanding the emails from other government employees that have used private email servers, and have not released all of their emails.

I ADMIRE A REAL MAN WHO WILL NOT CAVE IN TO HISPANIC VOTES. REPUBLICANS ARE WANTING TO STEAL THE HISPANIC VOTES FROM THE DEMOCRATS. TRUTH IS REPUBLICANS WANT RUBIO TO GET THE NOMINATION TO WIN THOSE HISPANIC VOTES. FUCK THE ILLEGALS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

i dont like right wingers and republicans but my god! finally someone says it! thank you rubio! mexico is getting hammered when its not even mexicans coming over the border anymore, many people from other countries are using mexico as a land bridge to the u.s. but right wing america is to stupid to understand mexicans are not going to the u.s like before, so trump is talking a bunch of horse shit every single time he talks about mexico sending illegals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This guy would beat any democratic . Luckily for the democrats the far rightwing will never let him be the nominee . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
War on women is getting old. How about war on babies? I think that is more appropriate. They have no defense, and theyre being murdered. Its barbaric just like Rubio said! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

AS A Cuban American I am so proud COME on!!!!!!! Hes got my vote!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He forgot to mention that lots of Cubans also cross the borders from Mexico and Canada ILLEGALLY .. And also that they get all the freebees benefits that other foreigners do not get. And yes they get advantage as well and abuse the system too ... Hello SR RUBIO MR BLOND double standard <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is ...mentally challenged? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People always talk about left wing conspiracies, but last night the way they went after trump was clearly a right wing conspiracy! The moderators were put up to this. Can any Republican still cry about Crowley when this goes on in their own party? There is also NO chance that any moderator in the national Presidential debates would levy crude attack after attack against one candidate. Fox has always had an agenda and Trump is clearly not part of that agenda. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump straight up said stop bitching about your feelings there are more important things in this world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Christie, lets keep doing what got us in this pickle in the first place. Go Rand. I agree with you more than any of the others up on that stage. BTW, who really trusts Marco Rubio and these other guys? Go look up their voting records please people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with what Rubio said that in the case of rape why solve a tragedy with death, even if the unborn child doesnt feel pain you cant just quit on a helpless human being without giving it a chance to grow up. I support those people who save the lives of babies at abortion clinics. How is that a bad thing? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does anyone see the irony in that statement? This country needs a brain Not only does Trump not have one larger than a yeast cell, but neither does anyone else in the room. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb pretends he doesnt know that the Real republicans want higher standards too....for their children in privately owned schools but not for everyone. Marco Rubio thinks that he has something to say! He better cool down with that bullsh#t before he finds out that he is a 3rd class citizen and can never be president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
shame on is floridians these 2 bush and rubio are talking for us. the rest of US will think we all are a bunch of ignorant non sensical stupid idiots <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

In other words, Marco Rubio supports rape. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

TRUMP RUBIO CARSON BUSH FORLORINA Yes, Trump the President with Rubio, Carson, Bush and Forlorina as the Vice Presidents. Theres no rule about how many Vie presidents the Nation can have.

If Rubio gets in about all that will happen is kids will go from saying, in the pool, Marco Polo to Marco Rubio. Big deal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The candidates who I really have faith in are Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, and Rand Paul. I would love to see any of them in office! The rest of the Republican field is... No bueno <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im pretty liberal and I disagree with the Republican candidates on a lot of issues. That said, I actually like Fiorina and Rubio. If it came down to Clinton or Sanders vs Fiorina or Rubio, I wouldnt be so disappointed. If any of the others get the Republican nomination ... Id be concerned, to say the least. Im also a bit concerned about Hillary, but thats a different issue altogether. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson would be a great contender for President. However, he is facing an uphill battle because he is black and a Republican. Race will always be an issue in our country. Republicans agree with his point of views, but will never vote for him because of his race and minorities will not vote for him because he is a Republican and he constantly bashes our President who happens to be black. Im just saying what most people think, but will not admit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is an elf !! I mean look those ears! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Am I the only one who felt like throughout the entire debate fox was trying to limit rands air time? He got the lead amount of time on the mic, every Fox News analyst said he lost this argument with Christie, yet everybody outside of Fox News said Rand won. He also wasnt on hannitys show after the debate, when I believe EVERY single other candidate in the debate was <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is the only presidential and realistic candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson, Huckabee and Rubio all did well. Fox and Bret Bair disappoints with opening question aimed a only one guy, with only one answer and for only one reason. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio has done fuck all in his life he basically went from university to politics and has no experience running anything. His water break is the only memorable thing hes ever done. He never says anything remotely interesting just regurgitating whatever the current Republican talking points are. It beggars belief why anyone thinks he is Presidential material. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016, get fukt nerds <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Republicans should support abortions and birth controls so that mean less poor people being born so less welfare money wasted, and the illegals should have abortion too since theyre overbreeding and cause the city to be in poverty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wow im impressed with Trumps tenacity and grit. And its about time we had a funny entertaining president. Maybe that will get more ppl being involved in this countrys political system <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubios ears get bigger and bigger the more he spews nonsense. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He never answered the actual question. That was just a stupid word salad. He attacked Obama, delivered some doom and gloom prophecy and people clapped. Is this really what you want in a leader??? He was asked How he would handle it. Because he has ZERO clue about actual Foreign Policy he couldnt answer that question. You really want this moron near a nuke? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

As the son of immigrants, I fucking love Marcos perspective. He understands living out of entitlement from his parents, despite growing up wealthy. However, like him, I grew up well off in the upper middle class but I have learned so much about the true American Dream and what it means to have genuine integrity just from learning from my parents. Marco Rubio is the man I want in office. He understands things on the basis that I coexist on as well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I heard a report on Fox Special Reports that in Seattle, many who got the raise want to work less hours because they found that 15 an hour cuts them out of Benefits like Welfare and Food Stamps, as well as Section 8 housing.

In the meantime ... we have to pay more when we do business with their employers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Didnt Hillary say they were dead broke before she found a way to to come up with all the illegal funding in her Clinton foundation? I admire Rubio at least he has not cleared his debts with a crooked foundation. I am a independent who voted for Hillary in the California primary. It sure wont happen again! I really like Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am a conservative. I have a problem with Huckabee because he supported the child molester josh duggars. If we want to beat Hillary we have to pull in independents. We can not do that with a hard core conservative. Our best bet is Rubio. They are afraid of him ! He has good values , a great story, it is time to elect a younger man. They have to live in the mess the older generation has made. By the way, I am not young! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

His weight surgery is certainly working! But he is too much of a hothead the media will bait him to slip mouth off again. He is not the best candidate to win the general election, Rubio is. Mike Huckabee can kiss all good bye after defending the child molester on 19 kids! I hope you guys do not bring him back after he loses the primary. He will never get you good ratings again. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Yeah, Rubio is shrewd because he really is running for VP. Kissing up to the Republican establishment is the way to go. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Bill Othe Clown, fucking racist piece of horse shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BS Neither Rubio nor Bush are getting more support than Rand Paul or Cruz. Cooked up polls and propagandists trying to keep the GOP as the establishment wants. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush will pick Marco Rubio as VP. It is a political theater that Rubio is running for President. Rubio will attack everyone who attacks Bush in primary. Isnt that cheating? Ask Rubio if he will be Bushs VP pick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clinton is wasting her money.give it to the needy.Rubio will be president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio IS running for President and hes going to win the nomination and hes going to beat the Clinton machine. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio doesnt have any momentum. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Do they pick people who have no personality on purpose? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fellow Tubers, Sen. Marco RubioRFL would not run for president if the money is not there. His message does not count, which is what he, and others, are saying. Sen. Rubio can not think for himself, obviously, otherwise his message would instantly gain popular support. It is not a message, but funding a lie. It be it, Ronin Kannushi <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio doesnt have a chance in hell in becoming the nominee. All other stations will promote the Republican candidate that has the lowest chance of winning against a Democrat. Thats what they seem to always do. Like Romney, or even McCain. They loved McCain during the primaries, but during the general election, they destroyed him and it was easy because McCain was the wimpiest GOP candidate at the time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great Job <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont vote for Trump,Carson and Cruz. Dont vote for any of them but especially those three. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Amazing, an openly Christian conservative man of science who is not afraid to say what he believes. Can you imagine something like this happening at a time like this. Do you suppose that other people might be willing to speak up now? He doesnt just say what everyone knows. He actually thinks for himself. Wow, how shocking, how dare he? I hope he perseveres and that he is able to make a difference. I think he already has. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Rick Santorum, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, George Pataki, Donald Trump, Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal AND Scott Walker they all running for president.

Dear Republicans, Tea Party, conservatives and fundamentalists Prepare yourselves, you have a minimum of 10 more years of Democrat leadership. Once Hillary declares shell run for president, its all over for you. Barry is witty, uses humor wisely, and speaks so eloquently. This was one of the best state of the union addresses, ever! He sure scored big with his comment I have no more campaigns to run...I know because I won both of them. BOOM <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

God bless Obama. The republican party hatred of him is rooted in racism, pure unadulterated racism, and Id be surprised if they dont try to impeach him. Marco Rubio made a fool of himself when he reacted with such knee jerk reaction to Obamas surprise move on Cuba. I guess hes worried about losing the next election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Blah blah blah. Heres a thought. SAY SOMETHING! All fluff, no substance. If you dont like the ideas that the President has, COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER!

I dont support Trump but if given the choice between Trump and Cruz, Id still pick Trump over Cruz as well as Rubio, Santorum, Bush and Jindal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump will follow Carson into irrelevance and Cruz will too. Its going to be a Kasich Rubio ticket. Ohio and Florida come on people its all about the electoral college not whats best for the people, if it was it would be Bernie Sanders in a landslide. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Have the establishment Republicans and Democrats protected you from radical Islam? 1. Twin Tower bombings 93 2. 911 Islam attacks 01 3. Fort Hood Islam attack 09 4. Boston Marathon Islam attacks 2013. So how can you expect a established Republican or Democrat to protect you? They have not in the past! Hillary wont, Cruz wont, Rubio wont and Bush most certainly will not! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only conservatives can be stupid enough to run a giant fucking asshole in the primary and expect him to garner votes outside the rightwing asshole base. And they equate being an ignorant asshole with being antiPC, like its a badge of honor. As stupid as you thought these people were running Romney four years ago theyve proven theyre ready to top that level of stupidity by running this loudmouth douchebag. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everybody should care about this. Its a very real possibility that this man could become the next president. There are thousands of sheep in America. Thankfully Im British, so Trump becoming president would only have a minor affect on me. If this the man who you really want to run your country? You truly have to question his intelligence and empathy when he does shit like this. Its a shame. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and Carson are on their way out. The establishment GOP has announced theyre launching antikook ads. They wont stand by and let the kooks destroy the GOP brand. Trump will get pissed off and go independent remember Ross Perot?. With a 3way general election....Hillary easily takes all the chips. Teabillies commit suicide. All is good. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Daily reminder that nobody cares about this. Trumps numbers will continue to rise at the same rate that the antiTrump pieces are peddled out by the media. Thankfully, nobody is listening anymore. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That wasnt very nice trump but given your the only one that can make America great I will give you a pass on it!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets see what excuses, his fans say know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Its odd why they would shoot down a russian aircraft when they know they are fighting ISIS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sanders is atheist and socialist. Only 48% of americans would vote for him. The only way he could win is if the democrat coalition turnout outperform the levels of 2008 and 2012. As a conservative, I apreciate Sanders as person, he really believe in his cause, unlike Hillary. I cheer he gets the nomination because it would be a gift to the GOP candidate. Rubio, Kasich, Jeb and Christie would not feel any burn. Trump or Cruz coul get burned. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

When it is clear from the Polls that only 4 out of these 910 candidates ie TRUMP, Carson,RuBio CruZ have the serious chance of winning the race then I do not understand why rest of the others r keep coming continuing when they himself knew that now they cant make it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Rubio and Rand. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It would probably be good if Cruz, Santorum, Rubio and Bush to just drop out and take their donor money with them. Not like they stood a real chance against Trump or Carson for the Republican nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump is starting to work on my nerves. We the American people do not want a fucking clown for a President. I am starting to lean towards voting for Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If I had to pick between Rubio and Cruz Im going Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio does not know the meaning of the world isolationist. He is far more isolationist than Paul, because he favors draconian sanctions and blockades. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio does not understand how business works. And he wants to be President maybe just like Obama who has not had business savvy either as evidenced by the most recent Iran deal quarterbacked by John Kerry. Rubio has no clue that filing bankrupt on a business is not the same as filing personal. I like Rubio but hes still a kid.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
just in case everyone doesnt understand what Marco Rubio is doing he is intentionally muddying the waters to make it tougher for the voting constituencies to be able to tell the difference between himself and Ted Cruz but as I said we all know whos the conservative and who is the liberal Republican Marco Rubio is jeb Bushs boy hes his conservative blocker <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is a liar and a moderate Republican at best I think we all know the true conservative its Ted Cruz Ted Cruz 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
once again CNN you have failed to surprise me by having a liberal Democrat like good old rat face. Rat face will be a big fan of Marco Rubio the reason she is a supporter of Hillary Clinton she knows that Marco Rubio will be easily beaten by Hillary Clinton Ted Cruz will be much much tougher for Hillary to beat so she will support Marco Rubio as the easier candidate to be and suggests that Ted Cruz is a crazy whack job whos going to kill us all <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio in Cruz agree on legal immigration. also Rubio seeing the mood of the voter is trying to be more like Cruz not the other way around Rubio is the new standard bearer for the moderates now that Jeb Bush is no longer viable as a presidential candidate. the truth is if you want to Linguinis find moderate to liberal Republican Marco Rubios your man if you want a hardcore real conservative Ted Cruz your man Ted Cruz 2016 Ted Cruz. Org Ted Cruz. org <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is right about welders making more than philosophy majors Im a welder I make 93,000 dollars a year........so cnn check your facts bullshit news organization.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CRUZ, CARSON, and RUBIO are Israel firster far right AIPAC JSTREET puppets. Ru Paul is PRO TPP. CARSON is out of his mind. Not an ounce of sincerity from all of them combined. Just vacant slogans from corporate whores. Shallow and corrupt. Grotesque. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
PAUL REPRESENTS REAL CONSERVATISM. Rubios a fake, cultural conservative telling us that Radical Jihadist in the Middle East require us to DESTROY THE CURRENCY WITH DEBT. And no, Rubio, youre the isolationist who wont talk or trade with Cuba, Russia, and China. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only in people that have a chance against Hilary is Trump, Carson and Rubio Why? because they are exciting and US likes that. If Paul, Cruz or Kasich get the nomination you might as well give the presidency to Hilary Clinton because they dont stand a blue chance in hell to beat Hilary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Manipulation reporting. Trump never said Operation wetback. Only Cnn would distort the true facts to brain wash peoples opinions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets be real the only ones that has a chance against Hilary has to be exciting or charismatic. Americans like that, they dont like boring and the same song and dance. Their are only 3 candidates in Republican party that have a slight chance. They are Carson, Rubio and Trump and even against Hilary they will all be underdogs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

notice, when Rubio is cornered he starts acting up with emotional fears, but he didnt answer Rands questions... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
scrolling down the comments, everyone seems to be amazed with Paul. Unlike the media, theyre determined Rubio came out the victor from all... how biased and false... Im positive Rand is gonna have a knockout when election nears <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is an empty suit like Obama. He has done nothing. A welfare plan that gives more money to low income families who keep pumping out children sounds more like a democratic tax plan than a conservative one. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio sounds like an overly emotional woman. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Holy cow, I just read the article that I referred to earlier. The two Pinocchio that were granted in regards to Hilarys lie were for Rubio, for his Statement that Hilary lied. .

Voting for Rand Paul in the primaries and suggest you all do the same. We already have the strongest military in the world, both strategically and tactically and can annihilate the planet THOUSANDS of times over DO NOT let the masters of war who only seek to line their pockets scare you into spending us further into oblivion!

It will probably take another World War to get this fucked up nation straightened up. God bless America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
According to Rubio, deporting 11 million Hispanic ILLEGALS DOESNT MAKE NO SENSE. What hes really saying is that letting all ILLEGALS stay makes perfect sense.

Fair enough, Rand. But if you get to claim that Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton share the same neoconservative philosophy, then its fair game to to point out that Rand Paul and Ron Paul share the same neoConfederate philosophy and isolationist impulse. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this pot smoking millennial iraq veteran is supporting paul Im no teabag get and am quite educated and Im an agnostic person, we should vote on the bases of who would do the best on the majority of issues not who is the best on single issues <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, at least we now know why Rubio wants to be President of the USA. He needs the money. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why do I feel like Rubio is getting a check from American Express for this publicity. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i cannot trust Rubio because some of his policies are similar to s Obamas agenda. I did not see Rubio to call mitch Mconnel a liar. You failed to stick up for the American people and let Obama get his own way. He is a puppet and he should not be trusted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Until recently, I was blind to mainstream media bias that exists in America. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were right. Thank you CNN and thank you Politico for exposing your true colors to us. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if this fucking idiot cant even take care of his finances, then how the fuck is he going to take care of americas finances?? he would make a terrible president for many reasons. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If youre black and not a liberal, this happens. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fiorina has that vocal fry thing going around these days highly annoying. Also, we mock the men too Trumps hair, Rubios dry mouth and elephant ears, Cruzs melting face, etc. If woman want to get in the ring, they also have to be ready to take a few hits and roll with it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben putting the media in their place! Holy shit i love this guy!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson Great for President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes having a meltdown lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He will never be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is done. Either Trump, Cruz, or Rubio now. My bet is on Trump winning the nomination and then losing the election in an absolutely abysmal defeat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is pretty much guaranteeing a Republican win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One RINO Trump, two moderate republicans who would fold under pressure Carson and Rubio and one candidate who advocates capitalism, rejects the fake oldNazi dogma about a behavioral gene, and exposed Sierra Clubs global warming arguments as a fraud Ted Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
republicans are racist <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Another crazy bought out politician . And your a fucking lunatic if you think Fox News is news . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im so tired of gotcha journalism. CNN gave Obama a pass. They never scrutinized his record. They worshipped him. But not a Republican like Carson. They make me sick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is a joke. Answer a single simple question. Dude is so full of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He was the one misbehaving . Why would he be exposing them ? As people start to look more closely at the candidates we will see more and more cracks in their armour .This is a good thing .Example We now know that Rubio cant look after his own finances . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
nice try rubio...come back and run when you are 30 years older <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Holy crap that adds up to 225.68 !! I wonder if he can pay it back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How can a seemingly bright, fairly young fellow like Mr. Rubio have his head up his ass about the environment? I am not surprised at the other denying Republican tools, but I thought Rubio might be more intelligent and honest. Apparently he will suck the big donorbig corporation tit and ignore the threat to our grandchildren just like the others. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is CoSponsor of the prooutsourcing Isquared bill that would send thousands of US jobs to India. He would triple the number of H1B visas used to bring in Indian workers who are then trained by the American workers they are replacing. The American worker is then laid off and the foreign worker goes back to India, taking the job with him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald trump is a pure and utter jackass. The guy has not got a clue. He attracts big crowds because he is a clown. Looking at this from Ireland, and he is giving us great laughs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah, it will resonate like a fly trapped underneath a glass container buzzz ping! buzzz ping! Buzzzz ping!!!!!!! Marco Buzzz ping! Rubio. lol ffs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio seems a nice guy but he is not what we need. Trump or Carson for me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is a liberal tool for CNN. Always trying to discredit Donald Trump and never criticizes the other candidates. There is nothing Donald Trump has stated that isnt true about the other candidates. The corrupt media is on the attack and the people need to wake up to their lies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Terrible moderator. Trump trump trump Rubio Rubio. Atleast Jeb praised Rand <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ford was a moron.... in the great republican tradition like Reagan, Dan Quayle, Sarah Palin, George W Bush, Huckabee, Michelle Bachmann, Scott Wallace, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz, etc. etc. shit there are too many to name <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mitt Romney has now been proven to be right about this country and Russia.I like Romney however we have others who are running that will beat Hillary like , Rubio, Trump and Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How did Rubio get the better of anyone? I watched the debate and found absolutely nothing Rubio said to be even remotely appealing. He just seems like a huge phony. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I can confirm that no republican will ever be elected president again. They cant keep up with social trends and new generation. Its all over for them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I used to like trump but lately hes been an idiot. I vote ben carson for president or rubio. the only thing I agree on trump is we are being led by idiots. Obama is a fucking moron same with his administration <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump protesters all need to put weights in their pockets and walk into the ocean. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Carson, Trump, Rubio, Bush, or Fiorina were the repub nominee then Hillary will be president. And im ok with that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Super pacs try to destroy Trump. It will be very hard but if they succeed, you know who will be next ? Carson and that will be much easier. When theyre done with him, they put their establishment candidate like Rubio. So lets do everything possible not to let it happen. Keep the good work ladies and gentlemen!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I saw this poll on RealClearPolitics. Only 400 were polled for this. I dont believe it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For polling purposes, they must have found the same 1000 Ritalin addicts who change their minds every 10 seconds. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
George HW Bush in 1990 started a war and we went into a recession with high unemployment numbers.., Bush Jr. another war and a great recession which is still not fully recovered after 8 years.. I cant say anything good about Obama neither.. But brother Bush wants to Fix It? The Bushes are known for destroying the economy and starting wars.. We sure as hell dont need another BUSH.. Us middle class cant afford this guy... Id rather see Trump, Clinton, or Rubio... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its all going according to plan. Trump and Carson will exit. Jeb will save us from Rubio. Who the hell is Rand Paul? Jeb has us right where he wants us. The only thing missing is Dan Rather. He is missing, I hope. I dont watch TV, so I dont know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bullshit memorized answers from Bush and Rubio. Trump is being practical. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is the only presidential candidate that knows what its all about out there. The rest are a bunch of spoiled na brats. Im voting for Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And these crying bitch republicans are the ones who claim they will be tough on China and Russia! You cant even handle simple truthful questions about your shitty record here at home! Putin will eat you alive you sad pathetic losers, now you want to ban media and censor questions you dont like? GOP is party of LOSERS! go cry all you like... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubio is a libtard. he should be running as a democratic party candidate. thats why soo many democrapslibtards like rubio and thats why some democrapslibtards prefer rubio over their democratic party candidates. the only reason why rubio ran as a republican for the senate was because most of the floridians are neoconservatives. the establishment is libtard. NEOconservatives are more libtard than conservative. NEOconservatives are slightly to the right libtards. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Your a vile bush, thats why your nazi NWO ask isnt wanted.. None of them are mainstream left or right... they are all satanic Luciferian puppet minions... IN MY OPINION <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio? Really? Trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
GOP is going to implode I need some popcorn <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio big debate performance? It was ok at best in a field of corporatists. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thanks for clearing things up John.. Youre still no conservative!!! After hearing what you said about CNBC pretty much made it clear to me youre a RINO. For those that are still on the fence with this guy, this might make things a little more clearer for you.. Heres what he told Fox News.. CNBC Debate moderators were fine, everybodys criticizing them, I thought they did fine Kasich Sincerely, Wake up People <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
MARCO RUBIO WINS! FATALITY <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
El Chapo Rubio will open up the borders even more than Obama. Listen to his speeches from a year ago. He is only talking tough now because he is lying to his base to get the nomination. TrumpCarson 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even Rubio and Trump looked like that was too much bullshit for even them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bush is saying the truth about Rubio. if Rubio is not doing his job in congress, why he is running for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is such a pussy turning on Rubio to score points. Look at him all sweaty and desperate, just like Nixon was in his debates <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is too short to be president. Maybe he could do something in a Wizard of Oz remake. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He should have presented Rubio with Antonio L de Santa Annas fake leg. The cork leg is displayed at the Illinois State Military Museum in Springfield, Illinois. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Haha, Rubio bitchslapped him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im ready to buy some Mannatech vitamins! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump idiot and liar Hillary LIAR Huckabee Fraud Carson doesnt know what he talks about Rubio all words and appearance The fat guy fraud Paul somewhat of the truth but still is sipping on that koolade. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if you can continue the 2nd video you will see that RUBIO talks about the CONTROL in the Mainstream Media <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Speaking for an hour which is all hes allowed in this instance regarding the budget deal isnt a fillibuster its just a cheap campaign stunt aimed at drumming up donations from ignorant rubes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio only cares about himself and maybe his mother, and does not care about other Americans. He understands shell be well provided for if he becomes president. But its not going to happen. Hes not very smart. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz and Trump and Christie and Rubio tore the libtarded moderators a new one. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ill votr. rubio... ill he win probably not <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Funny he never said there shouldnt be a cap on Social Security and Medicare. Why are the mega rich contributing at the same rate of someone who is middle class? Why stop contributing after youve made over 150K when they are making 10 million or more. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck all the haters, I will always be proud of the people I belong. Good luck on the journey brother Rubio, dont hate on Cuba and Venezuela. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wrong!! The website attacks RUBIO, not Zuckerberg! Omg the fact checker needs fact checking <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media needs to do a better job at not falling for Donald Trumps bull shit. Seriously, he was critical of Rubio right in his OWN WEBSITE and blatantly lies infront of millions of people that he wasnt critical . This is pathetic. Stop sucking up to this ass wipe of a candidate just because his name gives you better ratings. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubios missed votes record is 12.3 percent missed votes...Obamas missed vote record was 24.3 percent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the funny part is Rubio has no chance in hell of being the president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No one questioned Obama when he was awol as senator. Why does Rubio get different treatment....maybe because he is Hispanic? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont understand what the GOP sees in this guy. Is it just because hes Latino and from Florida? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Bible promise that God is going to bring to ruin those ruining the earth... Revelation 1118. Our hearts ache because of this senseless slaughter but in the end the wicked are going to come to their end.

Didnt look confident, Rubio.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is full of shit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is really a nice person. But he did not talk about how he will bring jobs back to USA and how to fix huge trade deficit issue. Thats the only thing I really care about. Hope he can talk about that next time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
cnn try to demonize family business HUH? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

great move of jeb bush to turn his guns on ted cruz it was glorious and changed my opinion on jeb!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio you suck. We know it and you know it .. just throw in the damn towel son. Your established party is no longer doable .. we dont want you and never will again once this country becomes America again we will see that the esablishment did nothing but hold this country back from its greatness. FUK the NWO and FUK anyone that supports it! AMERICA DO OR DIE!!! HOORAH!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is just how corrupt the MSM is. On the whole of all polls Rubio is not even close to a rise ... I rest my case. Theyre just scared shiit of Trump because he is a true American and not part of the corrupt mediagov establishment ... On the rise my ass! STFU ... I hope the first thing Trump does as president is shut this corrupt CNN down for good! Along with all the others! Time reporters start doing what they should be doing. Reporting TRUTH!!! Not LIES!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio does put a good point out, except, why wouldnt he show up and vote on each issue, his vote could be the one that makes or breaks an issue. Our taxes pay for these Politicians and they dont work 40 weeks a year, whats so hard about showing up for at least 90% of the votes? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio in the early stages of a comb over someday hell look like Julio Down by the Schoolyard <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio reminds me of the weird kid who lived down the street <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Rubio has stop representing his district <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is he really using his troubled teenage years to prove he is tough? Dude keep that to yourself or people might start thinking thats why you look so out of it all the time. Did they give you a lobotomy to calm your crazy ass? <#urls:0> <+emoji:3> <-emoji:0>
Rubios campaigning like a liberal talking about how hes new, and will be a different type of candidate, but in fact hes one the the most ultraconservative, outdated politicians. Hes as conservative as Scott Walker, especially on economic issues. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is super lowenergy and boring. Representative for the drug companies. Pro mandatory vaccinations, anti marijuana. No way he gets elected. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LOL, CNN trying to use a Trump headline to get likes for Rubio. Nice try! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For everyone who didnt really understand what Marco Rubio said? Ill elaborate... What he ACTUALLY SAID IS? My Dog Ate My Homework... Thats why I dont have it... Yep... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie sander 2016 fuck trump and Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No democrat thinks Rubio is scary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am ashamed at Rubio. He fails terribly at representating the Hispanic community. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really hope Donald Trump wins the Republican Nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If rubio dropped out his poll numbers would go to bush. Bush would somehow win then Rubio would be bushes VP nominee <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Rubio is elected president he might actually beat GWB in the number of days vacation he takes. GWB took a total of 879 days vacation. GWB, his first year in office, he took a month long vacation before 911. GWB was on vacation when Hurricane Katrina struck. This is what youre going to get with Rubio, Jeb Bush, and maybe Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton was back on the campaign trail the next day after her 11hour Benghazi testimony. Thats commitment. Hillary Clinton 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I rather Carson than Rubio <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
we cant have rubio as president cant happen <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No freaking way. Ben Carson is gonna win not Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kasich 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would like to see a Carson Rubio or Trump Rubio ticket. I think hes a little too young for president but I also think hes incredibly smart and well versed in todays politics and could bring balance and stability to either of these frontrunners. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr.Carson is a good man I would vote for him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No good. Carson doesnt have the goods to get elected in the general. No way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is fuckin liar. He is clapping, while against immigrants <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is old as dirt and looks like hes about to take a fucking nap. #MarcoRubio2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is crushing Rubio Bush in their home state. Kristy is not even a blip on the screen compared to Trump in his home state. What is Mitt Romney even saying? Such horse shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We can laugh at ourselves so CNN is the media arm of the DNC. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What about Ben Carson? Cough cough. Haha!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Remember CNN is pro Hillary, so they want to prop up the Republican candidate they feel would be demolished by her. Which of course is Trump. In actuality, CarsonRubioCruz are probably much closer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trumps a lot of fun, and I support him for upholding the nations laws and fighting the tyranny of the Left, but Rubios speech was genuinely hearttouching, and I really wish the best for the guy. I can relate. My grandparents floated to this country from Haiti and Curacao on a door, respectively, and theyre the staunchest conservatives I ever knew. If it werent for the Left using welfare schemes to impoverish immigrants and make them dependents, none of this would be necessary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a man and I stand for womens rights and womens right to choose their decision for their health and Hillary is the best for the job in supporting women so #Hillary2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Also anyone else like how bernie smiles when he shakes killarys hand and then once he lets go he turns serious. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Unlike Republicans, Bernie can attack Hillary based on her policies, not her emails or BENGHAZI. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, Rubio has a point.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
does Rubio ever have any evidence to support his points other than a personal anecdote? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Concerning his missed votes, Rubio he says the votes will not make a difference unless we have a new president and that is why hes running?,,, eea gad. And Christie will not only continue our police state surveillance programs but make them bigger. The worst thing is both of these yo yos will have us back at war in the Middle east within 1 yr. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio would surely beat Hillary in a general election. But he wouldnt beat Bernie Sanders. The democrats cant afford to nominate Hillary. She would hand over the election to the republicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To me..personally...the perfect candidate is one with Obamas views, but Marco Rubios military mentality. ..John Kasich is surprisingly close to fitting that bill <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
McCain, Hillary and Rubio are insane. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Smack down of epic proportions. I like Carson, and will vote for him if hes the Republican nominee. And while I am more of a Rubio guy, its good to see Carson push back like that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doctor Carson is an amazing, intelligent, honest and fearless individual. I think hes a fantastik person in every sense of the word but in all honesty, Id rather see him as VP for a president Rubio or Jeb Bush. I may seem blunt...but after almost 8 years of this Obamanation Abomination in the White House, I would not like to see another A.A. prez right now. Nobama has spoilt it for me. I know I may get backlash for this comment but I thats how I feel right now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If President Obama were white, these same people would be his biggest supporters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I get it. Obama is black, yet ignores race relations. Wolf is trying to box Ben in and Im impressed in how he wont take the bait. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio sweats too much and Jeb is a wimp.....Go Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont like Trump, but I certainly dont like Sanders... Rubio fp! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a Kid, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Someone in the United States wants to make the nofly zone over Russia? Marco Rubio for example! Come on! American nation is ready to total destruction of American cities with use nuclear weapons? ON Washington as ON Berlin !!!? And this is not Putin! This is the great the will the Russian nation.The will destroy the German Fascism. AntiHitler coalition against the United States and USAISIS? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a true idiot. If his wife and daughter fall victim to any type of sexual crime I want him to stand behind his comments. Rubio is a clueless patsy supported by his corrupt constituents. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a fucking con who want our borders wide open so his cousin Consuela and Miguel can come here and mooch the system. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

republican lack of good candidate to offer to the voters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio needs water. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah there is some contraction... Dont forget that Bush and Walker were once the top 3 by big numbers, and Trump was near these numbers. Wait until Rubio and Fiorina start to plummet and until some of these idiots drop out... Donald Trump will stay in the lead by a big margin, because he has a lot of voters its as simple as that <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
SO is Donald trump making fun of Rubio for being poor and humble? Not everyone had a rich daddy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Still voting Trump 2016 !!! Women have done nothing to change Selective Service and until they change that they should not acquire Presidency. Rubio is just weak. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush is just the most hilarious person ever. Hes bound to loose the primaries so his goal now is to take Rubio down with him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I must admit that Rubio always kind of struck me as a cross between BatBoy from The Weekly World News and The Beaver from Leave it to Beaver. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i cant wait to see that clown give up and leave with his tail between his legs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Keep Rubio out of California he might drink all the water and sweat it out. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio has my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is the Republican Obama. Articulate, intelligent, excellent in debates and from the stump, even a tad charismatic. Very talented. But also very young without any notable executive experience, oversimplifying the world to fit his rhetoric, with a tendency to get aroused by his own words.He should run something first, prove himself as a leader, and come back in 10 years. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what indicates that he cant take criticism? hes criticising bush and rubio. jeb! is clearly having issues with it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
GO TRUMP! What a rational calm cool approach. So much better than the traditional neo cons like Rubio and Fiorina. I like him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im really not seeing a reasonable, down to EARTH candidate in DONALD TRUMP. Rand Paul, Rubio, even JEB would be better, sorry DONALD, youre a great businessman and entertainer, but we cant use you right now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
screw rubio, he loves to give our money to foreign aid, hes a dam war monger and punk bitch, he acts like a cop, an assholle, he supports the most evil greedy and violent hated country ISRAEL, I am a high information person but this is the first election I will participate in, Im 48 years old, GO TRUMP. if anyone other then trump gets nomination, I will vote democrat just because its rigged by special interest donors, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont attack ads constitute insulting your way to the white house? Trump is the only one not allowed to insult. Bill and every one else whining about Trump should just shut the fuck up until Hillary can say Trumps name without mentioning his hair! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Senator Rubio! Preach It! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youre a peasant lady. You got no right to talk to Fiorina that way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This man has INTEGRITY something that is so lacking in Washington DC. HE is a man of immense character and would make a TREMENDOUS President. I truly hope America wakes up and makes the right choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh god, hes starting to take himself seriously! Hes going to be in for a rude awakening... Hes already got crowds booing him and his polling numbers are falling. I dont think hell take it well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its either Trump, Bush or Rubio. I dont see anyone else getting the support they need to win the nomination. I dont think anyone is interested in another Bush presidency. Rubio is a smart guy, but hes really hyper and young and it shows. I think, unless some craziness happens at the upcoming debates, Trump will win the nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio sweats a lot for a young man......Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
most people who dont like Obama are predjudice and have a mental and emotional complex about difference of race. They may as well have a complex about a box of crayon. They attack the messenger because this message is quite humane. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben fell apart at the first sign of someone pressing him on his views and not letting him get away with the usual bullshit answers so his staffer angrily ended it. How dare you ask my client real questions?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just give up your right winged christian extremist. Your values have lost and liberalism have von. Sry you will be part of history in the same catagori like the dark age or the nazis. The republicans will never be able to win an election again and even though their is no god i would like to say thank god than Bernie Sanders will be president 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
since scott walker dropped out of the race... hes not far behind... next will marco rubio... TRUMP2016...!!!! GOOOO TRUMP!...GIVEEM HELL TRUMP!!...GO TRUMP!...GO TRUMP!..GO TRUMP!... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wake up america, this morally bankrupt buffoon, is mad fox news, bc one their guests said carly fiorina cut his balls off, and here hes calling rubio a clown <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Boner and Rubio cried because they know the Pope is here to fight the republican agenda of hate which has been going on lately. The chump and his agenda is the worst thing that could happen to the world bunch of self serving assholes him and his supporters are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People .......................what have the republicans and democrats done for you in the last 15 years? Wars,deficits, dream act,executive order for amnesty, worldwide recession, ISIS, China and Russia taking over ect! And you want to vote for establishment Rubio and establishmentbacked Carly who abandoned the teaparty in 2010 because she did not believe in them and and attacked Boxer on her looks! And dont let me get started on Clinton or Sanders! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio or Carly.I cant make up my mind <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The ESTABLISHMENT is doing everything possible to knock Trump out of the race. They know he cant be bought. They know he represents real change and with that change the dismantling of the crime syndicate BOTH parties have put in place in Washington DC.! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
do not think Boehner and Rubio cry when watching them homeless who struggle everyday, make a report about them CNN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb lost the votes of 40 million parents, but won the votes of their kids. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio comes across as just wanting to win for the sake of winning but I can tell if in office he would be totally different <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Something is just very dishonest and sleezy about Rubio <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio should off himself and his stories of plight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio and theory no this is who the Democrats want to run against so this is the reason why these people are the people in the lead in their poles they would also enjoy other week rhinos like Donald Trump or Jeb Bush easily beaten by literally any Democrat that ran against them <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
once again CNN trying to create the narrative with their push polls the suggestion that walkers bad and Rubio Bushs conservative blocker is good what experience does Marco Rubio even have and if the one of the real conservative Latino they would obviously pick Ted Cruz but the Liberals fear Ted Cruz too much so create the moderate we need never going to win Rubio. Rubio just like Jeff is a rhino <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is dangerous? People who use language like that are dangerous. Uber leftist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I support Trump, however Rubio did give a compelling answer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I completely understand Fiorinas rise, but Rubios??? Really? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a democrat but people in the republican party if any of your candidates do win LET IT NOT BE TRUMP. prefer rubio but im voting for Hillary but if a republican has to win it should be rubio. GO HILLARY <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

One thing I know this interview actually made CNN look bad and Ben Carson look good. Carson for President!!! With Rubio, Cruz or Fiorina as a running mate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio and his stupid nostalgic stories. Donald should punch him in the nose, then he could reminisce. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Marco Rubio seems to be so nervous all the time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio won that debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Senator Rubio sounds just like a funny clown imported from abroad. Please Note This is just a personal opinion and others could have different point of view <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow, Rubio is really fucked up <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Why is Rubio always drinking water??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Meanwhile he couldnt speak a lick of policy or how to do the job hes running for. Maybe he can run for our countrys mascot and put everyone down, but the big guy making the decisions? Im a liberal but Id say Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio you are eloquent, a great speaker, intelligent among other things maybe but a jokester you aint. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CNN moderated the debate exactly like you would expect. Ignorant questions, and trying to pit one contender against the other so that no real policy discussions could be had. Trump and Bush were dumb enough to fall into their trap but the real winners, Rubio, Cruz, and Fiorina werent. Good for them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio AIPAC puppet <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is the only reasonable one on the stage. Fuck Rubio, Fuck Bush, Fuck Chris Christie, and Trump is a FOOL!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why the fuck do all the repubs need to be barbaric pious morons? Im a libertarian, but Bernie seems to be the only reasonable choice this term. goddamn I hate this country. also why the hell isnt discussion of the national debt more prominent? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Last night was a show of a bunch of monkeys trying to BS us. You could tell by their expressions they didnt mean a word of what they were saying. You know these guys hang out with each other when we are not looking. Like Christie and Rubio hang out at Romneys home in Marthas Vineyard. Its all one big club, and you arent in it. Youtube george carlin best 3 minutes then watch the video to see what Im talking about. Thank God for Bernie Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love how the media is playing up Fiorina and Rubio like crazy. Trump killed this debate. He was under fire the entire night from every candidate on stage, yet held his own very well without losing his cool or committing any major gaffes. Trump won the Drudge poll by 60%. The media hates Trump and will do anything to see him lose, but the people know who really won the debate. TRUMP IN 2016!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so who do you think was the winner? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not a fan of any them, but Cruz, Walker and Rubio make me cringe. Theyre so phony. Everything they say sounds rehearsed. No one even bothers to mock them by imitating them like they do Trump because they do a good enough job of that themselves. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stupid shit ever. What the fuck happened to the stun gun ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She cant run any of my companies LMAO..Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fiorina was fantastic. She won this debate easily.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The people who stood out in this debate are Carly, Rubio Paul. When debate started to be about health care, foreign policy, and economic policy Trump was no where to be found. When CNN wanted a good joke they went to the girl fight between Trup Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is the only rational person on that stage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP LOST THE DEBATE. He ended looking like a demagogue and an airhead at the same time. By the way, how can a ludopathy spreader become a presidential candidate? lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump was on Fire ! He amazed me i thought he was just this sick fuck that we should Elect because we given every other ScumBag a Shot Democrat and Republican . Carly did good for herself she wants to kill Bad Mother Fuckers .Rubio was good but his twitching Scares Me I will still Stand Strong for Ted Cruz Donald Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its a shame the male chauvinists at CNN would refuse Fiorina equal opportunity. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No plans from the Republicans., just pointing the finger. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank you Donald Trump, for speaking english and common sense, not a foreign language or common core.

dile Rubio Y a predicar la verdad <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I believe Mr. Rubio was the one that spoke better than anyone , including Trump. Atacking Bush s wife was uncalled for becuase she was born in Mexico. Trumps wife and ex wife came from another country and no one said anything about. Trump is a man that knows how and when to say things to benefit him. But he has a very good chance of winning the nomination , becuase He has money and power. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
am i the only one ho notice the obvious rigged crowd ? Sure Trump is an idiot but 30 percent of reps vote for him yet its dead silence everytime he speaks <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im an issues guy. Go to berniesanders.comissues Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Hillary, etc. also have web pages that describe what they feel the important issues are. So far Im with Bernie. He wants to end NAFTA, stop the TPP, stop big banks from gambling with our money, stop trading in derivatives, increase social security, bring that 2.5 trillion dollars home from large corporations who are hiding the money to avoid taxes. Geeze there is so much common sense stuff coming from Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a Trump supporter, I have to say Im very disappointed in Trump on this issue. Trump dropped the ball here. Watch Huckabees numbers jump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Can someone give Rubio and Bush a few ahha questions? They act so knowledgeable yet prattle on about their opinions. Lets hear some facts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump needs a minority as vp asap! Rubio or carson! Though it is too soon <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

When I watch Secular Talk and TYT Network they report real news.. then I go to one of the big guys, CNN, and theyre fuckin making a video on Marco Rubio throwing a football at a kid. Really?? Really??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In Rubios Defense? THE KID COULDNT CATCH!!! The Kid Must be The Product of a Single Parent Family... If Rubio had threw that ball any softer? He would have just handed it to the Kid... Which looking at how the kid catches? WOULD HAVE DROPPED IT ANYWAY!!! Lets face it people... SPORTS? IS NOT IN THAT KIDS FUTURE... Especially Sports that require CATCHING A FREEKEN BALL!!! AAAAAHHHHH!!! LOLOLOLOL!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Honestly, I am no fan of Rubio, but this is lame! Go after his policies. This is NOT news worthy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Republicans know that without Trump there is no party. The others do not know what to say without copying what he says. Rubio even used his slogan. I was worried that the people would be swayed, but now I have faith after seeing post debate polls where he annihilated the others. We cant wait for Trump to go to Washington to say, OBAMA.....YOURE FIRED!. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope the new president hopefully marco rubio realizes whats going on with the justice system, how it needs to be fixed, less criminal charges on teens, everything needs to be fixed <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Deny it all you want you murderous feminist SJW women and your white knights, but Rubio does have a valid point. If its not a human life at conception, then what it is? It took me a while to figure it out too, but all I could come up with was a BABY in nine months time! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If he sees life as sacred then why does he support the Death Penalty and why does he support going to War? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio arguing to give 2nd Amendment rights to unborn fetuses. Rubio is an idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Faith is inferior to facts, Rubio, and the fact is that a single celled zygote should not be afforded the same rights as the woman who just got raped. It would be akin to believing that sperm should be protected under the law. Sperm are living one celled organisms too with human DNA. So are Ovums. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio can feel as strongly as he likes about when life begins. Given how passionately he opposes abortion, I hope he never has one. But he will NOT shove his crucifix up a womans uterus! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wtf who would vote for this garbage mother fucker , he doesnt give a fuck about the people who are alive , let a lone a sperm cell !! He is a murder when he jacks off or when he get his dick sucked! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder why Rubio and his republicans, dont mind sending living people, to other countries to kill or be killed. Or when they give an actual living person, a death sentence. If life is life, then black life matters. Unborn baby life matters. That crazy white boy, who killed all those people in that theatre, his life matters too. This is the 21st century. We better start acting like it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr Rubio please respect seperation of church and state. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Should have asked Rubio to site his scientific sources that confirm his idea based on faith that life begins at conception. Missed your chance there Chris. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I want to personally thank rubio for making his stance clear that if his wife or daughter were raped or victims of incest he would make the woman carry that inside her for a full term....He can never win the election....Sick religious zealot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Your faith shouldnt influence American policy though lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marcos Rubio lost that argument ... big time. The president of the United States should embrace any kind of faith ... including the lack of it ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So hypocritical! The value of life is timeless... Unless youre GAY,Black, or poor!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Now candiadates running alongside Rubio has to declare that life begins at erection. Its a race on whos the craziest to appease the GOP base! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Like Rubio, Jindal, Fionia, and Carson? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is the best LEADER running, and an impartial study will show he really does have the best, most well thought out plan for the USA he might not have Trumps money or TV connections, but he can win with grassroots support the primaries and primary debates will be critical, based on his record and his platform, Senator Paul has got my vote in the primaries. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This black guy is a moron, Rubio is a real candidate unlike Trump? Fucking moron <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does the media think Clinton has it locked? They never mention Bernie Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a European I would have to agree.. Europe is wealthy and powerful enough to solve regional affairs without foreign intervention. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillarys trapped in the past? Really? Rubio, look at your position on gay marriage, abortion, taxes, social welfare programs. In each of those positions its a return back to life in the 1940s! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This rates right up there with Rubio and his boat. Pathetic journalism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is the wrong guy. Is just part of the stablishment trying to push the same global economy that is destroying the world. In other words is part of the global mafia as Hillary and Bush. The good candidates are Rubio, Paul or Carlson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Jews ought to be offended by this callous and brainless pandering. How low can these candidates sink? So far Santorum, Gulliani, Webb,Cruz,Rubio,Trump and Dr.Brainless have written themselves off my check list.I will not vote for any of these under any circumstance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

every soldier is not a hero. some are assholes. McCain is a schlub of a politician, hes a career politician. Rubio is a twat also. Everyone piling on Trump ....flavor of the month to do so <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with rubio <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio will be moving down in the next poll and Trump up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio you are a aipac sock puppet. Like everyone else whos running. I wish all you Israel first republicans just move to Israel. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is showing that even the GOP is tip toeing around banning the 1st amendment. Disqualified for having his own opinion? If Trump doesnt win in 2016 America is finished. These 3rd worlders are bringing their backwards ideas into our country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio let me say this...YOU SUCK!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is way overrated <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is showing that even the GOP is tip toeing around banning the 1st amendment. Disqualified for having his own opinion? If Trump doesnt win in 2016 America is finished. These 3rd worlders are bringing their backwards ideas into our country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
marco rubio is delusional <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ricky Ricardo,I mean Marco Rubio is another bought and paid for candidate.That being said Trump should apologize to McCain and get back campaigning on issues that matter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sit down Rubio you nobody. You will never be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would never vote for this mother fucker <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

donald trumprob ford 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im loving this shit. Every day that Trump remains the frontrunner is good for Democrats because it diverts attention away from Bush, Rubio and Walker. The longer the media stays focused on Trump, the worse Republicans look to the general public. And heres the best part the GOP base is actually stupid enough to believe that Trump represents conservative values! Amazing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why would anyone want a bigot as a president? Calling mexicans rapists and POW idiots. Seems like a good guy to vote, no wonder US is going down the drain with people voting for guys like him. Why not just vote for Palin? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The ditsy blonde says Marco Rubio because she thinks hes cute. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Smart Latinos are not offended by Trumps comments about Mexican criminals crossing the border illegally. Latinos who are citizens dont want people coming here that will give them a bad image. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump raises some interesting points on immigration and the economy, but at the end of the day, Republicans are going to back a sensible candidate who can beat Hillary such as Rand Paul or Rubio, regardless of what the polls say about Bush and Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
mexicans lazy? mexicans work hard as fuck on my lawn they arent lazy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Trump owned Cooper in this interview!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is really out to get him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ILLEGAL Immigration. Not legal immigration. Keep twisting around, media. Trump may never be president, he may not even have been a good one, but at least he did what everyone hates. He told the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Romney, Rubio JEB get busted in a gay bar. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
110 ...Chris Cristie and Marco Rubio had a slumber party at Romneys? ..... ??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The GOP will not get tens of millions of conservative voters to show up in the general election if they dish out another schmuck like rubio or bush or christie or paul, who reaches out to the illegalalien vermin. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
SUPPORT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION VOTE ROMNEYBUSHRUBIOPERRY 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What it comes down too was Trump wrong or not? Immigration is a significant issue, see how much trouble the EU has with it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
020 a very creditable field? WTF? Chris Christie has a fuckton of controvery of corruption, Dick I mean Rick Perry has had corruption charges thrown on him, Rubio made all these promises to his fellow Latino voters, and then turn on them to appeal more to the base of Republicans, and then Jeb Bush....I mean....Hes a fucking BUSH <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Easy. He says what everyone thinks but is afraid to say. And he does not depend on other peoples money. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN stop trying to fuck up his image.Your trying so hard <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is speaking the truth. The truth hurts and people cant handle it. Go Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

this is exactly why republicans need to open up about gay marriage. if they dont they will lose 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im Mexican American and Donald trump is right .idk about the rapist part.but more than half the illegals coming to the country are fucking criminals and drug dealers. I would agree if they buffed the borders,cuz these dumbasses are making Mexicans look bad <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dear Mexicans and all Latinos, on behalf of the American people, I feel genuinely embarrassed that this man is running for president. Please excuse his blatant ignorance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bullshit polls to make that cocksucker jeb bush and that faggot marco rubio the front runners <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

FOUR PARKING TICKET IN 17 YEARS? My VOTE IS FOR MARCO RUBIO! THE NEW YORK TIME IS PATETIC. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
At least he doesnt butcher babies before they have a chance at life. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is Hillary Clintons THIRD campaign launch! Imagine if Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, or Marco Rubio had to do three campaign launch doovers. Oh how relentlessly the entire liberal media would have attacked them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RUBBER BULLETS?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the focus on Rubios boat, that he purchased with his own money, must had lost traction <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i predict that its gonna be walker rubio vs clinton castro 2016 election but i could be wrong <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Uhhh, Rubio is such a dumbshit. He tries to hide the fact that he is just another bought warmonger but its so obvious. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is the best choice for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please Demorats pick this fool so our Jeb can easily win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary belongs in jail. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And the same people said that they most likely will vote for her. Why? Americans know that Hillary is far from the best but she is 100% better than the Republicans alternatives who are antigay, antiblack, antiLatino, antipoor, antiwomen, antistudents, antieducation, antiimmigrants..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shes STILL gonna be President 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>
If shes the nominee... I wont vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No, not Rubio. No more of these scumbag Washington insiders with their lobbyist, billionaire, and Saudi connections like BushClinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary will definitely get the nomination. And I dont think Republicans have the numbers to win the general election, regardless of who they throw at her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio lied to our face in Florida to get elected , I am an eye witness ! No better than Bill Clinton or Barak Obama ! Fucking Asshole Self Serving Power Hungry Politician is all he is ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Blackburn, like Marco Rubio, doesnt know what the fuck shes talking about when it comes to foreign policy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Let the Patriot Act die. I think to vote for Bernie Sanders, but I think this Rand Paul may be a good second choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
But the Patriot act passed during Bushs administration. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If this guy can pull this off, he is the president that we Americans been waiting for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We here in Nevada are not interested in what the child Rubio has to say...HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES PAT ROBERTSON! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a homophobe. Im catholic too but I support gay marriage. Its called the bible says GOD LOVES EVERYONE. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
AND NOW FOR A DOSE OF REALITY Only Rubio or Rand Paul stands a chance at beating Hillary. All the polls show that she would slaughter Bush by 10% and the others by even more. If the GOP has a shred on intelligence, theyll learn their lesson and not pick another loser like they did in 2012. I am a republican, but Im tired of being fucked with by my party and I swear to god if Rubio or Paul is not on the ticket, Im going to vote for Hillary, just to fuck with them back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is in 1st place CNN. Stop lying. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Luciferian New World Order sure wants Jeb Bush for President to finish.what Barack Obama started. The truth is nobody wants another Bush in the white house or a Hillary Clinton just accept the fact and move on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fags are the haters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marc Rubio is lame. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is actually a good guy. I like him., <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio needs to go back to his major contributors and get better sound bites. America ousted Saddam Hussein and replaced him with ISIS. How else are we going to spend money on America war machine? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand paul and Marco rubio for president and vicepresident <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
IF ONLY YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY VOTED other than the new wave of tumblr feminists that will vote for Hilary regardless of her policies Bernie, you will have my first vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bla bla doesnt matter it will be Clinton in the White House lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So far out of all the GOP running for President, only Marco Rubio has said that he believes that gay people are born that way. He is conservative and smart. Hes not a religious psycho. he could get the nomination if they are looking for someone who can win. But if they are looking for a crazy nominee than Cruz will probably get the nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like rubio for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rough? these are the numbers Bush 17 Walker 12 Paul 11 Rubio 11 lol Pauls only been in a week buhahahhaa you dunces <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BushRubio 2016! They are the ticket that can stop the apocalyptic theocrats and the drown it in a tub antigovt Tea Partiers who are fighting for control of the RNC. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are more like the Rockefeller Republican Party that I want the GOP to return to. Theres nothing wrong with being establishment Republican when the alternative is antiscience religious nuts or insane antigovt libertarians who want to privatize everything from roads to police forces. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder if Marco Rubio owns an iphone.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ANYONE that CHOOSES to be GAY has the RIGHT to do so. However, ... making a CHOICE to do the WRONG THING is NOT a RIGHT. And CHOICES have CONSEQUENCES like gays cant reproduce, they indoctrinate! So, if a society permits its very own demise, WHAT KIND of FREEDOM IS THAT ?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And the vile Bitch whos worth over 100 Million doesnt leave a tip...... The great fighter for the middle class.......UGGG! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is 2 years older than I am he is not for marriage equality Marco Rubio its 2015 not 1865 lets move forward not backward <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im tired of stupid corrupted people running for president fuck the gop <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio has huge ears. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Havent we learned from history that basic human rights are not state issues? Rubio is the candidate of yesterday, or even two centuries ago. States rights! Yeah right. That just means people at local level can oppress minorities, and thats all its ever meant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes a lying bigoted rightwing fascist conservative Koch sucking corporate whore. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio youve inspired me since you became a senator. I too hope to someday be where you are right now. Know this Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He believes marriage is just between 1 man 1 woman?..well mr rubio you just lost my vote sir.too bad you feel that way <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So the America of Yesterday was the America that in the past 8 years expanded gay marriage to more than 30 US states Mr Rubio? Shame on you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont vote for Rubio. He will drink the White House out of water. Lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look at all the racist here who dont want to see the first Hispanic as president of the U.S. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Rubio, as a Hispanic myself I want to see the first Hispanic president, not another white president like Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its Marco Rubios turn to fail miserably in his campaign. Rand Paul has a better chance of winning than this joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a clown Chico <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No mexican in america will vote for this clown <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Marco! Democrats have thoroughly disgraced themselves so much that American had swung right. It would bee good to have a guy whos in the middle like you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio couldnt cut a promo to save his life. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Next President and Vice President Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush and Rubio dont know shit about Latinos. They only know how to pander to rightwing exiled Cubans. Thats the extent of their Latino base. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God bless Mr. Rubio. We need a conservative back in office again. The guy we have there now has no backbone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need a leader for our country again. Something we havent had since George W. Bush left office. All the best Mr. Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubios a PUTZ. He doesnt have a rats ass of a chance to win. Hillary 2016!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He has Giant Hands <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
With respect to the current line of presidential candidates, Ive never even heard of this Marco Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How Republicans have changed in the 21st century. We have clowns like Marco Rubio that think that theyre going to convince the American public to vote for them. Stay in the Senate Marco, dont make a fool out of yourself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Impeach Obama today! I will vote for this guy. Hes a drinker! I like him! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is just a little snotty dweeb...he will never be elected as president....hes just wasting his time trying .... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The next President Of The United States Of America Marco Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really want to hear from Clinton supporters. What would make her a great POTUS... or even a someone decent one? Anyone?..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes! Great news... especially after readinglistening to Clinton supporters drivel over her running for POTUS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio isnt eligible to be president because he isnt a natural born citizen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think it is racism, the democrats have questioned Cruz and Rubio right to run for president, Chris Mathews asked to see Obamas birth certificate but it was never released <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yaall need to quit ripping on ole Hillary,... I hope i look that good when Im 107 years old. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hardly think a piddling speech is needed to stir up bad blood between Cruz and Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go home rubio.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary, you got my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How can a guy that doesnt really care about humanity be president. The only thin this guy really wants is power and be famous. ITS SO OBVIOUS. This way he will go down in history been able to say, I WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Fuck you marco rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well said rand....I remember that lady and yep she had an agenda towards Rand right from the get go. It will be hard for people to attack Rand because he is the most genuine political man Ive ever seen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sorry John but Ted Cruz is not top tier @ColoredSpaces <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I find it funny when Idiots like Rubio and Cruz have to answer questions instead of just spewing rhetoric with impunity they get thirsty...I guess the water helps move the shit out of their throats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like how he talks to her like shes the stupid one lol the irony <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ill never vote for a Canadian <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio Running for what? As the saying goes... A Fool and his Money is soon Parted... LOLOLOLOL!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Am I the only one that was hoping for a Rick Rubio video?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is such a POS. He couldnt congratulate Islamist thugs like Mursi, Rohani and Erdogan fast enough but he had to literally be forced to get on the phone with Netanyahu, the only democratic leader in the Middle East. Marco Rubio was dead on with his speech! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I understand we shouldnt always vote Dem but to say to vote Rep? He has to be a fuckin idiot. Dems are just the lesser of the two evils. Dont say vote Rep, say we need more options dickhead. Obviously the GOP paid you off to become one of their House Negros aka bottom bitch. Any Black person that follows your ignorant rhetoric deserves exactly what the outcome will be. How about we look at more independent Candidates instead? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubios military service zilch, but he is willing to defend Israel at all costs, provided he doesnt have to foot the bill. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio should try that line about Israel is our ally on the families of the 34 Americans they killed on the USS Liberty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ha ha, Marco Rubio is a joke,not as big a joke as Ted Cruz, but a funny joke none the less. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stand with Rand! Not jeb who is a democrat in disguise. He supports common core, bringing illegals in to boost the economy and god knows what other horrors. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It doesnt matter what you want. Youre going to get Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is for clowns. 89% of Democrats still support her not to mention minorities where she has a strong hold. Im voting for her because I am angry that women are treated in such way in America. Bush, Walker also did it but no reprisal for them. Why? Theyre men. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is sad, our country is turning into a joke. How and why was he voted into the senate? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fake, Fact, Forgery First letter of each word is F the sixth letter of the alphabet 666 I find that interesting..... And possibly intentional. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Walker or Rubio no more bush and Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Did you know? ISIS also throws nongays of buildings too. I guess they arent exciting to write about <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The saddest part about this is not that he thinks he can get the GOP nomination but the fact that hes a doctor! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The big takeaway from those results is that those five only represent 78% of the votes. Where are the other 22%? They are SOOOO fractured! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a Hispanic Im say whites and blacks liberals, and democrats who hate Rubio, they are racist, since they call us racist for hating Obama since hes black. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Will Marco Rubio hear the no experience argument? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio would make a good CNN libtard one day. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If he gets the nomination I will vote Democrat!!!!!!!!! He is not a people person does not sound sincere and weak on immigration does not care about the working man!!!!!!!!!! a real sorry ass at least he sounds like one!!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sad, sad, sad day for comedy but we still have Palin Ernst, Cruz, Rubio, and Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio will. Apocalypse is coming <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It took this video for me to realize that Obama would make a great comedian. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is corrupt as fuck and doesnt give two shits about cuba <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is so salty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio, a Cuban American who opposes Cuba policy shift because the Republicans told him so <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go for it Sen rubio. DEM has fucked up this country so much that We will vote Rep blindly. Word up!! good luck!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Notice hes quick to describe the problem.....low wages and a large underemployed populace. The last race promises were made that they were first priority. That was a flat lie.....the pipeline was first priority. So Rubio did not mention a solution. Mark my word.....he will eventually say cut corporate income taxes to zero so business can create jobs. Sound familiar? Just remember....there are two kinds of conservatives...the 1% and the suckers. Check your pockets!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The mandate is to take out the illegalalien trash, yet I read to today that Rubio has his name on a bill designed to bring in more foreign trash for the tech industry. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Notticed most Cubans are the same traitors... most get here illegally, get a free pass to Citizenship and then turn their back on their own people. Most Cubans in power like Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio give two shits about the nation that seen their parents born. They Have No honor, Zero respect for dignity and become Republicans. If I was in power and had the authority to, I would deport every single Cuban that crosses that damn waterline, lets not forget the cold war. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ill believe that RightWing race baiting conspiracy when the Republican party includes a significant amount of different races in their ranks. Until then, they have no argument, no evidence, no valid nor sound rationale whatsoever that would indicate its the Left thats perpetuating this false concept. On the Left white, black, brown we all get along JUST FINE. Its them who are projecting their own insecurities and mistrust onto us. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio shows he doesnt have an idea that wasnt halfbaked from some cold war era nitwit. Go back to Little Havana and stay in your little isolated area with the rest of the dinosaurs. Y Comemierda! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hypocritical views of Republican leaders. We dont see any Republicans pushing for democracy in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE,US partnersallies. Sen Rubio precampaign also assumes Hispaniscs other than CubanAmericans favor keeping the useless 50 year embargo. Cubans born and living in Cuba have been the only victims of this embargo... not the Castros regime... PD Most Hispanics are not voting for this guy....... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So according to Rubio China gets a pass because they are an economic giant. Reporter doesnt check him on that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FUCK OFF RUBIO. GO TO SUCK GEORGE W BUSH SUGAR CANE 028 Heres what the Cuban people get.. the Cubans are in Cuba. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey Rubio GO FUCK YOURSELF <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Way to go PRESIDENT OBAMA!!....YOU have done what 55 years of presidents have not had the guts to do. The people of Cuba do not have to continue to live in abject poverty AND hopelessness. Those Cubans who object in Miami will now have to let go of their SELFAGGRANDISEMENT that they have created for themselves.. And you MARCITO RUBIO you now have one less WEDGE ISSUE TO WIELD UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE..... HA HA! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio represents the past. Obama represents the future. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Marco Rubio is a fucking piece of shit. This fucker needs to go away. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is an Idiot, pure and simple. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio A Cuban who hates Cubans because the Republican establishment tells him to. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Both in the military and police officers, when you pull your gun you never shoot to wound you shoot to kill. Its standard procedure and if you were fighting someone for a gun you bet you would shoot someone 6 times over to make sure they were dead I would have done the same. At that point its their life or yours and I wouldnt lose my life for a thug. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This was purely murder,how is he posing a threat to the officers life if he is running away and then putting his hands up?Murdering cracker scum. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This man seems to think that, if something makes a woman feel threatened, something HES doing, then its HER fault for not having a gun. Hes basically telling me im not going to stop doing whats killing you, your sisters, your daughters, your friends and every woman youll ever meet. Im not. So you should probably carry a gun when you go out to buy milk because if you dont like it youll need it. Why are people like this allowed to exist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, I fucking hate this about politicians, cant answer simple questions. Mitch McConnel said when Obama was being president that he would would never work with him, this is fact. HOW WAS THIS MAN REELECTED? A guy who is working for the people wont do his job because of some kind of grudge he has against Obama. Now this guy is going to lead the Senate? Were doomed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Useless fodder. Both Graham and Rubio support amnesty and endless foreign wars, as well as other big government programs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Graham and Rubio are gayer than the any other major politician right now. They hide behind their religion and politics but they talk like they are gay with that southern twang. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul would be, by far, the best choice for a saner world. Bring back fairness, say no to war and yes to diplomacy and peace. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

marco rubio couldnt beat a cucumber for president. Not sure who that piece of fucking tea bagging shit thinks he is, but hes certainly not presidential material. Even the mickey mouse club wouldnt want that asshole for president of their fan club. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Its all the same. Nothing is going to change. Large donors decide policy in the U.S. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Americans are FED UP with Obamas sinking America. The silent majority have spoken. We want our Country back! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

damn that rubio character speaks good english just like the white folk. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a hypocrite and an opportunist! Everybody noise this! Give him another sip of water! It Looks Like He Can Use It, AGAIN! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mark Rubio, his philosophy is that if he bashes democrats enough it will make himself look better. He doesnt care if anything gets done in washington. He just wants to criticize Obama for everything he does. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mexican Authorities Watch out for all the vehicles with Florida license plates, many of these criminal gun smugglers come from there.

Excellent solution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
castro will help the illegals get housing but,americans will not and cannot because obummer wants their illegal vote and before he goes out of office he will give all those illegals amnesty so they will help vote in another communist like he is america needs to wake up and get obummer out before its too late <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio wants to rule the world! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

He related to Paulina Rubio? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio will next defy the rules of ARITHMETIC! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whatever you do, dont actually address what Rubio said. Just make fun of him for some made up reasons. Because Hillary was a massive failure. Then she quit, like she always does. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
MARCO RUBIO you take yourself too seriously. YouR rhetoric is that of a child trying to impress his parents with high minded principles and disingenuous references to God and country. You are fool to think that you are the multicultural answer to White America. Cubans, U.S. citizens and residents of Mexican decent despise you and your fluffy frothy patriotism. You are lock stepping with the most extreme Republican talking points. You dont impress anyone MARCITO. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Well for once I agree with Rubio. I think the US should stop showing so much hostility towards Cuba. Im not saying to pressure the Cuban government to shift to the right, but an attempt to diplomatic relations never hurt anyone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio has a good head on his shoulders. He has a good grasp on foreign policy. I agree 100%. Marco will make a good vice president for Dr. Rand Paul in 2016. Rand will pick up the slack on immigration and Rubio has foreign affairs covered. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For some reason, Micahel Rubio reminds me of Samuel L. Jackson, and a traitor. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

so, the debates are gonna be interesting... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damnit Rubio is correct thats why they just passed a Ukraine relief package The President asked for and he is condemning Russia and he is imposing sanctions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so what rubio is saying, he doesnt support obamas policy of standing by Ukraine and condemning russian action <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio looks like a child with wounded feelings <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck off Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

S.E you talk tough, but youll never make any personal sacrifice for this cause. If youre brave enough go inside Syria and join fight.

Rubio is the only one that can go against Hillary. Who else? Trump? Sleepy Carson? Ted Cruz was a master debater back in his college days so maybe he can do something. Cmon splash your face with some cold water and look at reality. Dont hand over the Presidency to Hillary in a silver platter with Trump and Zzz Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

your experts better start doing their homework, USA Today because Donald Trump is still LEADING the pack by substantial margins. No one is going to vote for Amnesty Rubio or that train wreck Fiorina. We, the people, want Donald J. Trump as our next President. Just because you dont like him doesnt give you the right to LIE about his standing in the race. SMH #TRUMP2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Vote for Trump guys. What can Marco Rubio do? Bring in more immigrants to make America poorer? huh? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clearly, the target of the booing is Rubio. While the title of the video is technically correct, the strong implication is that the crowd booed Trump. The people at USA Today use words for a living they know what theyre doing when they use words. This is lying by false implication. Shame on USA Today. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
they booed Rubio! They did the same thing with Bush at his rallies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They were booing Rubio. Incredibly obvious <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like how trump supporters were saying they were booing Rubio, but either before then or after because Im not sure since i didnt watch it, they are cheering Rubio the whole way, if the people were really booing Rubio than they still would have been booing at him when he walked out, This is why I dont believe they were booing at Rubio but rather trump because they probably tired of him being the pissy fit man he really is <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youtube search right side radio for the full version. They booed Rubio! The media is so dishonest! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The title is so misleading. They were booing Rubio! The crowd was obviously on Trumps side. This just shady journalism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is SEXY! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They were booing Donald not rubio if they agreed with trump they would have cheered when he said that to show that they agree but they booed at his comment instead just saying.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lets hope Rubio follows John,Scott, and perry <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
they were booing rubio you corrupt cunts <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There is a reason the boy rubio is losing every where he goes...rubios stance on abortion is insane...rubio would have you believe that if someone raped his wife, and she got pregnant, and that he had to chose between saving his wifes life or that fetus from another man, he would let his wife die, now that is truly fuked up..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ill tell you what, I would vote for Trump before I would vote for most of the republican candidates. The only other guys that I kinda like are Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im sorry, but with all due respect, how can Rubio say hes pro new American century when his POLICIES are the same old policies guaranteed to return us to the statusquo. Theres absolutely nothing different or new he would put forward in policy that hasnt been done before. Its deceitful to say new American century when peddling archaic policies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
None of these disgusting freaks intend to run for President. All the want is to keep the money donated to their superPacs. The Republican party is nothing but a boondoggle for whoremongers that cant hold a real job. Any fool with hepatitis and a Bible can buy a house by running on the Republican ticket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The presses is dumb. Marco Rubio brought a troop of worms to back him up by clapping when he said something. For the next one Trump has to bring another troop to back him up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio said It wasnt a credit card, it was an American Express charge card. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
and if they vote for Rubio the Cuban, he will make sure he give hispanics more of American jobs and all the races to the shit hole... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id rather bash Rubio for his sciencedenial and general rightwing spiel, not something like this, which is at least humorous. People pick trivial issues to focus on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson RINO wake up people. Trump is the only chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Club for Growth PAC supports increasing H1B visas and they have donated over 300,000 to Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio is cosponsoring a bill to increase H1B visas. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio is too young and it shows. Carson is a moron, and he lied on the Mannatech question. Trump is too immature, and he lied on the Zuckerberg quote...

wow! this report is bias and obvious on its intentions. When you listen to the whole speech, the audience was clearly BOOOING RUBIO and not Mr Trump. Somebody better record this video as it is so dishonest that it will be taken down. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I saw this speech on YouTube before seeing this video. I had to search for the original to check if they were talking about the same speech. The media are liars. The crowd obviously booed Rubio... My dad, a Barry Goldwater conservative, told me when I was a little boy never to trust the media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a retard piece of shit, if he gets elected our country is fucked. But they were booing Rubio in agreement with trump, so abc you failed in this vid. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

the media bias is outrageous. YouTube search the full version of all Donald Trumps events and speeches. in this case Donald Trump was not booed... the crowd booed Marco Rubios name when Trump brought it up. they also write about other things including his crowd sizes at is events. they are trying so hard to find something wrong. Vote for TRUMP!!! #TRUMP2016 Go TRUMP !!! . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That sounded like they were booing Rubio and agreeing with Trump. How do you get a boo for Trump from that? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hey that Rubio is a good speaker, has a good bio, good voting record, lots of potential. Hed be good for Presi Nope, he drinks water. Nevermind. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Cruz and Rubio are the future leaders of the Republicans, well good Luck. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lot of support for Bernie Sanders it seems, personally Im for Marco Rubio. He could debate Hillary most effectively and win those on the fence voters over. Plus hes a really promising leader. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
that ana is one bitter bitch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To support Trump you have to be a racist or a moron or both. There are not enough racist morons to put him in power. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Trump did crossed the line for being disrespectful and unapologetic like a 5 yearold spoil brat. Donald Trump should never be trusted because for the same reason that he killed the USFL, that semipro spring football league in the 1980s because he want to move the USFL to the fall. But when it comes to politics, hes lousy leader. And I dont believe Senator Marco Rubio comments on the Democrats. The Democrats do have good candidates for President and Im voting for a Democrat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio sucks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Debate winners Dr. Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Kusinich, Trump. Debate losers Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Walker, Huckaby. Big losers are the American people because Fox hosted and moderated the debate, what a joke that was. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Woman arent offended, he directed his comment at one woman who said bad things about him. He won the debate according to the New York Times and the Drudge Report. He lost the debate according to Frank Luntz and Rupert Murdock. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck you ABC News. Sen. Marco Rubio is more intellectual than your whole company combined with Fox News. This man should win the election period. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is an EFN IDIOT. First off, no one on that stage will be PRESIDENT. Unless the Neo Cons can manage to STEAL IT Obama has more class, dignity and grace than them all and other presidents in the passed. That is why was Truly Elected By The People For The People <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Outstanding! We need someone with Balls instead of these cowardly Queer Muslims, like Hussein, or lying RINOS like Jeb, Rubio, Graham, Perry, and the rest of the wimps who have sold their souls to the Lobbyists! Trump cannot be bought like DC Politicians! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What how did I watch this <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary will probably take the democrat nomination but Sanders might be vp. The republicans will need Bush and Rubio to get the florida vote but I think they will lose. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ok, Ive not made up my mind yet as to which candidate I prefer and I know very little about Marco Rubio BUT Ive watched this clip several times and just dont see what is so hilarious about it. Yeah, its a little bit of an awkward reach but the man needed a drink of water. If youre thirsty, youre thirsty. Id much rather the man take a drink of water for a dry throat than start having to clear his throat and cough. Republican, Democrat, whatever, whats the big deal? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
she is fading so bad shes going to reanounce her presidential bid. Everyone running is worried about Marco Rubio and they should be. Rubio 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I beg the people of America to not vote for this woman. Vote for Bernie Sanders. He has my vote. I hope he has yours. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its ironic because Florida actually needs the most global warming assistance yet their putting dumbass Rubio in office <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How can people actually support her? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Christy and Rubio but no Paul? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She can sing so good! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Diversity No white traditional family shown Progress Only show whites who are gay or a whites who are single This is so pathetic.

I see a white traditional family at 155, with a disabled child Fucking disgusting propaganda..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im getting ready to vote for Marco Rubio! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Rubio more... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shes all about the title, elect someone who really wants to make a difference. Rubio 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb or Rubio are better than her! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Queen Hillary the first. Marco Rubio for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thanks Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so basically as voters we have to choose between a sweettalking phony like Obama versus a guy who cant even control his faculties like Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The left has been saying for years that Rubio is way too thirsty to be the next president. This just plays right into their narrative... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio? America doesnt need some one worse than Obama! Marco would let the cartel run America! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary is not my first choice but after watching the alternatives Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Rick Perry.... I decided to vote for her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary all the way..... Look at the alternatives Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Rick Perry...... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a little bitch war hawk whose never severed in the armed forces. Rand is a fuckboy, Ted Cruz has no chance of winning. Mike Fuabee, makes old fat whites giddy. So, yeah, they have no winners. #hillaryclinton2016 ! #VoteBlue <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damnit, Rubio!! Drinking water like a fucking human! Whats your problem? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I know this man. I worked for him and his company for five years. he started from nothing and built a large company from scratch. but I do agree. its a bit excessive. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im really disappointed that HRC didnt explain the PRODUCTIVITY more from less of having two iPhones instead of one. What a distraction indeed! Also, when the Republicans use yesterday as Rubio did, he CANNOT deny Cuba further entrance into our long delayed union 90 miles away. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The GOP is pushing Mark Rubio because they realize one of their white old republicans wont work against her. To be honest i dont think Mark Rubio will work either. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It amazes me that its 2015 and republicans are still antiwomen, antieducation, antiscience, antiequality... They are living in the freakin dark ages. Its utterly disgusting that women are paid less for same work than men and republicans want to keep it this way. Im voting Hillary all the way! Im living in the 21st century NOT the 14th century! republicans are utterly demented and sick and stupid. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If you are more worried about Marco Rubios water drinking habits than his policies then I dont know what to tell you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id rather Putin look over and see Hilary than Rubio. If Putin were to look at Rubio...his stare would bring Rubio to his knees. Hilary has been reading and deciphering powerful men for more than 40 years. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio has spocks ear. That is the good thing. I am shaky about his immigration policy though <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama has failed miserably economically. He has chosen not to lead in foreign affairs and has allowed Islamic terrorism to grow with his ineptness to make it a priority. We need a conservative back in office with traditional values. God bless Mr.Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary is fake, I would rather see liz she is the real deal. All the rep are good Rubio wife is really hot if he wins she will be the hottest first lady of all time. Now some may say thats not a reason to vote but I say I am 60 and her good looks are real and that is better than some false promise <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only old Cubans will vote for Rubio, the rest of the Latinos wont. Rubio is a climate denier and a vote for Rubio is a vote for Netanyahu and more wars. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He looks gay <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I keep hearing Rubio is better than Hilary, False! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is Rubio the antiJeb who can win the nomination? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I searched rubio for todays videos and filtered them by view count. This video had the most views with 1,500 after 7 hours. I think its safe to say that America doesnt give a fuck about chickenhawk marco rubio. Thank god. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is genuine! No fakes in the white House in 2016! Marco Rubio a leader who stands up for America and her people! You got us Marco! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio LMAO this is going to be fun <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Also he was born in 1971, but his parents werent citizens until 1975, so although he was born here he is not a natural born citizen because he was Cuban at birth and became naturalized along with his parents. If he was to win the nomination the Leftist Media would suddenly learn about this and pull the rug out from under him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul, NO. Ted Cruz, NO. Marco Rubio, NO. Anyone else the GOP is gonna put up? So far, none of them stand a chance in 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is a great man... for me to poop on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its not that he took the drink...its the retarded way he did it! Somethings not quite right with him...elevator doesnt go all the way up...not the sharpest tool in the shed...a few fries short of a happy meal. Rubio too thirsty to be President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go for it!!!! Theres too many haters out there, but u can make it. What woukd this world be without a FIRST MAN OF THE US? good luck w ur campaigning in Iowa today! Keep Marco Rubio away from us please! Why not give it a try, we need a change! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cannot wait to see all of the butthurts WHEN she becomes our next President. It is inevitable. It HAS been inevitable. Look at the trash she is running against! Has and always will be. At times, eh, trash may not be taken out, but when it is, this country runs half ass like it should because of all the dooky that was left behind to clean up! haha P.S. I will be back 1116 to say, I told you so! heheh P <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If anyone supports her, their voting because of her sex and not because theyve actually been paying attention to her accomplishments. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
REAL Americans LOVE Hillary Clinton. Viva Hillary 2016!!! IF Republicans wont end their War on Women, WE WILL! 8 more years!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fair or not, this was Rubios Howard Dean moment. His stock was rising considerably until this fatal sip. It is amazing how we view politicians, and penalize them, I grant you. But how could he not know this ahead of time? LMAO this is as awkward as it gets. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Why would anyone take this Rubio guy seriously beats me. The guy is a wanna be hispanic panic politician. He is a GOP hispanic politician puppet on a string. The guy is a nervous wreck whenever he speaks. He is not a GOP rising star, more like a falling star. Like Ted Cruz, Rubio never fails to keep his foot in his mouth. In time he will fade away and became yesterdays news. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Id prefer Bernie but Ill take Hillary over ANY of the Republicans Ive seen so far. And Ive seen a whole lot of those clowns. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Boo to Rubio here, especially given his heritage. US can crush Cuba at the flick of a finger, why continue this policy of being scared of such a small ass country that was never a threat to our country at any point in our countrys history. And Communism and dictatorship are not synonymous. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Too small planes. They need to be sending B52s. Burn Raqqa like Dresden <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RUBIO aint bad. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Face it Republicans, your Presidential candidate in 2016 will be Marco Rubio, who will lose to Hillary Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you keep saying Rubio people will believe it. Sanders 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is the most Presidental out of all candidates <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio needs 8 years as Jebs Veep before he looks old enough to be a threat. Its gonna be Jeb!, you fools. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I used to kinda like Trump but after watching this I could never see this man being president of the United States. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio wants to handle the nations finances the same way he handled his own . He wants more wars and more dead Americans . Oh , yeah, that will work really well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am a Liberal but Rand Paul and Kasich seemed to be the clear winners of tonight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is such a disappointment. So many of us expected big things from him a few years ago. He just got owned here by war hawk Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand makes the most sense every time but Rubio stays on top because of his made for TV American Dream style rhetoric. Id rather vote for the more sensible one. Obama is a pretty good personality too. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
marco rubio, you fucked up handling money, some people say you cant handle trillions of dollars. his answer..... im not experienced with money, but fuck you for asking. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How did Rubio shine? I dont remember him saying anything of any value. He sounds like the least sincere candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I call for the incarceration of obama, hillary, george bush, cheney, boehner, mcconnell, lindsey graham, schumer, hatch, eric holder, lois lerner, sotomayor, john roberts, cornyn, lamar alexander, gutierrrez and rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id vote for Rubio before bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rubio is a sandbagger ...guys a lazy ass liar! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
1 credibility point for Rubio due to AP endorsement <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This debate showed that having passion BALLS about the job is a big plus. The most passionate came up in the polls, while the ones who played it safe, were devisive, were doves or were not unifying went down in the polls. Among the winners of this debate were Trump, Fiorina, Cruz, Rubio Christie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fiorna sucked... Acted like the entitled rich bitch she is! Im voting trump, Christie or Rubio... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
not if rubio the fraud has his way <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We can start by sending Rubio back to Cuba. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio and Cruz not eligible to be President of the United States. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They know its 2015 and you dont need an office space to run spies, right? Right??!?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I most certainly have questioned McCAINs patriotism in the past...Look up Images for john mccain with isis leaders. So fuck Traitor, good for nothing McCAIN! Furthermore, Losers Kerry, Bush, Jindal, Graham, Rubio, etc., can all eat the Dons Dust all the way to the Whitehouse in 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would vote for him if i was still in America, Americans Dont be dumbasses and vote for Hillary clinton,Jed Bush GOD NO, and Marco Rubio. None of them deserve to be presidents. Only candidate i see worthy is Donald and Bernie sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I can actually say that Mr. President Obama earnt my toughest unearned respect in the history of all respected presidents. I mean.. DAmn ... To bad this is his last term. Next term, I. Going for the Hispanic president.. Forgot his name, but he seems like he is For lowmiddle class... I can tell he come from the gutta <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow is anyone even considering him seriously? I thought his while campaign was and is a joke. Anyways the race for the Republican candidate is between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, Jeb probably has it in the bag #JebBush2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He thinks that a mass murderer is the greatest man alive? Hes the only candidate that makes me like Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bullshit. Bernie would be better and his voting record proves iton the other hand her voting record proves she is a bold faced liar. Just like her husband. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is that Marco Rubios ship? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol, each Bush that runs for president is more stupid than the previous. I cant wait until George Bush the 5th runs, hell need to wear a bib just to keep the drool off his dungarees. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio and Ted are the chistian Version of the Taliban and the Islamic State of SiriaIraq they will criminalize the women rights and they would impose the Burka, chador and Niqab in all the women faces <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree. Millionaires and Billionaires shouldnt collect social security. They have enough money already. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LIKE OBAMA BEFORE HIM RUBIO WOULD BE A PUPPET FOR THE WASHINGTON ELITE TO STEER WHICHEVER WAY THEY CHOOSE. HE NEEDS MORE EXPERIENCE. RAND PAUL IS THE ONLY REAL CHOICE AT THIS POINT. HE DID THAT LONG ASS FILIBUSTER...STANDS UP TO THE ELITE AND HAS PATRIOTIC WISHES FOR THE NATION INCLUDING OBOLISHING THE IRS AND AUDITING THE FED. CHOOSE SMART...CHOOSE..SMART! BRUCE CAMPBELL SHOULD RUN! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well have a Latino POTUS but it wont be Marco Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck off Rubio you piece of giant political koch brother shit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cotten mouth Rubio <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shes going to win <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WHY ARENT THEY PROTESTING THE SUNNI MUSLIM SATANIC TRAITOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO FORGED HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND DESTROYED OUR BORDERS? WHAT ABOUT BENGHAZI?!!! WAKE UP AMERICA! YOU ARE ALL BRAIN DEAD! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary will run. Hillary will win. Warren Buffet I agree. I cannot imagine any of the following Republicans being elected POTUS Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Sarak Palin, John Kasich, Donald Trump, Chris Christie, or Marco Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
yea, but NOT you for sure! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sad, sad, sad day for comedy. Wait! We still have Palin, Ernst, Cruz, Rubio and Carson. Great! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So, essentially the New Cuba Policy is a means of moving U.S. subversion control directly onto the Cuban mainland in a continuing attempt to convince the Cuban people that subjugation by the U.S. neoliberalism is preferable to the government theyve supported since the revolution. The more things change the more they stay the same. Its a sad commentary that a capitalist Batistist tool like Rubio is in Congress rather than selling pencils from a cup on the street. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Way to go PRESIDENT OBAMA!!....YOU have done what 55 years of presidents have not had the guts to do. The people of Cuba do not have to continue to live in abject poverty AND hopelessness. Those Cubans who object in Miami will now have to let go of their SELFAGGRANDISEMENT that they have created for themselves.. And you MARCITO RUBIO you now have one less WEDGE ISSUE TO WIELD UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE..... HA HA! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RUBIO IS NOT AWARE OF A NEW WORLD ORDER WITH A NEW WORLD RELIGION RULED BY AN ILLUMINATI PLANET, CUBA THING IS AN ANCIENT NEWS... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All those standing behind him are Floridas Cuban senators just so you know. Rubio will get nowhere talking like that if he wants to get elected. Obama is the only person in the planet that can make this deal happen. Hes a problem solver. Its amazing how his level of influence around the world is off the charts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio looks and talks alot like Matt Damon... Marco Rubio is....Jason Bourne... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio here argues that this will exacerbate the bad situation in Cuba with no proof whatsoever. Rubio and other Republican representatives RELY HEAVILY ON THE CUBAN EXILE VOTE. So much that they NEED to keep this economic strangulation. The embargo makes Cuban leaders look incompetent, they need that bad guy. This is truly despicable... they want votes at the expense of a shitty Cuban economy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio do not know the meaning of peace. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio should look at China. The US loses jobs and gets nothing for the relationship. Hypocrite much. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio wants the Cuban people to keep being repressed <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is a fear monger and ignorant <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fat boy making an ass of himself just kissed his chances of running for president goodbye. Voters will tolerate goofy mayors that do drugs and fall down drunk. They will for awhile tolerate politicians that email photos of their genitals or governors that are corrupt, but never some buffoon that runs his mouth and bullies as president. NEVER. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
NO! The bus driver and the daughter were putting their hands all over a girl who just wanted off the bus <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The shoe thrown at Republican scum Bush will always be number 1. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Christie or Rubio are the Zionist illuminati picks <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I just love the way Rubio backs up his claims about the Presidents foriegn policy with good, specific examples about how it has failed. When he says, has brought us to this stage , he tells us exactly what that means! This isnt vauge, meaningless politcal dribble at all! When Jingle says,assult on religious liberties thats code for hes lettiin the queers get married. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fucking NeoCon piece of FUCKING TRASH!!!! We cannot bomb every fucking country you piece of fucking shit!!! YOU WERE NEVER IN THE MILITARY RUBIO!!! YOU DONT KNOW SHIT!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
