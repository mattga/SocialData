Jeb Bush wont win the Republican nomination with this message @ColoredSpaces <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is the most ridiculous thing ever. Although he should have rephrased his comments a bit, what Trump said is 100% accurate.

Its a disgusting reality... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush AGAIN. Lard gawd. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb bush trying to capitalize on something that was misinterpreted. Jeb Bush is desperate and I understand HIllary Clinton lying but Jeb Bush stooping to that level! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
His brother started this whole thing and now he has the audacity to point finger at Obama. Jeb Bush, take several seats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To hell with the media.... PC blows ....Trump for President 2016 ........ Unify the country ... Stop illegal immigration ... repeal Obamacare ... stop jobs from going overseas ... equalize trade deficits ... simplify income taxes ... no income tax for singles who make 25K or less ... couples who make 50K or less ... 15% tax rate for any and all businesses and corporations ... close tax loopholes ... make America great again ........ <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No more bushes !! Gorge W Bush started this war and Jeb would only make it 10X worse!!............................................................ TRUMP 2016!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I havent heard Rubio get crazy yet. He may be the one. Trump and Carson want to start the new American Nazi party. I just wish Rubio didnt have such a creepy smile. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RAND PAUL 2016 Marco Rubio is just another establishment neocon. He is basically a younger, more hip version of Jeb Bush and he wont do anything about the Federal Reserve! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Chris Christie has the best chance of all the governors of winning the nomination, not Jeb Bush. Even so, Christie is still a bit of a long shot. John Kasich really should be the one with the best chance, but for whatever reason, people just dont like the guy. His chances are probably just slightly better then Bushswho has the lowest chance IMO. Huckabee probably has the second best chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush George W. Bushs brother. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just leave the race Rand. Youre short and youre done. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who said only Christians should be allowed in? Fuck this guy. He is just a tool <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is an imbecile and these problems are a direct and predictable consequence of Bushs decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Look at Jeb!s poll numbers if you think Bush is not getting blamed for this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love how people think he isnt relevant. He is a very dangerous individual and sadly will at some point in time be a President. The Bush family isnt going anywhere, do people not know that history repeats?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is such a weakling he makes me cringe listening to him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FOX is full of fucking idiots, look at these clueless arseholes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clueless pundits as usual. Jeb Bush, really? He is the weakest of the bunch. He is the one Democrats want to get the nomination. These pundits should be replaced by people who bet on these things for a living. They would know, because if they get it wrong, they go broke. These pundits have been wrong from the get go. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
obama is a friend... trump is a leader <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Donald Trump, but i wish he would shut up about Carson. I understand he is low energy, and he is way too nice, but going after him for stuff he said he did when he was 14 years old?...Come on Donald... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Like I said he is our ONLY LAST HOPE! PEOPLE THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT AMERICA AND WE NEED TO TAKE IT BACK HOME!!!!!! TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP!.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ISIS are fucking cowards. I hope theyre all killed. Every single one. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This alone will win him the nomination. WHY? Because you idiot talking heads are NOT LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE! Stop the spending, close the border, and repeal obamacare. If they had done this, Jeb Bush would probably be leading in the polls right now. These ladies are idiots! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wish Jeb! would go away, we dont need another Bush in office. But he has had such progress and success in Florida, maybe he should stay there and leave the rest of us alone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
establishment hack rove really hates trump .. the person who made money on Obama phone the partner of carlos slim , is jeb bush , who before he ran for president , transferred his stock to his son so there would be no disclosure ... the bushes Clintons make millions on their policies .... so obvious rove has a brown nose from jeb .... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everyone going so easy on Jeb today. I think everyone knows hes done for after last night. Kasichs major disaster performance was the only thing that mitigated Jebs moderate disaster performance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted cruz is too right wing to win. Jeb and Carly have the real chances and maybe even Rubio <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Watch out for Jeb!. He HAS to try something tonight. Someone please, have his Daddys number ready. Baby Bush probably just asked paid for more time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Lol yea, lets put prince Jeb in charge of the military. What can go wrong under a Bush White house? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has a wrong view of history says Jeb inferring his is correct. THIS WHOLE MESS STARTED WITH GEORGIES IRAQ WAR!! We financed a 2 trillion war betting the economy on real estate value. The result is a bankrupt America and chaos in Middle East. It infuriates me when propaganda peddles such BS. The correct view of history is that... BUSH WAR <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Think 12 months ahead, not 12 minutes ahead. Trump will carpet bomb Hillary or Joe Biden with Negative Ads and walk into the White House January 2017. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How the hell bill gets a show is amazing he always lies but I guess he panders to those with very little intelligence <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is trash and a traitor. He was a friend with him last week talking nice things about him and now he want to you use these lies to destroy him. This is only going to help Carson . Dr. Carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Johnson, Nixon, Reagan, Bush sr, B Clinton, Bush jr, obama. All liars. Carson, h clinton cunt, jeb bush, liars. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

jeb bush you are as strong as a wet paper bag,we dont want you, you weakling TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah, he defended his country by attacking the wrong country. So convincing. I wonder if this little critique is meant to help out Jeb with his campaign, trying to restore some sort of legitimacy to the Bush name. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anytime I want a laugh I turn on fox news <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OH MY GOD DID YOU HEAR WHAT JEB BUSH IS SAYING HE IS SAYING USA IS IN GOOD SHAPE AND HE LIKES PRESIDENT OBAMA WOW HOLLY SHIT THIS IS BIG <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The FOX owners know that under freemarket capitalism their business monopoly will fall to smaller competitors. As a result, they would be more happy with Hitlary or Jeb Bush or Trump than with Ted Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder why Jeb Bush keeps hovering in the polls. Do you think the bankers, Wall St, and the likes of the Koch brothers already have picked our candidate? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is honest Holy shit OReilly.................. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In all the Internet polls it show Donald Trump at 89 % and Carson at 12 % WHY FOX NEWS PULLING OUR LEG ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

you cant even talk about Ted Cruz for 2 minutes you had to start talking about Marco Rubio and a segment about Ted Cruz because you despise Ted Cruz so much we all know the establishment Donald Trump establishment Jeb Bush establishment despised the great Ted Cruz <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush campaign was over since the day Donald Trump jump into the race <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont think Jeb wants to run for President, he looks unmotivated, probably because of his last name the jokes associated with it, I think hes content with the office he currently holds or whatever hes doing, its less stress, privacy a steady paycheck plus the inside perks of being a Bush, just my opinion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It was a great success for all of us. It proved that there is no such thing as the Smart Bush.. Goodbye Jeb, you were outsmarted by the idiot John Harwood LOL <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush cannot become the President of the U.S. He is so bad. His brother was bad too. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox News keeps trying to prop up Jeb Bush. Marco Rubio is the other neocon candidate. Inevitably it will be the establishment behind Rubio vs. the outsider candidates #BenCarson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A Jeb Bush nomination is a guaranteed Republican loss in the general election. Jeb Bushs number 1 supporter in the Republican Primaries is Hillary Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My condolences to Jeb! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is such a weak candidate that Honey Boo Boo can make him look bad in a debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fox news keeps trying to prop up the establishment candidates, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, its a bunch of crap. We dont want anymore neocons. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
its not the mods fault they cant answer hard questions, not to say that isnt a clinton coronation on the horizon #Bernie16 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is a joke I actually like Jeb Bush but would never vote for him because of his brother. Rubio seems like hes all talk. Slimy politician. Huckabee is a joke lol Kinda like Carson Cruz is cool but too right wing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am not an American, i have been really following the debates and the candidates on both sides, just my gut instinct and my feeling as a believer in God, each time when i see Jeb Bush i could feel that the seed of Bush family has war spirit in them, no matter which Bush you elect, now and for many generations to come, there will be wars.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I predict Bush will drop out before Christmas. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The people of the United States are not stupid enough to ever let another Bush in office . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush just always looks weak and hesitant ....Jeb will never get votes looking the way he does. He needs to give up on his Whitehouse wet dream. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush stinks of desperation. His weakness on illegal immigration makes him an extremely unappealing candidate. Cant wait till he drops out so his points can go to other republicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
jeb is a cunt <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only talking heads whining about the CNN moderators or their ?s are the racist, sexist, homophobic Republi cans their ilk. IMO the moderators were razor sharp fact checked those blow hards around every turn. The debate was awesome, but now I bet the next one will be stacked with right wing types will be a total snooze fest, every one of these Republic bafoons getting on their soap boxes to run out the two hours st8 into an old rerun of The Golden Girls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Exclude the name bush from jebs name and his numbers on the polls fall, dramatically. Jeb Bush is getting his getting his votes from name recognition. Marco Rubio is the only GOP candidate that has a chance of beating the democratic nominee . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush sucks <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb never had his heart in this from the start. He was pushed into running by his family and the GOP. The people do not want another Bush in the drivers seat. Dynastic succession is not democracy. Stay out of the bushes and vote for TRUMP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hes the only Republican who isnt super extreme. Thats why he doesnt get headlines. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The reason that Jeb Bush is losing is because he has no message! Voters dont know why they want to vote for him and so they will lose interest. Jeb wants to win this election only with money and it wont work! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben is such a fine gentleman. and Trump is clearly a juvenile arrogant joke of a man. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bennett is establishment...that is why he is only a little betrayed. If these RINO politicians would have repealed obamacare, stopped the spending, and sealed the border, Jeb Bush would be leading in the polls right now and all would be well in Bill Bennetts world. Bill Bennett and the rest of the conservatives in Congress have redefined the word and that is why they dont think Trump is a conservative.

He didnt say he was responsible ,He said the US wasnt safe under W Bush like his dumb brother Jeb claimed , I barely watch the media and i know better than this dumbass expert . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am a huge George W. Bush fan but the fact is we were hit under his administration. Do I blame him completely? Of course not! However, Mr. Trump is not saying anything untrue and Jeb actually is. Yes, we were safe AFTER 911 and, frankly, more so than any Democrat could provide because no one messed with Dubya. However, facts are facts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The wall street journal was bought for 5 billion dollars and its now worth 500 million dollars, they dont have to tell me what to do Trump... LEGENDARY <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with everything except for the notion that Jeb is a good man. Jeb is the beta male of the crime syndicate bush family. Hell run this country in the ground faster than it takes illegals to walk over our border. Bush 1 gave us Clinton to ruin the country, Bush 2 gave us Obama to devastate us, im scared to death what Bush 3, Jebbidiah would give us. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the bush family is done. Its going to be Trump......do you understand?you fucking rinos? Trump is going to be the nominee,. jeb has no chance,and hes not going to be included in the Trump administration. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Clinton actually instigated the hunt for bin Laden and the special rendition programme to take out key players in the muslim extremist mileau. Jeb Bush ommits that <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Bush family are like hemorrhoids that keep popping back up and Jeb is a fucking Hispanic pandering pussy. He met some hooker down in Mexico that married him only for US citizenship and his money, so now he wants to please her by letting all of Mexico in. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really have to wonder who the bushs lined up to hack voting computers as was done for DUFUS BUSH. Jeb claims he is his own person? Uh take a look at his team. ALL ARE DUFUS BUSH PEOPLE AND DADDY DUMPKINS PEOPLE. And of course, all of them LIED AND ARE LYING ABOUT 911. Jeb Bush isnt smart. Were he, he would stay out of politics. Hey Jeb! SCRAM!! Those damned bushs are sickening ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Youre a joke Jeb, the world knows 911 was Bush and Cheney gang ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is propaganda to fuel the Jeb Beady Eye Bush campaign and opinion polls. Basically on 911 they took a giant runny smelly shit on the American public. Theyve spent the next 15 yrs spreading it around so it infects just about everybody. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dont worry about Republican majority in Congress and Senate that are the least productive and least popular in history, Just keep worrying about those Emails.. By the way.. Trump says that Bush was responsible for 911..... No hearings on that? or how we got lied into war? or the anthrax that came from our own Government lab? No investigations of any of that? just emails,, really? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is so right. The Bushes are a bunch of pansies who never had the balls to stand up to their own rhetoric. Jeb Bush and his dipshit older brother are the main reasons the Middle East is blowing up today. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is a Muslim and is doing everything to help his faith in Muslim world... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bushs first challenge is overcoming being challenged <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The didnt attack us because we gave them visas. They attacked because of the interventions we did over in the Middle East. That makes Ron Paul right, and Trump and Jeb 100% wrong.... But Bush can absolutely be blamed for what he did AFTER 911. He exploited us and invaded Iraq. Gave us tyranny like the Patriot Act. That makes Georgie a terrorist himself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marvin Bush was a director at Stratesec, a security firm in charge of security at the World Trade Center. Jeb Bush had federal agents seize documents from Huffman Aviation company that trained the supposed terrorists.

Jeb Bush says his brother George W Bush kept the country safe. What world is he living in? 911 happened under George W Bush. Over 4,000 people were killed. He then started two wars resulting in the deaths of over 7,000 of our troops. The stupid war in Iraq started by George W Bush has created more terrorism than ever. This is what Jeb Bush calls keeping us safe? President Obama has kept us safe, not George W Bush. Jeb Bush is living in a fantasy world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump said I think eminent domain is wonderful. This guy is not a conservative. Imagine Jeb Bush, or Rand Paul saying something like that. Conservatives would lose it. If he wasnt worth 4 billion, conservatives would be calling him a socialist right now. This is sad. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He needs to think fast. Trump,Carson and Fiorina all overtook him.Hes just not shining. I wouldnt rule him out though....only Jeb needs to go along with Graham,Santorum and Jindal. Theyre all clowns. Oh and Huckabee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald Trump is a joke, Jeb Bush is a joke, Marco Rubio is a joke, Ted Cruz is a joke, Ben Carson is a joke, The Republicans are a joke, Fox News is a joke. But none of this is making me laugh anymore. The games over, Bernie Sanders is going to win, and we will get the money out of politics. Then media channels like Fox News will have to earn their money the old fashioned way by actually doing real reporting and not taking bribes from the rich. We will get our democracy back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

FUCK Jeb Bush and fuck his entire family. Fuck his mother. Fuck his brother. Fuck his filthy father and fuck his ugly as wife. And fuck all their pieces of spoiled ass kids.

Trump has no right or moral grounds to attack Jeb bushs wife like he did because his own wife is eastern european model , so called trophy wife. Wtf, trump supporters? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio or Cruz will win in the end . If you elected trump as rep. Candidate, allies, not rest of the world start to hate america. However, trump has a point ..still, he is unbelievable amateur and his 3 rd wife is Slovenian lingerie model and also immigrant . He has no right to attack Jeb bushs Mexican wife, okay with accusation like him. My question is Do you really want a Slovenian model as First Lady, conservative people ? Are you France? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is NOT in the middle of the pack. Hes nose diving like a single engine prop plane out of fuel, filled with sender blocks. Who needs him. We need leadership, not a Charlie Brown. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Republicans have wasted their opportunity to lead. They got nothing done at all while in control of the senate and congress. This is why they will be thrown out of office in 2016. Repubs have ONE idea,,, cut taxes for the rich and increase military and police spending. When trickle down economic, perpetual war, and mass imprisonment failed they were out of ideas. Nothing is left but a hollow shell. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The GOP needs a shakeup! The leadership is full of RINOs! The GOP leadership is wondering why someone like Trump is leading in the polls and this is why There were elected to do a few things, 1. repeal obamacare. 2. close the border. 3. Stop the spending. If they had done these things, someone like Jeb Bush would be the front runner...Get rid of all lawyer politicians! If the GOP is to survive, its going to need an enema. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jebs primate brother started all this heavy middle eastern crisis in the first place with his relentless wars in that side of the world. I fucking hate the Bush family. They are the spawn of Satan. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Russia and Syria have been close allies for over 6 decades. Bush is as stupid as his brother to want to impose an American, unilateral nofly zone. This is practically calling for war with Russia. Jeb talks about threats to our national security. He is the biggest threat to that with his arrogant neocon views. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We have had 3 Bush terms and 3 recessions. The last Bush caused an entire economic collapse. Time for new blood, not more skull and bones members. Jeb is the New World Order part 3 The financial collapse continued. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald Trump is the king of flipflopping, dodging questions like the matrix,and just straight line. I cant tell you how many times Ive heard with my own ears on a video him saying one thing he gets called out on it and says no I never said that and Pussy Fox News gravels to his feet so they wont test him on it. Aso Roger Ailes likes him for some strange reason so he puts the word out there that nobody gives Trump any hard balls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well in her defense... she was only a model so she could land herself a desperate old dude that she would never look twice at if he wasnt wealthy.

Oh Please, I concur with Buffet the Global economy has reached peak bullshit. And if you dont have a product you will starve. Trump is living on the edge of his toes and lost his network job to Schwarzenegger. His income comes from licensing his brand name to Japanese developers, and he collects a small fee managing properties. He makes nothing and owns nothing. Just a fluffer for Jeb and the Bush family.

Jeb Bush for president!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
George HW Bush NEW World ORDER JEB BUSHs PROJECT For a NEW AMERICAN CENTURY George W BUSH False FLAG 911 ATTACKs PATRIOT ACT HIGH TREASON and WAR CRIMEs ! All Need to be ARRESTED and HUNG !! GO DONALD <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DONALD Kicked Ass WON George HW BUSH New World Order JEB BUSH Project for a New AMERICAN Century George W BUSHs False FLAG 911 ATTACKs PATRIOT ACT TREASON ARREST HANG this CRIMINAL FAMILY <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush political ambitions has been stained, by his family legacy. That legacy includes mass murder, torture, domestic spying programs, secret society based agenda etc. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald never insulted Bushs wife. He may have insulted Jeb by saying he could not be impartial about Mexican immigrants, but who hasnt thought that. But Columba Bush is legally here and the illegals are illegal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush seems really desperate. There is a reason why Trump has been winning polls in Florida, the state where Jeb is governor of. I dont know the reason. I guess only the people in Florida will know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny that Paul says that Trump is a fake conservative because he supported Obamacare yet he votes to fund it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb, one thing about your brother, he was complicit in a False Flag operation that resulted in the the destruction of the Twin Towers, the death of numerous American citizens and a war against a nation that had nothing to do with it. Bush, Cheney and the entire congress should all be tried for treason and shot, both sides of the aisle <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rove worked for Bush Jr., so naturally he favors Jeb and amnesty <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush....Get out of the way !!!! DONALD TRUMP in 2016 !!!! Ben Carson for VP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has impressed me. He seems calm under pressure wonder how much of that comes from being a Neurosurgeon humble and intelligent. I think he would be a pretty good President. I would be alright with Carson,Cruz or Jindal. I also like Huckabee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox defends Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio all the establishment , proamnesty, RINO traitors. Then Fox attacks all the principled outsiders, Trump, Carson this surprised me because I thought Carson did well and Im a Trump fan so it exposes Krauthammer for his phony establishment views, and a backhanded compliment to Rand, but then goes on to compliment Christies pathetic night. Christie did NOT look good... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Could one sane person actually see Dr. Carson as a presidential nominee? I think hes not well spoken, and i could not see him negotiating a Iran redeal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP 2016, NO MORE BUSH NO MORE CLINTON, Those faceless Donors gave JEB 100 million and his still losing to Trump LMAO, what a low energy loser, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so when Jeb! wheres his ReaganBush 84 shirt to speak to voters is that being adorable too? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand paul and Jeb Bush Suck #Trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
None of this matters. Its way too early. The bluebloods will attack both Carson and Trump while talking up Jeb Bush. It will work. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont vote for Jeb Bush unless you want another 911! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It was funny to see Jindal give his speech to like 10 people, even Jeb bush gets at least 20 sleeping people at his speech <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is for a no fly zone over Syria, supporting the moderate rebels and taking out Assad sounds to me hes just like Barack Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant imagine a more deplorable candidate, or a worse disaster for my country and the world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THE NUMBERS SEEM GOOD TO ME! FEEL THE BERN MOTHERFUCKERS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What about Jeb Bush using a private server? Why does not fox boobs talk about that? By the way, did you know how many Benghazis happened during the kingdom of georgie w bush? Thirteen! Lets talk about those. By the way, I support Bernie, but I cannot stand the dumbass fox boobs attacking any Democrat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This Uncle Tom, will never achieve the Republican party presidential nomination. To many racist within the power structure of the party who will allow it to happen. The race is really between, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz. However on the contrary, none of the Republican presidential candidates listed above will not even get close to beating either Hilary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. Hilary Clinton, will be the next president of the United States. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I feel sorry for conservatives their picks are a woman, hating, racist Donald Trump and War Mongering Jeb Bush sad day to be a conservative. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bye bye Rand you are next to hit zero. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The smart people will coalesce around Trump not losers. Get on the bandwagon of success not failure. Reagan did Bed Time for Bonzo, why should Trump be disqualified because he did a TV show demonstrating his discussion making methods and because he created a multibillion dollar business? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As we can see by the comments of those that support the clown Trump, they are all brutish, juvenile, disrespectful clowns. ...........and they are many. ...........scary to see. God have mercy on the US. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is so fake and twofaced. I think his 15 minutes are over. Next GOP loser for the GOP losers to pretend they support, please. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump 2016 ! ! Fck the Establishment destroying countries World Wide, including America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Americans are polarizing further towards absolutes, tired of relativism. Americans want definitive leadership. Some Americans are becoming less tolerant of nonwhites and more towards nationalism, while other Americans want total borderless egalitarianism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is full of ideas and substances. This country needs a problem solver like Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

FOX NEWS THE NEW MSNBC,trying to do a hatchet job in the DON for the chosen one JEB BUSH. your not making the trip FOX we the voters see right through your contrived bullshit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am afraid carson is just too nice. Romney was too nice and Obama flung mud all over him. Hilary is a snake who has no morals and will say whatever lie she can to get elected. And if the nominee cant fight back they will just be demonized so much they wont win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is right, Trump is an S hole. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Murdoch wants Jeb Bush.. so this is a promo for him. Well, I dont care what Murdoch wants! Fuck the media! Go Trump!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
JEB BUSH ISNT READY FOR SHIT! FUCK HIM AND FUCK HILLARY! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
More bullshit from Fox, I guess mainstream media wants to ignore the poll that has Trump beating every Democrat candidate. Jeb lost a lot more then half his support, yet you are going to keep getting these paid pundit bozos to come on TV and push for the establishments choice Bush onto fox viewers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb bush is a Bonemans from Yale University, he even set his watch 10 minutes ahead of time so he can pull a fast one over you ! VOTE 4 DONALD ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

jeb bush is a fool and has no chance no matter how many retards on tv say otherwise <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb bush is the dry toast, wall paper, uninspiring, lack luster candidate of the GOP. He can not win simply put, not to mention he is pretty damn dumb. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is Fox News STILL talking about Jeb Bush? Put a fork in him, hes done. The People want DONALD TRUMP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol why do they keep talking about Jeb. Nobody wants a Bush <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ingraham is right Rove is wrong.... But, go ahead FNC....continue to bring on Karl Rove who is pushing for Jeb Bush.... it will do nothing to further Bush all to alienate your viewers even more convince most of them to vote for one of the current top three. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
vote Jeb Bush <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She is wrong. Almost none of Americans know the names of each and every player in Middle Eastern politics, making gotcha questions about Middle East players a nonissue, which average fairminded Americans dont penalize candidates for this, including Jeb Bush or Donald Trump. Heck, all the players names sound alike to most people and they are all originally written in nonEnglish letters, causing Americans to look at it as all those foreign messes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is a nonfactor. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wanna see Donald Trump vs Jeb Bush in an epic battle of mixed martial arts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who is Jeb Bush??? I do not think he should be mentioned in the same sentence with Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Petty, petty, petty, petty, petty. You guys are absolutely RIDICULOUS!!!!!! Youre all being paid off by Jeb Bush. And STOP SAYING that Trump supporters are sticking up for him, like he cant handle himself. Thats total BS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb bush supports open borders, jeb would love to see our country destroyed by hoards of illegals <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb bush is no different than Hillary Clinton both are establishment candidates who are in bed with lobbyists, jeb bush is weak on immigration, jeb said illegals raping and murdering Americans is a act of love TRUMP 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Right now it looks like its Carson vs. Trump. I really want those two to go head to head as candidates who never held office. Obviously Carson would come out on top as the more serious candidate, but itll be good to see Trump lose the spotlight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox is really trying hard to get the establishment GOP guy in there as nominee..Bush3.0 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so Bush knew all the names of these guys and our current Emperor knows all the names maybe deciding what to do would be the thing to worry about maybe someone who decides things for a living very well would be more qualified then one of Karl Roves bozos or Jeb Bush or Hilary ... how many pieces against this executive who is running for the job of chief executive does Fox have to run a day? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
4.35 .. puts jeb bush in the crotch hair? lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb doesnt want Trump to spend money securing the homeland. Seems to me its a lot cheaper and more important than the last Bushs Iraq war. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Get it right, Megyn!!! Ever since Day One, its been BUSH and others attacking Trump! Not the other way around! If they cant take the blowback from Trump DONT START IT. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If bush wasnt a democrat in republican clothing he might be higher in the polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is the one focusing on Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I know Ben Carson is quiet and thats his personality but I want a president who gives the people motivation and makes a nation believe. When George Bush was president he had great vocalization and would really get the people energized and determined. I can see that with like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Chris Christie. I just dont see that with Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who is Jeb Bush <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its over for trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I pledge to NEVER vote for Jeb Bush. Jeb Bush is the epitome of everything wrong with Washington, today special interests and bigmoney donors controlling those who are supposed to be the peoples representatives. The RNC and DNC are sickeningly corrupt. NO Jeb. No Hillary. No matter what. Trump the Establishment! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
jeb Bushs daddy was behind JFKs murder his brother knew about 911. We dont need a bushback in the White House <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

My entire family is going to vote Trump My mother and father... my two sisters and My Mexican fiends are voting Trump. 90% of my friends are voting for Donald Trump. Trump is exactly what the USA needs in a leader <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is exciting and I love him but art the end of the day Ben Carson is the sanest choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Chris Christie is a big fat Zero. He has more lies than Wussy Jeb Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

FOX NEWS, QUIT PUSHING JEB BUSH ON US!!! WE ALL HATE HIM AND HIS WHOLE EVILCORP FAMILY!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant watch either of these candidates without cringing...but at least Trump is speaking truthfully about the hispanic culture problem whereas Jeb Bush probably secretly agrees with him but the benefits of votes outweigh his willingness to speak openly <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He survives because his fan base is unwavering. Theyre idiots. His hypocrisy, his track record, his awful personality, his failed businesses, bankruptcies, 4 marriages, tax evasion... none of that matters to them, they dont care about facts. Theyre just fanboys of the apprentice whose simple minds fall prey to corny marketing. Its not their fault, they dont know any better. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Holy SHIT!!! Who is that lady behind Jeb bush at 1.00??? To his right. Good God.... that lady looks like shes already dead! I mean really, how is that lady still alive and breathing? She looks like a friggin corpse. The walking crypt keeper. I give that old lady 2... 3 months tops before she kicks the bucket. And thats being generous. I mean.... you look in to her eyes and she has no soul. Shes pretty much already departed.Spooky... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am sick and tired of these kinds of bimbos coming on TV and blasting our GOP front runner! It seems the political class in DC is in tank with Jeb Bush. It was very clear from this interview where this whore would sleep at night during the election time. Fellow GOPers, it is time we take back our country from this political class who are selling this great country that we love and cherish for peanuts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb should be a gentlemen and back out. No Clinton, no Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well of course Establishment Republican Krauthammer is going to throw cold water on Trumps success. Hes an anal and bitter fucking cripple who is pissed that Jeb Bush isnt leading in the polls. I wonder if he can even tell when he involuntarily shits himself sitting in that wheelchair as he is spewing his cynical horseshit that turns out to be wrong 99.9% of the time! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
oh please, jeb bush leading in this poll? man, if this twat is selected for republican candidate, i wont be going out to vote. id rather vote for carly fiorina than jeb bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP SAID SOMETHING REASONABLE OMG <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Trump, we should deport the criminal gangs first. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump wont be as tough as he likes to sound. Jeb Bush is more likely to be tough and has learned plenty from both his father and older brother. Not that Im a Jeb fan. But Trump is gonna make a lot of trouble if he becomes President. Hell have to play ball with the shadow gov or hell never be anything but a loud mouth billionaire. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
jeb bush 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Roger Ailes, coming to Megyns defense after that blatant character assassination attempt shows just how far he is willing to go to smear a persons character in the name of ratings and assuring that Jeb Bush is the front runner, at least in Foxs point of view. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shes still sitting at about 55% in national polls for the democratic nomination. I dont think she has too much to worry about. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
megyn kelly is a bimbo, not a journalist. fire her from Fox news. Trump for the WIN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fake ass conservative Meghan tries to bait Christy creme against trump but he goes after jeb Bush instead lol. Fox news using Kelley as an instigator but it isnt working. Fox is all about the political Elite, and cant stand an outsiders exposing the dysfunctional political system we have. shame on you Fox! time to cut ties. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

REPUBLICANS what are you thinking?? Jeb Bush a RINO establishment puppet...DONALD TRUMP certainly cant be trusted...BEN CARSON will make a tremendous President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush has a descent camera presence. However, can we entrust the most powerful country in the world in the hands of a mommas boy who has never endured hardship and never earned a dime on his own ? Nothing against affluent people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its been entertaining to watch all these past months how Donald Trump has amused us with speeches and stupid and impossible plans for America. He WONT be our president. its going to be Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton. Everything has been chosen by NWO. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if Donald Trump removes all the illegal aliens from the United States of America how is he going to find his next fucking wife? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Bush is for the civil liberties of people that are here illegally and not offending the country that let them pass in here illegally? What a spineless moron. Jeb, just drop out. Least W had some stones. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
kraughthammer looks like the Grinch.Just cant take him seriously. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carsons message resonates to people on both sides of the aisle. Not a divider, but a uniter. Truly presidential. I would love to see a CarsonCruz ticket or vice versa <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You remember what happened to romney..lol..He will never be elected..ruining the republicans chances of gaining the white house..lol...he is talking about breaking the 14th amendment..This dude is a psychopath german nazi whos parents were immigrants.haha..what a maroon..BernieRand paul 2016! rep need to break away from this ignoramus before he ruins what they have worked for.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is the GOP that is dividing this country. Jeb Bush will never become president. He is too weak and incompetent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bad policy will yield bad results. Jeb Bush He should tell that to his father and brother. In fact, Id go one step further and say bad families will yield bad candidates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would rather trump be president at least hes telling it like it is unlike that lying bitch Hilary or that criminal family member jeb bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am so proud of Donald Trump. He has courage to prove his critics dead wrong. for example many have claimed him to be a racist against brown skinned Mexicans or antwomen, at least the ones who are menstruating. So I was thrilled when the Trump campaign announced they will prove he is not. Next Friday at the Atlanta campaign rally Donald will appear with a menstruating Mexican Lesbian who will sodomize him on stage with a 18 inch strap on!!!!! Top that Jeb Bush..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush has NO passion. We dont need another Bush, its the last thing we can have, as well as another Clinton. Its time to stand and LEAD again! To be respected again! Donald Trump is a true leader, he has the passion and the ideas to lead the country to where it should be. Bush can use all his puppet money on negative ads all he wants, it cant match what Trump will unleash on him. #TRUMP2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol Jeb Bush. What a joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is neither a republican nor a democrat. From his own words it would seem most likely he is a nationalist...one who belives in the greatness of America and taking care of America and American citizens 1st. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only thing I dont understand is why Jeb Bush has any support at all. I would choose literally any other candidate over Jeb, and see no difference whatsoever between him and Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol why is Fox even talking about Jeb Bush? Who cares about Jeb freaking Bush. NO ONE wants a Bush as president again. Lol Fox News looks out of touch with the nation. Listen to the people Fox and stop pushing your behind the scenes agenda. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a republican and I dont know anybody voting for Jeb Bush <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump knows how to run America the right way. Wussy Jeb wants to give more free money to leeches as illegals by using your tax money. Wussy Jeb is like Rick Perry by giving better things to illegals than Americans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hillary clinton is a sociopath. hillary for jail 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You can tell? Fox News, Evil Karl Rove, MSNBC, CBS, Gay CNN, and so on are working together to pick the winners as Wussy Jeb BushHillary or another greedy Republican for Fox News. You have learn the propaganda lies by Lying Fox News or Lib News. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Both Jeb Bush and Clinton suck. We dont need another establishment corporate sell out politician running the White House. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is the only guy who can successfully fight ISIS..When hes elected hes going to go over there and BORE them to death..We need another Bush in the White house like i need a dose of the Clap <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I admire what my brother has done for the world <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im an independent voter and would vote for Trump only. If Trump is not the republican nominee, I will not vote. Its clear to me that hillary clinton cant be trusted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb loves it, he doesnt have to face any scrutiny for months while this clown sucks up media attention. Fox News knows this and theyre happy to comply. Theyre all in the tank for Jeb, hes the elites chosen puppet. In a pinch theyll take Hillary of course, they bought em both just to be safe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God bless Cpl. Carpenter and I thank him and honor his service. That said, Jeb Bush does not have my primary vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Is this a conundrum for Fox News? They like Jeb Bush but Jeb does not have the charisma of the Donald... Greta puts on Jeb ... but no one cares and few even watched, there was a Major League ball game that started at the same time... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb bush is weak, he wont close that border..i live in florida and jebs a typical bush and republican..only for the rich class..and the rich class wants cheap mexican labor so they can keep wages down and make much higher profits.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the Kelly file? i guess the name FOX Propaganda Whore was already taken. The Republican field looks more Communist than the Democrat field if that is even possible. Welcome to the United Socialists of America. USA USA USA USA . Sideshow Don will make America great again with his clown hair. Bernie Sanders has lots of free candy for you, all you have to do is get in his van. Hitlery Clinton, need i say more. Jeb Bush is a globalist testicle rash as is the rest of the field. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate to say it but Jeb Bush looks like hes the underdog in the family trying to prove something think he might get shit done but the others messages are weak <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I learn whats wrong with America? You have the many evils destroying America, and the American people within itself.

Jeb Bush puppet, im sure daddy Bush and brother Bush said we were both president now get your ass out there and you become president also so we can be the three generations that helped fuck up the USA <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont understand people who say Bernie cant win so theyre going to vote for Hillary. He can win if you vote for him in the primary, if he doesnt win the primary THEN you vote for Hillary. Although personally, Id almost rather vote for Trump or even Jeb Bush than Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant believe Id ever say, I agree with Jeb bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is frightening because hes more eloquent than his brother and more genuine than his father. Hes a real threat to get elected. The only person who would be worse his Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Jeb Bush!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He makes so much sense its scary. We need a guy thats in on the system. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am not a republican but getting to know more about Jeb Bush, for us Latinos I think he would be the best option as a republican candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would vote for Jeb Bush before Id ever vote for Donald Duck <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Let me ask you, do you want this loon running this country? Id vote for Jeb Bush before I even considered voting for this idiot... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This whole debate was a joke, everything from the moderators to Jeb Bushs beady soulless robot eyes. Many of the issues that matter most to so many are simply not mentioned. Also, they seem to be so sure that Hillary will be winning the dem nominee... God forbid you mention Bernie. The only thing im worried about is when the Establishment figures out they cant beat him and do him like they did RFK. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A Bush against invading Iraq????? I dont know. You can probably count the number of Republicans with one hand who thought the Iraq invasion was a bad idea. I hope Bernie Sanders puts Jeb to the test before Hillary wins the nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stupid Lying Bush. The Bush dynasty has caused more damage to the US image and brought more cause to ISIS antiAmerican Ideals. Only way this wet towel Jeb can fix his families image is to acknowledge his brothers HUGE mistakes in our foreign policy as well as our domestic financial disaster under his watch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Of course Blakeman is going to say Perry is finished....hes a Jeb Bush front man and hes gleeful that Perry is going down so Bush can hopefully pick up 1 or 2 of Perrys 3 supporters. Newsflash Bush is only still in the race because of money....not because of supporters. Bushs campaign is on the rocks as well. the base wont vote for establishment candidates...he has no chance in the general election as the base will stay home like they did for Romney. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand kicked Trumps ass. You know how I can tell? Look at all the whiny tweets and comments trying to defend Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I live in Kentucky...Rand Paul aint did shit for Kentucky...Fuck rand and his daddy...Fox news is trying to bash trump out of the race by using republicans who is low in the polls to challenge trump...while Jeb Bush sits and wAits...its 2015 Fox news not 1951 you cant feed this new generation with bullshit propaganda trying to help your buddy win!!! #trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a debate! And here we go with the distractions again. Megyn Kelly was a real piece of work, asking National Enquirer type questions during a national debate. But I guess she has to do what her handlers tell her to do. I didnt see any tough questions for Jeb who was front runner just three weeks ago. No tough questions on immigration for Bush? The whole thing is a massive song and dance..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
screw you jeb bush and megyn kelly <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
doug sounds like hes gargling cum when he speaks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

WHO? Fox News! in its attempt to merge Mexico with USA by supporting Jeb Bush <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No questions about Ted Creepy Cruzs Canadian birth certificate, but chastising Trump for Rosie ODonnell insults. Huh? Given Rick Perry and Jeb Bushs intellectual minimalism, Kelly should have asked Dubya brother if he shared a bowl of lead paint chips with cousin Ricky. How many times was Randy Paul bitchslapped? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No more Bushes! No more Clintons! Jebidumbass the Third is a lying piece of shit! Do not believe anything he says! Hillary and Jeb are just NWO puppets, vote for anyone but them! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We should also be demanding the emails from other government employees that have used private email servers, and have not released all of their emails. Jeb Bush Scott Walker Colin Powell Chris Christie Bobby Jindal Marco Rubio Rick Perry Those of ewe that did not know this need to quit listening to echo chamber news sources. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah Trump wrecked her, but nobody will vote for a fascist megalomaniac. If that is what Americans want... then prepare for nuclear war Same goes for Clinton voters. You wanna vote Clinton? Then prepare for nuclear war.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is bloviating about school choice. As President he would do the same thing that his brother Bush 43 did and that was sacrifice school choice and school vouchers in order to write an education plan, No child left behind, with the likes of Teddy Kennedy the Liberal of the Senate! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush answers perfectly. We need a pro life president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really like Jeb Bush. He talks and acts just like the U.S. President to be. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has tons of money....if he becomes the president then he will be the only president that cant be brought over with money......i think america needs a guy like that <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I thought george bush was the dumbest president i stand corrected jeb is a complete dumbazz. Your brother fucked up the ecomomy an couldnt even create jobs. Obama got healthcare for ppl as well as boosted jobs. Yall dumb azz republicans are the ones fuckin up the country but as soon as someone wants to make things equal for all sides yall start black balling an blasting smh. One nation under god smh at least with obamas debt he created jobs an got healthcare WTF did bush do??? Ill wait <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is by far the most qualified Republican candidate. The reason why Democrats hate him is because he is a Bush! Bush, Sr. was cool, Bush 43 sucked balls and ruined the party, but Jeb is very straight forward, has a plan, calm, and answers questions. Jeb! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I was on the fence before the debate but Trump now has my vote. I also really like Carson and Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is a Fucking Moron , it was a legit Question and no I am no liberal .I hope Ted Cruz wins, Scott Walker was ask a question about abortion he didnt crumble under like Trump did. Trump is to used to people kissing his ass almost all of Fox News is riding this guys dick . So this bitch has nothing to cry about , Jeb Bush was ask about several things he didnt cry They all were ask tough questions Trump is the only one who crumbled under the pressure. VOTE TED CRUZ 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Electing George W. Bush was a mistake and hopefully my fellow Americans wont make that stupid mistake electing little Jeb. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sounds like Megyn Kelly, Erick Erickson and probably Jeb Bush are trying to thwart Democracy and gang up on Trump in a very concerted effort by the extremely hostile remarks she made designed to embarrass Trump. There will be a massive backlash for their efforts by the people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is bought out by special interests and lobbyists. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If Donald Trump is elected president I strongly encourage ALL liberals to move to Canada. Only then will we finally see that Conservatism works and Liberalism is the cancer in America. Even Canada will eventually get tired of you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fox News Sucks. The very fact that this video is on Fox News channel is proof that they want a POS like Jeb Bush and not a strong leader like Trump. FUCK FOX NEWS. John Stewart is 100% right on this garbage TV station. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am disappointed in Fox news you stooped to the level of liberal media you were not fair in your questions to the candidates. You sugar coated Jeb Bushs questions and baited Donalds questions. Mega Kelly I lost my respect for you last night you are wearing the clothes of a conservative but really a liberal. Your show will never get my support again <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who is this cunt ragging on Trump for not kissing that Megyn bitchs ass? This is the real problem........these people want him to be one of these politically correct ass kissers.

Jeb Bush is full of s when he ran Florida he turned it into crap it is crap in Florida crap complete crap everything is crappy in Florida jobs wages everything everything... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I see a lot of commentators down on Bush. Not sure why, he did just fine last night. You had Kasich that improved his standing, and then a few that looked silly, mean or confused, but Jeb was happy in the middle. I think those 30something aggressive types are looking for the quick zinger to propel or destroy a candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im fairly certain that if there is an illuminati then Clinton will be president. Jeb will just be in it to keep the Bush name going, but the next Bush as Presidentand there will be will be Jebs half hispanic son. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think they should abolish the stupid primary elections and let everyone run in 2016. That way we dont have to be stuck with two crappy choices. People shouldnt be forced to vote between the lesser of the two evils. If its between Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush, I am not voting again in 2016. I cant stand either one of them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is the first time Im hearing Jeb Bush speak, nothing new here, same old sneaky Bush family snake oil salesman. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I cannot believe the Trump supporters. Do you people understand what he said here? He said that single payer would have worked in America fifteen years ago. He didnt say it was a mistake to support it, he said he was right to support single payer then. That makes no sense. How can so many conservatives support this man? Especially when there are better candidates! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush bragging about education is really ironic. Voters in FL voted for smaller class sizes, something Bush opposed. Bush was caught saying he had devious plans for handling the matter if it passed. He not only chose dollars over education, but was outright caught saying he intended to do what he wanted, not what the voters voted for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why the Fuck is Jeb bush running when he has a FALONY ?????????????? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush, Im sorry you do not get my vote Trump does as a Republican or Independant. Everything you said, is political speak and not a shred of honesty. You have a huge conflict of interest sleeping with you every night. So, why should I believe you when you claim youll do something in favor of Americans? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It wasnt a mistake. It was deliberate. Your goofy brother wanted to be a war president, and the war profiteering NEOcons, surrounding him, wanted their WAR BUCKS, so the United States invaded Iraq. THE WAR PROFITEERS KNEW making Iraq safe for democracy was an absurd idea. So what if it resulted in many thousands of deaths, cost the taxpayers a trillion, and destabilized the entire Middle East. Youll still GRIN a big GRIN, wont you Jeb! ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think I just witnessed the first death blow being delivered to political correctness in America, and it was very enjoyable to watch. . Good on you, Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who really cares what Jeb Bush thinks about tone? Hes tone deaf to the country like all establishment Republicans. And Wallace is such a lib doofer. Its clear Fox is so establishment Republican. These guys really fear Trump will tip over theyre little world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everything he said here is absolutely right. It wasnt smart to go into Iraq But it also wasnt smart to pull out of Iraq in quick haste. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We dont need another Bush, especially this one! The Freudian slip here is telling. Its NOT..its our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. Jeb doesnt really believe America has the right to choose who comes in. If its an act of love for those who come in, he doesnt think we have a right to interfere. Sorry buddy, thats not how border control works, thats not how a nation controls its borders, thats not how America works. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is a fucking moron.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It would be hilarious if he ends up being the republican nominee because hes the one whos taking all their spotlight. Still I think Bernie is more honest and I would rather see him become the next president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush seems even more retarded than his idiot brother. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When I look at Jeb Bush, I feel like he doesnt really want to run for President. I feel like he was pressured to run by his family and hes just doing it because his brother did it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Megyn kelly works for Jeb Bush, gave him easy and the most questions...and he still did not deliver. This guy makes his brother look like Einstein <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush is a Liar and a Fucking Pussy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Red flags go off in my mind every time I hear Jeb Bush speak. His response are too rehearsed and polished. He talk out of both sides of his mouth and like Hillary will say anything to get a vote. America deserves better. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb, it is time for you to go and look after your dad, hes getting old. Even your own mother says no more Bushs or Clintons. You have no fire, no spark. Its time for business man to give it a shot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

His answer made no fucking sense. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush represents Reagans normalice, except for his Irak views. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I despise Jeb with a passion! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump brings a refreshing nonpolitical aspect to the debate, and so did Carson. But Trump has a good record of success, hes well stocked, hes got plans and can put up a fight in Congress. I think he can protect my rights as well as his most precious assets, so yeah, Id vote him in. I dont think someone could reason me out of that quite yet anyway. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Horrible debate should have called it the Trump roast hour Thought Fox would have been fair but sadly like all big business media they were not. Trump was asked personal questions others were asked policy question. BTW at this point Americans deserve their fate for putting up with big business, media and lobby control...

Its obvious the people behind the media dont want Trump to get into office. Well, he has my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If Jeb didnt have the last name Bush he would be in last place, he has the personality and charisma of a house plant. The GOP needs people with energy and enthusiasm not some lame duck banking on his last name, aside from Trump I like Walker and Christie but the rest are duds. Carson seems like a sincere guy but lacks energy and enthusiasm, he will be left in the back because of it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We dont want Fox News greedy Republicans. Thats for sue. To me, two face Mccain is no war hero but a fake. Also Wussy Jeb Bush chicken out of the war too. Why? Because Wussy Jeb is a sissy like his sissy brother George Wussy Bush. Trump knows how to run America the right way. The greedy Republicans are not going to help Americans like phony Rick Perry, and Sissy Jeb. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Everyone thought that Jeb Bush would be the strongest in the race? Everyone? I have never met anyone who thought he would be a strong candidate. Only pundits on TV have been pushing for his inevitable victory, in the same way they pushed for Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton back in 2008. The Bush name may come with a lot of support from big donors, but it is not popular among the populace. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The American people was dying on our borders and Wussy Bush couldnt care less. Wussy Bush even let a illegal come in America with drugs on him without arresting him to testify against border agent by protecting our borders. So that border agent had to go to prison by Wussy Bush. Know thy evil....the greedy Republicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Now JEB BUSH is bragging! So he is bragging about being the Lords servant who knew his master was shrewd and buried his money in the ground and did nothing with it ! Amazing ! people are dumb ...lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Two things here. 1 since so much has been made of Obamas name, will the same concern over Bobbys real name arise? Just what is his name on his birth certificate and drivers license? and 2 just what was in his resume that he shouldve become governor of Louisiana? News is that he has the lowest approval rating of all governors in the US, the second being Christie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey Fox News , wheres the story about how the former Polish speaker of the house had to resign because he got caught saying antiAmerican things and then Jeb Bush going to visit him the day after and call him a friend of America? Just wondering why I couldnt find that story on any of your sites <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FOX NEWS is one of the best things that exists for the Democratic Party! It is also good for improving race relations... They are so ridiculous in their delivery and combativeness and aggressive stances against acceptance of race, progress and democratic views that it forces people to look in the mirror and ask... Do I really believe this crap?.. Thank you FOX news!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush Oil Millionaire Would Pollute The Environment, and Destroy All Life On Earth, Including Human Life. Jeb Bush is a Oil Millionaire who puts making money above Human Life.

I am a conservative. I have a problem with Huckabee because he supported the child molester josh duggars. If we want to beat Hillary we have to pull in independents. We can not do that with a hard core conservative. Our best bet is Rubio. They are afraid of him ! He has good values , a great story, it is time to elect a younger man. They have to live in the mess the older generation has made. By the way, I am not young! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hilary Clintons finished. Apparently she used her government email account to email her friend asking her if the shops had enough asparagus in store, as she was hosting a dinner party. Yes you may accuse fox of being petty yet again like the bengahzi affair, but if it wasnt for shows like the five then these crucial snippets of information would never have reached the American people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a lifelong Republican, I intend to vote against Jeb at every republican primary that I can. Republicans have had enough of these Democrat Liberal Bush family members. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb is bad news. His father George Sr was a good guy. His brother Bush Jr was a failure as president not much different that BHO. No matter how he dances around it, Jeb favors illegal immigrants and Common Core. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox News and the greedy Republicans wont let Rand Paul win the white house. Fox News and the greedy Republicans wants Evil Jeb Bush to win the white house. Wait and see. It will be daja vu again. Fox News are sneaky liars and they only serve the rich or greedy companies. Not Americans. Also read 1984 George Orwell book. It will explain a lot of trues about Fox News and other News media by molding your thinking. Fox News is very good as sneaky liars. I have to say that about them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Breaking News! Fox News. It looks like Evil Jeb is getting BOO everywhere he goes. I bet that burns Fox News and the Bush lovers. The best part on Fox Nation? The Bush lovers was squealing like pigs. When Romney lost.........lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush would make a fine running mate for Hilary Clinton. Their positions are very complimentary of each other. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The right will lose again if they dont get begin Jeb bush lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is the only one that can sway moderates and obtain the youth vote. If they give the nomination to Jeb or Ted then they will essentially be handing the presidency to the dems. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Left is shitting their collective pants about Walker. They are shaking with fear. They attack and attack and attack and he only grows more popular due to those attacks. He is the real deal. Scott Walker is the crafty Roadrunner and the Leftist traitors within this nation are the hapless coyote! LOL!! Go ahead, nominate the old hag you miserable yellow cowards....you are gonna lose in 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I want Jeb Bush to win! This will be our next president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

NOT VOTING FOR ANOTHER BUSH, ESPECIALLY ONE NAMED FREAKIN JEB <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is a perfect example of the weak, effeminate liberal male. His head is so full of illusions and he believes the lies he tells us. He has no foreign and constantly gets outmaneuvered by Russia and China. And even with the media, academia, labor unions and the entirety of the federal govt claiming he is a success people can still see through the facade and classify him as a failure. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This gives me hope that if I lie about using a private email server to the public I can still have the possibility of being nominated. Oh wait, thats a benefit only the democrats can afford, but for how long? I hope Jeb Bush, Hillary, and Bernie get swept under the rug. Ben Carson seems to be a good pick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Too many Americans are seemingly driven by celebrity hype! He hosted a successful TV show, but that doesnt warrant him as the next friggn president for Heavens sake. However, hes a FAR BETTER candidate choice than ... God forbid ... either Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush. Its all so corrupt anyway ... so whats the point??? South Africa <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We should also be demanding the emails from other government employees that have used private email servers, and have not released all of their emails. Jeb Bush Scott Walker Colin Powell Chris Christie Bobby Jindal Marco Rubio Rick Perry Those of ewe that did not know this need to quit listening to echo chamber news sources. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Rick Santorum, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, George Pataki, Donald Trump, Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal AND Scott Walker they all running for president. Now the Republicans will have to decide which one of these men can lead the Republicans to another CRUSHING DEFEAT. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Obama will go down as one of the WORST! Presidents in History! Starting more illegal Wars, Bank bail outs to no end, Lying to the American People. Hes everything Nixon wished he could be.

God bless Obama. The republican party hatred of him is rooted in racism, pure unadulterated racism, and Id be surprised if they dont try to impeach him. Marco Rubio made a fool of himself when he reacted with such knee jerk reaction to Obamas surprise move on Cuba. I guess hes worried about losing the next election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I dont want the military going to die for another countrys problems. This is on the offense, we are only supposed to fight on the defense. How many more americans do you want to die? This is wrong on so many levels, we are not responsible for them and our federal government funded ISIS in the beginning, this shows what this kind of intervention creates. Stop with this now or more of our brothers, sisters, fathers, and mothers will die. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I feel sorry for the more sane Republicans who are trying to shed the racistbigot image which loses them votes with minorities. Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are starting to look better all the time.

Hahaha! I hope he doesnt swallow a colostomy bag thinking it is cotton candy! He is useful as a way to rid the neighborhood of skunks.

I so glad CNN is using Jeb Bush to lower their ratings. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald Trump learned nothing from John McCain who lost to Barack Obama because he was a war hawk and the economy was going in the drains.

Donald Trump doesnt care if he louses or wins, his still going to make a profit out of it, his more of a poppet business man, his trying to move voters to Jeb Bush even if he denys it, taking voters away from Hillary Clinton. Give me a break sanctions to poor countrys to pay for immigrants deportation, maybe a middle east scenario to come. its not about political questions, its about been realistic, his just giving short answer like a politicians. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a menace to society... Send Jeb Bush in his time machine to KILL BABY TRUMP before he goes Full Retard. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think that Jeb Bush and Ben Carson are making more sense in their speaking. AN this is good thing as they still have more to say in substance. Trump is already exhausted. Trumps poll number will keep falling because he has not future coarse. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

God damn conservatives are so stupid <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The woman doing the voiceover sounds like a bar slut who smokes 4 packs a day. Trump is right, the media are scum. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
just in case everyone doesnt understand what Marco Rubio is doing he is intentionally muddying the waters to make it tougher for the voting constituencies to be able to tell the difference between himself and Ted Cruz but as I said we all know whos the conservative and who is the liberal Republican Marco Rubio is jeb Bushs boy hes his conservative blocker <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio in Cruz agree on legal immigration. also Rubio seeing the mood of the voter is trying to be more like Cruz not the other way around Rubio is the new standard bearer for the moderates now that Jeb Bush is no longer viable as a presidential candidate. the truth is if you want to Linguinis find moderate to liberal Republican Marco Rubios your man if you want a hardcore real conservative Ted Cruz your man Ted Cruz 2016 Ted Cruz. Org Ted Cruz. org <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hey jeb if you would be prepared to kill the baby hitler, what about his collaborators who supplied him with money and materials for war like your famous family member Prescot bush? your family made its wealth supplying hitler so this vid made me wet myself with laughter that this moron would be dumb enough to even mention such an email being sent to him let alone answering the question in view of his family history...dumber and dumber! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THE BUSH FAMILY HAVE BEEN MURDERERING BABIES FOR A CENTURY AND AS YOU CAN SEE JEB IS NOT THE BLACK SHEEP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Jeb Bush would kill an innocent baby. Wonder if he would kill anyone else if he could go back in time. Truly spoken like a NWO puppet, where the end justifies the means. These are evil days that we are living in. What a STUPID question and what an ignorant answer. If a person could go back in time. Why would they not wait for a pivotal moment in Hitlers life and lead him down the right path. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

JEB, shortsighted once again.

Google How Bushs grandfather helped Hitlers rise to power <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Let the prolife crowd know that Jeb Bush is a baby killer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Anyone believing Trump has been positioned as a viable candidate is being sorely duped.

If Rubio is elected president he might actually beat GWB in the number of days vacation he takes. GWB took a total of 879 days vacation. GWB, his first year in office, he took a month long vacation before 911. GWB was on vacation when Hurricane Katrina struck. This is what youre going to get with Rubio, Jeb Bush, and maybe Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton was back on the campaign trail the next day after her 11hour Benghazi testimony. Thats commitment.

Truth is that when we age physically we dont really feel that much different in our mind than when we were younger. Maybe our minds mature and become more wise and less passionate but we still feel young, at least from our mind perspective, not the body.

No, JEB, its not ONLY about what he did after the event, it is also about what he should have done or tried to do before the event.G.W.Bush had ample warning for 9 long months, now he perhaps wouldnt have been able to thwart those attacks even if he had tried his hardest, but the truth is he Didnt try. While he wasnt to be blamed for the attacks, since the WTC came down on his watch, NO, he didnt keep anyone safe either. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This guys is an idiot. He fell right into Donald Trumps trap. The more he continues to go on and on and on about how his brother kept us safe, the more he will continue to dig a deep hole for himself. Hes done! Hes going to need to drop out of the race soon.

Republican party think we are all kindergarden kids who believed Bush kept us safe after 911. What Jeb was saying Bush wasnt the preisdent until 911 happen! Giving Bush the benefit of doubt about 911 but he went after Saddan instead of Bin Laden and sent another 5.000 US soldiers to dies in their bogus war. No matter how to judge it. ISIS creation was all because of Bush...so how safe your brother kept us now! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush why so many bushs are candidate, Bush War <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Come on! We know why GW Bush had it out for Saddam. He was angry because Saddam threatened to kill his father so he had a personal vendetta. By the way, Jeb likes to slam Trump on his info gathering, where did GW get his info from on weapons of mass destruction? Maybe GW should have watched the news channels like Trump does, we might not have had a 2nd Iraq invasion and his father couldnt finish the job the first time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look, 911 happened during Bush presidency. fU JEB <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Coincidence? Old bush .. Desert storm vs saddam . Bush jr... 911 vs saddam what did I do now .... Jeb!!!!! .... Let think of something and make money, maybe saddam has a clone and has a built in Weapon of mass destruction. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush Your brother was so WEAK and ineffective 911 happened. W. ignored intelligence, and even after the towers fell, did nothing to HALT muslim immigration. The Boston Marathon bombers came in on his watch. Iraq was destabilized, Iran became more powerful. BOTTOM LINE, YOUR BROTHER DID NOT KEEP US SAFE. SUCH A SHITTY PREZ, WE ELECTED OBAMA. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush just said Republican voters are dumb. Oh the lols! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why do we have even elections? Oh to give the dumbed down sheeple the illusion of freedom. Barry Bush had his turn on the throne and now it is Jebs turn. I dont know if Trump is kin to the Queen but you must be blood related to be President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jakes actually on point with the comparison. Numerous reports prior to 911 warning about OBL were ignored by Bush, just as calls for security were ignored by Clinton. Jeb is the type of indoctrinated pol that we need to get rid of, not elect. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush is a corporate owned sleazebag. We NEVER should have another Bush in the White House. I really am beginning to dislike the Bush family. They are a bunch of power hungry religious fundies.

Wow CNN, you are quite pathetic, A anyone with a pulse can tell thats a fraud and B if you look under her Linked in Profile under current employment, it says intern for Jeb Bush Campaign....pathetic CNN, pathetic.

About the same pay and same job as man question just make her show she is actually an idiot. Trump answered wisely. The whole Clinton family should be in jail with Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush shows his little girl panties macho as his surrogate ambushes Trump at a Rino event in New Hampshire. She will slut her body if she wishes, but if she allows herself to be impregnated, the new life within her is not hers, and therefore if she stops it she commits murder.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Whoever made this news clip needs to be fired for false advertisement, bias reporting, and an attempt to slander by use of other forms of media as well as using the false title to slander his name. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Do you ever notice how people hates Jeb just because he is a Bush?the prejudice is so real. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doctor Carson is an amazing, intelligent, honest and fearless individual. I think hes a fantastik person in every sense of the word but in all honesty, Id rather see him as VP for a president Rubio or Jeb Bush. I may seem blunt...but after almost 8 years of this Obamanation Abomination in the White House, I would not like to see another A.A. prez right now. Nobama has spoilt it for me. I know I may get backlash for this comment but I thats how I feel right now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont you believe it. Jeb Bush wins the nomination, Trump runs as a 3rd party so his buddies the clintons get the white house. Dont doubt me!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush used to dress up as Hitler and pay prostitutes to shit in his mouth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lmao the Russian government trolls work fast af. 17 dislikes and the video hasnt even been up for that long <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hitler was a socialist. Big Government is horrible for all countries. This is America home of the free...not home of the slaves to Big Government country. People need to stop sponging off the Government which is really sponging off the hard working tax payers forced by democrats to give government all theyre money so they can give that money to people that refuse to work. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Of course he dropped out. The new contender is from Florida Jeb Bushs state. Give you one guess which Republican Candidate they intend to support. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im proud of my brother Jeb Bush 2015 Any fucking retard voting for that POS related to the war criminal called George W. Bush needs to headbutt a fucking knife. What a disgrace to humanity that cunts like him can smile at the camera and say they are proud of their sibling who is responsible for deaths, displacement and devastation of millions of Iraqis as well as the deaths of thousands of his fellow country men. America, you are better than this. Dont vote this scum into office. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There is no good Democrats running....so Im not watching the democrat debate. Bernie is a crazy socialist and Hilarry is a lying fool. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Initially, I didnt take him seriously, but after reading Bush III tax proposal, Ive decided against him as Jebs tax ideas will be catastrophic for the middle class. But after listening to Trump and his common sense thoughts, Ive decided Donald is my man. I still dont like his style, but he can learn. I know America doesnt need another career politician to lead us, but yes it needs a man who wont do it for money and who speaks clearly and knows a good deal vs. a bad deal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its a shame, I think jeb bush could do better than his dad brother but they messed up to much for him. He guilty by association. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When Jebs parents die there will be two less demons walking the face of the Earth. P.O.S. Archons. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio sweats too much and Jeb is a wimp.....Go Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everybody knows George Bush messed up in Iraq big time. Jeb Bush cant say that. And thats why he avoids answering such questions...and theats why he is unfit to be president. The last thing the country needs is another Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump and Jeb Bush are probably the only candidates that can be picked. Scott Walker is not a viable option to me and nor really is Carly Fiorina <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
JEB Bush said it best. Rubio is the rights barrack obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
do not put another criminal Clinton back into the white house. that will bring the head of the crime family along with her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb bush is a idiot, he should learn to control his crack smoking daughter stupid CUCK, I love Trump his family looks ALL American can you imagine jeb bush ugly family and his midget illegal third world wife standing next to Trumps beautiful family, Ivanka malenia etc, i bet he would look so pathetic and defeated, Jeb bush is a cuck <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Well as an equal response jeb BUSH can role out his brother GW from the republican side as a good reminder of the past what to more of look forward to as well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush smiles when he is mad. Nice smile <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its either Trump, Bush or Rubio. I dont see anyone else getting the support they need to win the nomination. I dont think anyone is interested in another Bush presidency. Rubio is a smart guy, but hes really hyper and young and it shows. I think, unless some craziness happens at the upcoming debates, Trump will win the nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its apologize for Her, u idiot lol... jeb bush is a fool that wants too keep u.s.a. going like a POS like it right now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Disgusting. Dispicable. George W. Bush created ISIS by liberating Iraq. Jeb, your brother failed so abysmally on the war on terror. If your brother really wanted to defeat terrorism he wouldve stayed well away from Iraq. But he didnt. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Frank Rich is an IDIOT!! People are tired of Political Correctness, theyre tired of Politics as Usual... They want Plain Truth and Common Sense, and Someone that Actually Does Their Job! Someone that actually speaks for the American People, and Jeb Bush aint it, nor any Democrat! Carley is another Hillary, and when it comes down to it, Cruz would make a great VP for Trump, Huckabee as an advisor, Gowdy as AG! The rest are government overreach as usual... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im Canadian and a Liberal Trump isnt as bad as Jeb Bush who defended his brothers war on Iraq while his father gave Saddam the keys to the city of Detroit, and his father gave Saddam tacit approval to invade Kuwait.

Jeb Bush, more energy? Only when hes falling like a rock in the polls. Jeb Bushs desperation is hanging all over him. Its pathetic. And Scott Walker is the same kettle of fish.

We now know why Donald Trump says Jeb Bush has low energy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump lost the claim that Jeb Bush is a puppet of special interests. Jeb Bush turned down Trumps request for Casinos in Florida. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How come no one is outraged at Trump calling Jeb Bushs wife a slut? How come no one, even Bush, not catch that?I hear your wife is a lovely woman. Trump said. That is the most subtle way and oldest trick in the book to call a woman a slut without being explicit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Something im surprised this expert missed.... When bush gave trumph the low five.. He got super excited... You could see it in his enthusiasm with the smack and his facial expressions directly afterwards... He seemed like a child who had been seeking the approval of daddy and finally got it..... My guess is he has been feeling like an outcast and was becoming insecure about himself... Review the high five if you dont believe me on the body language <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush supports Common Core education. A dumbing down of a nation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Now matter what side of the political fence you reside on, I believe Jeb Bush effectively torpedoed any chance of a presidential bid with his remarks on national security. According to Bush, the United States was SAFER during Ws Administration than during Obamas Administration. No one in their right mind should say that with confidence. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How awkard was this!!!! Trumps totally normal and jeb is like that weird special ed kid in school....hes giggling like a 5yr old....its as if bush wants to be cool and accepted by trump so when trump gave him a thumbs up bush got alllll excited...slaps his hand abundantly hard as he squints, and giggles and acts totally babyish. Bush??? Oh hellllll naw!!! Trump is a mans man....TOTAL ALL AMERICAN ALPHAMALE TRUMPS RIGHT....THESE POLITICIANS REALLY ARE STUPID AF!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is a nerd! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a Trump supporter and I wanted to hear what Trump would say about marijuana! Rand gave a great answer. Jeb admits to smoking pot recreationally, but says he voted AGAINST medical pot for people who are suffering and NEED it!!! What an asshole!!! Wow. One more reason that we dont need another Bush. And Chris Christie... saying he would enforce federal marijuana laws in Colorado... are you kidding me? Chris Christie get off the stage, fool. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have noticed Gay CNN voided the questions to Jeb Bush as a flip flopper in Iraq. Man the lying News media buried that quick. These questions are plan out and these phonies have time to practice their acting skills to the American people. I learn Rand Paul is a fake Constitution person with Kim D. in KY. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How the hek Bush kept us safe? when the biggest terrorist attack happen in his watch. He then made war with Iraq that had nothing to do with the attackers, they were Egyptians not Iraqi ans. Jeb Bush said nothing about his other brother that was in charge of security on the twin towers.blah blah blah... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They should of ask to Jeb how much blood money did he and his family made by Wussy Bushs lying war? The funny part Fag Obama just pardon George Wussy Bush for his war crimes. It was a inside job by the evil Bush family to pardon George Wussy Bush. You can bet Fag Obama will be pardon for his war crimes too by the Next President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Both Jeb Bush and his brother seem like guys you wish you could invite to your barbecue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so who do you think was the winner? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush keep us safe? Has everyone just lost their minds? Bush gave us 911 and started two wars. He made us less safe and Obama keep up the Bush Doctrine. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is the only one bringing logic, rationality and real economics to these debates, which arent debates at all. Theyre American Idol contests. The presidential race is a circus, and its only purpose now is to drown out any real voices for individual and economic liberty like Rand Paul and distract you long enough to have the lowinformation voters vote in another corrupt establishment candidate like Jeb Bush or Hitlery Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

typical Rolling Stone magazine story putting their own spin on a news story. look at that face remark by donald trump spun into being a sexist remark. yes, look at that face, as if the way a person looks doesnt influence votes. donald trump said that rick perry wasnt very bright. donald trump said that jeb bush was low energy. if rick perry or jeb bush were female both remarks would have been called sexist too <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I gave thumbs up just cause I do like the things trump says. But on the other hand can he pulled off everything he talks to put our country back to becoming a great nation. I pay for em all.

Jeb insults Americans and actually thinks he has a chance to win the presidency. I would vote for Stalin before I would vote for that jerk. Why doesnt he speak Arabic next? What about Russian or Chinese? Trump is married to a foreign lady but doesnt insult America by speaking his wifes language of orgin. I took two years of formal Spanish but what Jeb speaks is slang garbage. That is what the ignornant Mexicans speak. High Spanish is spoken by the rich educated Mexicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is a narcistic racist, sexist, belligerent, bullheaded bigmouth Trump elitism makes Hillary Clinton one of us by comparison.

Jeb Bush, if you wanna speak Spanish, you can go to Mexico, where Spanish is the official language. If you dont have a cohesive policy, it docent matter whether you speak Spanish or Italian, youll lose. Jeb Bush is too low energy, has no charisma. His brother GW has charisma and could get your attention. With Jeb Bush you get the feeling hes biting more than he can chew by vying for the presidency. Too low energy!

I was one of the first American reporters to interview Vicente Fox, the Mexican presidential candidate who won and governed from 2000 to 2006. Foxs family name reflects the origin of his family in Ohio, whence his forbear immigrated to Mexico. He had been a Coca Cola exec and spoke perfect English, as did his main rival, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. Jeb Bushs Spanish is perfect, not damn near perfect. The U.S. would be better off if more people here learned at least one foreign language. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if jeb bush is elected there will be a 911 2.0 that guy and his family make to much money from war. they own the companies that supply the military so the more wars the more money they get. TRUMP 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Unfortunately Jeb Bush is an absolute liberal who loves nonWestern people. All he talks about is being fiscally conservative, which, I frankly could care less about his position on money. Jeb Bush is 100% Liberal. He has no loyalty to the West. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Half the asian population support republicans. Jeb Bush just abandoned his traditional supporters to please the hispanics who will never vote for him. The biggest obstacle to republican candidates in pursuing presidency is their IQ.................. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a loser! Jeb Bush meant the latinos and hispanics when using the word anchor baby. But when he is surrounded by spanish speaking journalists, doesnt even have the gut to admit what he meant. Using asians who have less voting power to please the hispanics who will never vote for him no matter what he says. What a loser! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Believe it or not Asian anchor babies are a major problem here in California.

Jeb bush is comparing a few thousand legal Asian visa holders against millions of illegal Mexicans, makes no sense. And if we look at the % chance that a Mexican will commit a crime vs Asian its even more ridiculous. This is why trump is winning the polls <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
MEDIA DECEIVES PEOPLE BY FAKE POLES AND POPULARITY , IN ORDER TO WITHDRAW ATTENTION FROM REAL JEB BUSH OPPONENTS , SO TRUMP COMES IN LEAD THEN AT THE END THEY WILL DECLARE BUSH AS WINNER ...SAME GAME OVER AND OVER FAKE DEMOCRACY OVER AND OVER...LOL <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I dont really give a shit at all about this. Theyre Western people part of our Civilization. its entirely irrelevant. Why dont we talk about Jebs hispanic wife and his loyalty to the hispanic people and the Hispanic civilization. At least Donald Trump is actually Conservative unlike Jeb Bush and his economy bullshit rhetoric. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has offended Mexicans, veterans John McCain, women Megan Kelly, immigrants in general and other Republicans Jeb Bush, Rand Paul and Rick Perry. The only thing left for Donald Trump to do is offend Black people by showing up in Klansmen robes and using the N word repeatedly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everyone should just show love towards each other life is very short just remember this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Did I just hear, Trump saying that he doesnt want people to come in at all to the country, but Jeb Bush does? 032 So, does this mean Trump doesnt want anyone coming in to the country.. he said it. What a Selfish, Entitled, German Idiot.. Trumps immigrant parents made it in to the country, but seems like Trump now doesnt really want anyone else coming in at all..hmm <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No One???? Who the fu is Jeb Bush talking to? TRUMP 2016 !!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
jeb bush is a pussy bitch <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hes right....jeb doesnt have the energy this country needs. We dont need a third bush in the white house and thats for sure! Trump will get shot done for our country and make it so we can be at peace with other countrys. ...I think other presidents from all other countrys like him and so do I and almost everyone I talk to as well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im an Independent. Over the course of my life, Ive voted for Republicans AND Ive voted for Democrats. I vote for the Person, not the Party. For 2016, I feel that America will benefit MORE by having a Conservative in the White House. When Jeb Bush speaks negatively about Donald Trump having supported persons on the Democratic ticket in the past, Jeb is speaking negatively about ME. Needless to say, but I will not vote for Jeb Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb any day of the week <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush seems way more smarter than his father, and way more sensible than his older brother. Too bad he wont win though. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb is a proven puppet, last thing we need is another Bush! #Trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb is a disgusting, little weak pathetic baby! Vote #Trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One of these fucks will start a world war. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why doesnt Jeb bush just invade Donald Trump? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is a big baby, dummy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is Trump winning? Because the American people dont want a actor or a two face like Wussy Jeb Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FU JEB BUSH! Your just like your brother and father. We dont need another Bush in the white house. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am a conservative, and would never vote for Jeb Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
America will not vote in another Bush....give it up jeb <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its clear jeb bush is a putz, hillary clinton is a sociopath and Donald Trump has my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush has no chance beating Mr Trump. To put it in car terms, its like Jebby trying to beat Mr Trump Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport vs Jeb Nissan Sentra. Its just not happening.. Get it?! Got it?! GOOD!!!! #2016Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I could never vote for any Bush after what Jebs John his real name grandfather Prescott Bush did. Prescott was financing Hitler during the war, the US had to shut Bush down because he defied Americas ruling and continued to support the Germans. Look these people up and educate yourself...otherwise you get what you pay for <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why dont we vote now? And include writein candidates. Might be shocking to see how many votes Jon Stewart, Deez Nutz, and Elizabeth Warren might get. Would laugh to find Bobcat Goldthwait garnering more votes than Ted Cruz, or Pee Wee Herman easily besting Jeb Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you have to have a Republican as your president out of the bunch that are available, wouldnt it have to be Trump? Is Jeb Bush really a better option? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everyone vote for Hillary Clinton ! Donald Trump is going to be a dictator if he was president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fuck Jeb bush #Trump2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its amusing to hear people say I love TRUMP because he speaks his mind and pulls no punches .Comedians speak their minds and people love them too. TRUMP is just ENTERTAINMENT.....He will NEVER BE THE NOMINEE. He is only hurting the REPUBLICAN BRAND and will cause his followers to NOT vote AT ALL once FRUSTRATION and PERSONAL ANGUISH at a JEB Clampett BUSH or SNOT WALKER nomination sets in... OH...and make way for the HISPANIC TSUNAMI OF VOTES!... HA! HA! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If you ever feel stupid just remember some people are actually going to vote for this clown <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The people dont feel a strong vibration off of Jeb Bush but feel low or no energy from him. When people do not feel the energy off of Jeb Bush who is running to be the next Commander in Chief, then the people are not moved. Jeb Bush wont get far. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb bush scares me ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush represent special interest groups. Meanwhile, Trump represents average American citizens who want to get the economy back on track to save the country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
how the hell did Jeb Bush jump so much from yesterday? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Most people already have their minds made up.... Hes likely already got the nomination locked in. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Scott Walker and Jeb Bush need to step their games up. If they lose Iowa to Donald Trump they might have to drop out of the race. New Hampshire Republicans are a lot more friendly to Trump ideas and I dont see either of them pull out a victory in South Carolina @ColoredSpaces <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

For Republicans to actually be competitive let alone win the the presidential election theyre going to need more than 50% of the Latino vote which Romney didnt get anywhere close to so lets see how much Donald gets <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I see some comments here where Donald Trump is seen as a TRUTH TELLER. That is laughable. For example, both Trump and Jeb Bush claim to be 6 3 tall. Did you ever see them side by side, like on a debate stage? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont agree with Hillary often, but shes correct here. Where was the corporate media outrage when Jeb Bush and Colin Powell did the same? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush is a bullshitter, this guy atleast is honest in his douchiness. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Always talking about other people. Never about a legitimate plan to do anything just building giant walls to waste as much taxpayer money as he can and then right back to gossiping like a bitch. He behaves more like a self loathing obese soccer mom on her 3rd divorce than a presidential candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why I like Trump. He is not a politician, and he knows how to make money. Deals with deals on a daily basis. Too early to tell how good of a president he would be, but anything seems at this point better than what we have now and could possibly have in the future from Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush. This country needs to change. It is not the greatest country in the world anymore, but it could be. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How, in Gods name, does this woman have supporters? She lies through her teeth and politicizes EVERYTHING when it is to her advantage to do so. NO MORE CLINTONS! NO MORE BUSHS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RAND PAUL FOR PRESIDENT <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No to Hillary Clinton and no to Jeb Bush,to vote for either or would be senseless.Politicians whether they be Democrats or Republicans are great on talk but once voted it they are unreliable and untrustworthy for they wont follow through on campaign promises.All talk no action in short form,Clintons agenda is best sumarized using one word being,SELFSERVING !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump has grown on me as a candidate. Is something wrong with me? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
jeb really doesnt have a chance, we have had too many bushs, not his fault, nothing personal, but he is late to the game, his father and brother beat him to it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does it matter? Carson has no chance of this presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I fucking hate Rand Pauls retarded ass. thats why he is getting burned by The Donald <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats right black lives matters. Jeb Bush actually purged black peoples vote in the 2000 elections and gave George Bush the presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush will win, its so obvious <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a #Bernie2016 supporter whose no fan of Hillary Clinton, but this is such a manufactured scandal. Jeb Bush Colin Powell used private email accounts, selfselected which emails to release and I dont remember any outrage from corporate media. Criticize her centerright policies, not her emails. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope he continues to stick pins in that balloonhead Jeb Bush. If all he accomplishes is keeping Jeb Bush out of office, it will have been a successful presidential run for Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is going to double fist hillary right in her butthole. You can bet she and CNN do not want Trump the legend to vs her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If elected, Trump is going to send your kids to another catastrophic war in the middle east !. Look at your kids.. do U want them to die !?!, no????... so dont vote for a Republican!. Republican president is a guaranteed war, maybe 3 world war, and a fascist genocidal austerity against the american people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He makes a joke, but she lets people die and hides emails. I wonder which one they care about more! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One of Donald Trumps Uncle Tom cronies. This guy despises black people and she goes on CNN and kisses his ass like some kind of halfass campaign manager. What some people will do for money and a little bit of exposure. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hilary cant even watch her man. Yet her idiot supporters think she can watch our country. How pathetic. As Trump would say, Shes a loser. #Trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Lots of symbolism in this video. The morons blocking the interstate represent megyn kelly trying to block Trump from winning so that her socialist boy jeb bush can get the nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think we can all agree that Jeb Bush is retarded. He cant even go toe to toe with a random kid. She was point on with everything she said and the best he could do is say we can agree to disagree. He has no conviction and his lack of any real response tells you all you need to know about his agenda. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush insults the intelligence of ALL voters. But Donald Trump is R.I.N.O the same as many others. He is supported by CNN constant interviews and CNN typically supports Obama. Alarms should be going off in your heads. Rand Paul is the only chance America has at avoiding a World War, and at avoiding a Civil War. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush.... as if 2 Bushs werent enough... Hilary Clinton... She cant keep up with her Emails , surely she can lead a country.... Bernie Sanders..... no matter what he says, I hear Its still finger licking good Trump 2016 The Bitches get stitches campaign <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush is a loser. The Bush family almost ruined America and on that basis alone Jeb should drop out of the race. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets not get bamboozled into Jebs lies and deceptiveness, as he goes on his mission of his self serving corporatist agenda.

Once again the Republicans attack trump because he is not the chosen one. We all know thats jeb, then been working on him a long time they made him marry a Mexican so he could win the Mexican vote.

Rand Paul is the best LEADER running, and an impartial study will show he really does have the best, most well thought out plan for the USA he might not have Trumps money or TV connections, but he can win with grassroots support the primaries and primary debates will be critical, based on his record and his platform, Senator Paul has got my vote in the primaries. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hes only got 25% of the Republicans the other 75% dont like him. And overall he probably has a 10% approval from both parties combined. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush dont stand a chance in hell against a real business man. Trump shows no sign of backing down because he isnt dependent on special interest group money. I hope Trump bankrupts Republicans and Democrats. I hope special interest group candidates can never participate in an election again. Hilary Clinton is a feminist who hates men and freedom. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush receive millions of dollars from special interest groups who are destroying the United States. Democrats and Republicans wont work with Trump if he wins the presidential election. Republican and Democrats will paralyze the government to ensure Trump accomplishes nothing. Trump might be forced to executive order everything to protect American business and people from incompetent special interest groups political parties such as the Republicans and Democrats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is the worst candidate for President in the history of this country. It amazes me how stupid people really are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
America doesnt want another Bush in the Whitehouse. Jeb may say hes different but his brother is George W. Bush and 911 2001 is still kinda fishy. Lindsey Graham may say hes different but his best friend is John McCain and both sure do think alike in taking out President Assad of Syria. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant believe anyone is supporting Jeb Bush or Scott Walker. Actually, I dont see a viable candidate in any of them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is kind of disgusting to see......YOU DONT SEE THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OF MEXICO CAMPAIGNING IN ENGLISH! JEB IS A DISGRACE! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Absolutely no specifics from Trump. He is not a serious candidate. He has taken every liberal position in the book. No Trump supporter can dispute that. Jeb is not as bad as people say. Trump has same immigration views as Bush. A path to legal citizenship, which is the most reasonable solution. Common core is a bit far reaching, but the general idea is something I can be convinced is good. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Huckabee almost makes Jeb Bush seem reasonable by comparison. Sanders or Trump 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Where did all these liberal pussies come from? oh wait, its a CNN video. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You know, Trumps candidacy is serious news and I wish people would stop trying to trivialize it with jokes about his combover. Ive seen people saying he looks like a softserve ice cream cone, that his hair is the Bush that Jeb seems to have misplaced, that if he doesnt win there will be hell toupee, etc. Actually, thats not even his hair. Its decorative plumage, and during the mating season, he raises it in a majestic crest to impress the females of his species. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If the media would quit, changing Trumps words. Everyone can hear what he is saying and the media says he said something else. Kind of wondering if they are deaf, stupid or just not listening. The harder the media try to tear him down the more people want to listen to Trump. Oh and we dont need or want journalist. we just want the good old reporters back. They gave us news, not there personal opinions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She broke the law. Put her in jail. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is representing the real GOP and Jeb Bush doesnt have a chance with this guy in the game. Everyone else just seems stiff and boring in comparison. He may not be presidential but he does know how to put on a good show and thats OK for 60% of the American people. As long as he can be tough on foreign issues and keep the economy together, he has a good chance of winning. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dear CNN, Trump is not the only one running in this race so stop giving him nonstop coverage. I mean, you also have Hillary Clinton D, Bernie Sanders I, Martin OMalley D, Jim Webb D, Lindsay Graham R, Rand Paul R, Chris Christie R and Jeb Bush R. Try reporting on them as well as this is not a one man election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is a shame the girl prevented Jeb Bush from answering the question. CNN, by publishing this video and making a case of it, is clearly subjective and taking on the democrats side in this story <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HAHAHA I love how all these pieces of shit are fighting one another! Here is a list of assholes John McCain Lindsey Graham Chris Christie Donald Trump Hillary Clinton Jeb Bush Barack Obama Rick Perry ....fuck, there are too many assholes for me to list.

Great job, CNN. I cant stand this clown Trump any longer on the screen. Somebody should shut him down period and that only hackers could do... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny watching these republican clowns argue. Ever since Bush fucked up so bad and Obama trounced them twice in a row theyve become a complete circus. If you let Trump lead the polls and get taken seriously then your party is in ruins. Hes literally a rich Troll off the street leading your partys primary polls LMAO Hes funny as fuck though. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

There is a reason you have never seen donald ladyboy trump EVER at any wounded warriors bedside, or at any VA hospital, or clinic.

Fuk trump, and his veteran hating supporters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a louder voice against Hillary and Obama than probably all the other candidates put together because hes more passionate and you remember what he says. Jeb Bush is just boring and Rick Perry sounds like a monotone robot reading cliques off a teleprompter. I like how Trump is using this attack on him to counter attack on the issue that our Veterans are being shafted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump doesnt need money from big money corporations that have a stranglehold on this country. Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton do which affects what they say and how they do things.

Americans already work long hours and their wages have been stagnant for decades. Americans need higher wages to match inflation costs.

Ignorance is not something you want in an American president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The interviewer is a jackass. He is incredibly arrogant. Hes only employed because His brother is the Governor of New York and hes hott! If it werent for those two reasons, especially the first reason, hed never ever have even been considered. Not even for an internship. Jeb meant exactly what he said and everyone knows it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I like the way Trump Bernie speak, they say what they mean without B.S politician double speak , I lean left and hope Bernie wins it all BUT if its Trump against Hilliary then I would probably support Trump because he would fix illegal immigration and is against TPP and crooked China deals, Trump is a multibillionaire so I dont think he can be bought off. Unlike Hilliary, Jeb or seemingly Obama who is pro TPP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This may sound crazy but if we were to impeach Obama and put a George Bush like guy but one with brains like his brother Jeb, old Putin would be more in step and respecting.

Putin can bitch slap Obama and.he will not do Jack about it. Time to get Jeb in Office. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Nobody actually believes that Trump wants to be president right? Hes obviously there to split the vote. I bet you he made a deal with Bush. Watch trump make the ticket for VP after the primarys. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The real hunger games question is whether two tributes fro the same district will be allowed to both win so long as they pretend to be in love. Can we get a constitutional amendment revoking the requirement that the president and vice president must be from different states, just so that we can watch Jeb Bush and Marco Rubia get gay married on TV? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As soon as someone speaks the truth they get slated !!!!we had the same problem with Nigel Farage he spoke the truth and they slated him this comment has been going around the Media for to long now its ridiculous.

How can a country be so collectively stupid? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush meeting with SC Clergy is admirable, but if he is going in clinging to the stance he took after supreme court 63 decision. He is STILL focused like a lazer on Repealing Obamacare. Wasnt it made clear that the Pastor Senator was a foot solider for Healthcare for all? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a big Donald Trump fan, but unfortunately this is an election so Jeb Bush has to win if we are to beat Hillary Clinton. It takes a dynasty to beat a dynasty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Man. How different would the world be if this guy had gotten to the White House before G W BUSH the second. Jeb Bush seems a hell of a lot more likeable and intelligent then his brother. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is exactly why republicans need to open up about gay marriage. if they dont they will lose 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Faggots bunch of complete degens...such a shame...Save us Jeb Bush!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is actually right though. Making acts illegal make people bad. Just like criminalizing weed. Crossing over the border, or doing weed is a gateway to crime, ONLY because its illegal, if it werent, there wouldnt be as many criminals. But that does not mean that they should open the borders, but instead make a better legal process of immigration and increase security. Vote for Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well... This country is oh so fucked <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush is a Satanist. If he is unwilling to stick to Christian principles in his economic policies then he is creating Sacrilege every time he steps inside the church. He should be ex communicated.

when did CNN care about religion? does CNN just want Republicans and Conservatives to turn their back at Jeb Bush? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cnn tries to discredit Trump by editing everything of substance out and adding goofy music. This is good news it means they see Trump as a threat to Hillary certainly they are not afraid of Jeb the Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
compared to Jeb Bush she is lovable <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When it comes to climate change, he wants religion out of politics. Yet I can guarantee hed try to use religion to fight against gay marriage and force Christianity in secular places where it doesnt fit, like public school. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush doesnt look to GOD for is economic policies that would be crazy!! He looks to the devil! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Finally well have a real business man as president. Itll be a landslide if he runs under the Republican ticket. Just kick Jeb Bush out of the race, no one i know wants 4 more years of the Bush dynasty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush will have a hard time raising money for his Presidential race because America has said we do not want another Bush in the White House. America is exhausted by Jebs brother George W. Bush who was President for 8 yrs. My advice for Jeb Bush is this if you do not want to run for President you dont have too and dont let anybody force you to run. Jeb Run for Mayor or Governor dont run for the national race, save Bush name by not running for President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CNN needs to get off Hilarys dick <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton all the same but only different by their party name RepublicanDemocrat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary will definitely get the nomination. And I dont think Republicans have the numbers to win the general election, regardless of who they throw at her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate saying it but I got A feeling for some reason the 2016 election will be either hillery vs jeb bush or rick santorum as sick as it make me something tale me they all ready got this one under raps there no way these crook are letting bernie sander or raund paul near the white house polls all ready declare hillery ahead of bernie sander with seventy five percent of democrats supporting her if any one beleive that you belong in muriica. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lindsey Graham doesnt have a chance of winning the Republican nominee unless hes in the race only to suck up alot of votes from other candidates so that Jeb Bush can win and nobody wants another Bush as President in the White House. Why doesnt people like Lindsey Graham? Because Lindseys best friend is John McCain. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even if Rand Paul has the votes to win presidency, Jeb Bush or Hillary will end up with power because thats how this country is, its not up to the citizens, its up to the politicians. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Scott Walker would be a little better than Jeb Bush, but my vote is going to Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz has as good a chance at beating the lesbian Hillary as anyone we could nominate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If this guy can pull this off, he is the president that we Americans been waiting for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i lost my step brother in iraq in 2004 why do we need more bushs ? all we went throw in the 00s if your a voter dont vote for jeb bush dont give him a chance please <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, not this guy again. Hes probably just running to help Jeb Bush win the primary like he did for Romeny. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The people who are intending to vote for Hillary Clinton dont realize that theyre voting for the complete downfall of America. If Hillary Clinton takes office, it will be over. Not to mention Jeb Bush too. We all experienced George W Bush in office for 8 cruel years, and I dont think we want another Bush in office all over again. Jeb Bush has even admitted that he would take advice from his brother when it came to making political and economical decisions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Luciferian New World Order sure wants Jeb Bush for President to finish.what Barack Obama started. The truth is nobody wants another Bush in the white house or a Hillary Clinton just accept the fact and move on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fags are the haters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder will Rick Santorum be used to take away as many votes from honest candidates running for President so that Jeb Bush could win the Republican nominee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the coalition of the willing and Iran should work together jeb bush is right in this case but we should do it but with more countries like i said before iran turkey saudi arabia and yes iraqi army cant take on isis its incompetent . finish what you started before <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If the American people had ever known the truth about what we Bushes have done to this nation, we would be chased down in the streets and lynched. George H. W. Bush Jebs daddy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush has got most of the advisers who ruined his brother and his country.He seems as idiotic as his brother, and America will take another dive if he is elected.Even now he does not know if invasion of Iraq was right or wrong. The problem seems to be an end to GOP politics. Whistle on Hillary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
America is such a maledominated country. Jeb Bush and Scott Walker did the same thing Hillary did with the emails and nooooo problem theyre men. Hillary does it and ll the sudden is a big deal. This male domination needs to stop so Im voting for Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Oh, Jeb Bush. Facepalm. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck you CNN, this is the kind of exchange candidates should dread. Really!? So when a Lobbied piece of shit like Jeb Bush is questioned about truthful issues that hes going to eradicate and make worse, reporters should feel sorry for him? Like WHAT THE FUCK!!! I cant believe this is even happening. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is NOT Obamas fault to pull back from Iraq. It was what the people wanted. The majority of Americans are actually in favor of leaving IraqAfghan during the 2008 elections hence why he got voted in the first place. If Jeb Bush was ballsy enough to point fingers he should point at all the people that voted for Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If America sends troops to stop ISIS just to kill more Sunnis of Iraq, and support the Sectarian Iraqi Government? I swear to God I will kill every American adult male I see in my path here in the Gulf! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul 2016! This guy is what the USA needs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This girl is acting like a spoiled kid. I dont like Jeb Bush, but she was totally disrespectful and really had nothing substantial to say. She was just attacking. Young people which Im part of really need some growing up. If she felt strongly about this, then get a direct and on point question made, shes looking for microphone time and her few minutes of fame. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Why are republicans so desprate to hear from a woman that they have no plans on voting for ??? Have u jackass republicans picked YOUR CANDIDATE yet ??? Is your front runner Jeb Bush still trying to decide whether or not he thinks IRAQ was a mistake ??? Assuming Hillarys the nominee the election is still 17 months away TAKE A FUCKING CHILL PILL..she doesnt need to be talking to the media right now <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush needs to overcome Iraq war which he cannot, because he starts with the same people who buried his brother he has to overcome Obamas foreign policy mindset, again which he cannot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush needs to deport at least 75% of the 11 million illegals, then I will trust he is on the ethnic American peoples side and not proforeign, proimmigration, promoney. Stand up for the majority of the people Bush. Scott Walker will if you dont. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im voting for Jeb Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Evil Jeb is history. The American people will not forget about your evil brother evil deeds and Evil Bushs lying war. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All the Bushs love war...their loved ones will NEVER die in War! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You can bet that if Jeb Bush is President then the whole world will become unstable with war yet again. Lets not have history repeat itself with the terrorist that is George Bush. Thats official. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Jeb Bush is not the biggest idiot on the republican side I dont know who is. Why would a person vote for you when you cant even fake as if you dont agree with your shitty brother and his shitty policies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even if Bush did create ISIS, what does that have to do with Jeb Bush? I dont support Jeb Bush, but do you really think that if Jeb Bush was elected, it would be the same as his Brother running the country? Thats absurd. He is mush smarter than his Brother. Also, did anyone listen to Jebs response to that girl? CNN cut it off. What a surprise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I know why Jeb and the rest of the Bush Klan are where they are. The SCUM rises to the top. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

JEB BUSH IS A TYPICAL LIGHTWEIGHT CONSERVATIVE FLIPFLOPPER. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These war mongering bastards from the Bush family would have still invaded Iraq no matter what. The weapons inspectors found nothing and George W. Bush invaded Iraq anyway because he was so desperate for his thirst for war. The whole Bush family are nothing but corrupt war mongering criminals. No Jeb for 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No you stupid bimbo Obama created Isis but thanks for being a useful idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If this country elects another third Bush into the oval office, there should be a revolt! We already know they all operate the same W. did what Harbert did, I dont believe Jeb is any different. They are literally FAMILY. We didnt want the Daddy in office for a reason, W got into a war to keep his job and make Chaney rich Halliburton why would ANYONE think this is a good idea ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey, Im not a Jeb Bush supporter, but damn show some respect you little shit... The man has no personal conflict with America, its only the name thats been partially soiled by the public. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

TYPICAL EVASIVE CONSERVATIVE COWARD JEB CLEETUS BUSH DIDNT HAVE GUTS TO ANSWER A SIMPLE QUESTION. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
At least Hillary Clinton is prepare to see her husbands presidency for what it was. Seems like Jeb Bush is not willing to put down the rose colored glasses of his brothers presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Pundit at 110 that clearly was a liberal or a democrat that was trying to get a rise out of Jeb Bush... ?? That is utter BS. A young woman was asking a legitimate question about one of the worst policy decisions ever made by any country, and the pundit infers her political affiliations. Shame on you. CNN is financially invested in promoting the destructive 2party system that makes those policy disasters possible. Boycott CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

America should be ashamed at the prospect of another Bush in the running, you guys never learn. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama giving weapons to rebels,created Isis. Obama leaving Iraq with a puppet government created Isis. Obama supporting rebels in Syria to overthrow Assad created Isis.Obama saying Isis is a J.V.

Jeb Bush was then immediately rushed to the hospital and treated for 2nd and 3rd degree burns. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

There is no reason for Jeb Bush to run if he can not even answer the Iraq question. Everything he is asked the same question he has given a different answer. He can not make up his mind. He even gives two answers in the same sentence about running for president. He is a joke @ColoredSpaces <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We dont need another Bush because we will end up in mess by invading Iran. So Fuck You Jeb Bush! We need another Reagen or Kenndy that need to stand up against that ball headed bastard Putin aka The Russian Lex Luthor. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think he is saying that in the situation with the false information given, he and most wouldve invaded. I think thats a pretty true statement. Im not saying i liked the outcome of the war, nobody does, not even jeb. Nor do i support the bushs for that matter. Just sayin, i dont think his intent was to say the war was good, it was to shed light on the difficult situation his brother faced, which i dont deny. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush needs to shut his retarded mouth, and stop defending his more retarded brother. And let Hillary Clinton speak for herself. Jackass. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clinton did NOT have all of the intelligence. Furthermore, Bush manipulated intelligence. Bush knew he was taking the country to war illegally. Clinton, on the other hand, was given the war criminal crafted version of the intell. to influence the country, the threat Saddam posed was imminent. In addition, Clinton wasnt crafting a case for war by lies and war crimes. This statement alone should bar Jeb Bush from the presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush has a helping his brother cheat in the 2000 elections problems. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If I want to get to know Jeb Bush, Im NOT going to trust CNN, a corporate owned and operated propaganda network. Ill look around on the internet and look to different sources for that information. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who is Jeb Bush? He is a man who comes from a family of war criminals. The Bush family spent trillions of dollars on wars. These wars have provided no benefits to the American people. Nobody can trust this rat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

All you need to know about Jeb is that hes Dubyas brother. Merica cant possibly be stupid enough to elect another Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wasnt it Rand Paul who said that Congress has the power to declare war not the President when Obama was about to give an order to launch a missle strike into Syria in AugustSeptember 2013 while Russian warships were in the Mediterranean sea. Did Hillary Clinton say Congress has the power to declare war and not the President? Did Jeb Bush spoke up to say something? Hillary Clinton backed now ousted Egyptian President Mohammad Morsi who was a former Muslim Brotherhood Leader. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It is too dangerous for all of us, including Americans themselves, when retards rule the most powerful country in the world. The presidency of George W.

How is it going to complicate relations with Obama administration when Obama is leaving White House in a year? 2016 president will be a republican. Netanyahu and Jeb Bush 2016 2024. Sounds like a perfect effective relation to me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wish the Governor of Ohio was running. What Jeb Bush considers a Backbone, I consider pandering to your political base. I real leader can lead their party, NOT follow them. Something Kasich is proven not to be doing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It matters as much as Jeb Bush releasing his emails. Its only a scandal to the clowns at Fox news and their followers. Shes more trustworthy than Jeb. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jebs strategy is to be a bush and make Hilary look good so she wins the election. Hilary was told in 2008 she was next to be president by the illuminist <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im not necessarily a fan of Hillary Clinton, but this is such a manufactured scandal. Jeb Bush Colin Powell used private email accounts, then selfselected which ones to release and I dont remember any DC news media fake outrage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hope you guys regret all your stupid commets on Obama, once Jeb Bush takes presidency <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I find it hysterical that Clinton and Bush are good friends while Clinton and Gore his VP for 8 years cant stand the sight of each other. I guess its because Bush and Clinton really are very similar in that they are both great politicians who know how to win...while Gore is and always will be a big fat pompous stuck up loser. Gore had a stick up his ass, thats why he lost the election. Bush and Clinton were very relatable by contrast. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Yep, Fox News and the Evil Bushes are painting pretty pictures of Evil Jeb. So is the News media. Theres a lot things about the Evil Bushs family. They love money, power, and they want you to worshipped them like gods. Like Fox News does. The whole family dont care if they have innocent blood on their hands in Iraq by Evil Bushs lying war. Evil Bush profit in high gas prices. Evil Bushs daddy talk about the New World Order on you tube. The illuminati cult family in the disguise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I thought the public was sick of the Clintons back in 2008 when we elected Obama. Same for Jeb Bush. America needs some new blood instead of old recycled political hack dynasties. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im My Own Grandpa? With Wolfowitz, Hadley and other prominent Iraq War neocons on his roster, he is hardly his own man. Jeb Bush after all was one of the original endorsers of Bill Kristols PNAC plan for war to reshape the entire Middle East all from a DC eggheads armchair. A Jeb Bush foreign policy would probably be worse than a Rodham team foreign policy although that is not saying a lot unfortunately. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If the American people had ever known the truth about what we Bushes have done to this nation, we would be chased down in the streets and lynched. George H. W.

Jeb Bush is a patriotic American. Hilary is an old hag <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Little to no chance of Jeb winning. Some conservatives think hes a RINO. Probably wont win the Republican primaries. In case he does win, Americans arent going for another Bush. Mitt Romney has a better chance of winning. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dear Jeb Bush first of all ROFL. Jeb Bush Its true there was no mass weapon destruction in Iraq but my brother was doing the right thing and the most heroic thing any president had to go through.

Prescott Bush was a Nazi and tried to overthrow the US government in the Business Plot. George Senior puked on an Asian and invaded Iraq. George Junior is guilty of war crimes and created two wars.

The Republicans dont have any viable candidates for 2016, so its funny to see CNN taking this freak show seriously.

Romney had to step aside because hed be taking too many supporters away from Jeb Bush and Chris Christie. Regardless, Bush and Christie probably wont make it past the primaries, and even if they do, America isnt going to elect someone with the last name Bush or a fat Jersey bully anyway. The GOP has no viable mainstream candidates this time around, and thats good news for Democrats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Romneys key donors and longtime staffers were jumping ship to Jeb Bush. Even Donald Trump, who endorsed him in 2012, slammed him against a run. He was beat. As far as Jeb is concerned, he last name is still Bush. Its gonna be a tough sell to Americans. Weve had enough Bushes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im 18 and I just voted Republican. The economy, taxes, and immigration are important, but the main reasons I went conservative were abortion and gay marriage. Im avidly against both. Please, Republicans dont let me down! Do what you can while you have the majority! I know youre checking out these comments or at least youd better be if you value the younger voters. Like if youre prolife so this is seen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The United States Congress listened to the American people stopping President Barack Obama from launching missle strikes into Syria against President Assad in 2013 in the late months of August to September with Russian warahips aiming their missles towards American warships in the Mediterranean. Where was Jeb Bush then? Jeb Bush was quiet, he didnt make a stand, he sat on his ass. The Bush last name has been tained with shame, dishonor and betrayal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone considering voting for Hillary why does it even matter Clinton or Jeb Bush should really ponder suicide because youre a fucking idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
More Libertarians! Less Establishment! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OMG,,not another Bush,,i dont even wont another Clinton,,,it time for new leader to make real substance and profitable change,because the only change President Obama did was cosigning that Rainbows are real . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All Im going to say is this, if Jeb Bush does run for President in 2016 and wins, it proves one or two things. One, that the American public really is fucking retarded. Or two, Presidential elections are rigged. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

On election night in 2000 all networks but fox called Florida for Al Gore. Jeb and W broke down in tears. It was basically over for George W Bush after that. The Bush campaign panicked in anger and rage and ordered Fox to call it for Bush. It was pulled back from a Gore victory 3 hours later and fox called Bush the next president. The Gore campaign asked for a statewide hand count but Jeb and Katherine Harris threw out thousands of absentee votes for Gore. Karma got them in the end. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Where was Jeb Bush in August through September 2013 when President Barack Obama was about to use his executive powers to launch missle strikes in Syria without the approval of Congress. Where was Jeb Bush when Obama invited to the white house then but now ousted Mohammad Morsi former Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.the media wants to through these candidates in our faces and the American people are not stupid. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah because having Jeb Bush as president creating more wars is a good idea... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would vote for Satan before I vote for either Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton. Hillary may be Satan . So maybe Charles Manson over Hillary and Jeb. Definitely Charlie. You have got to be kidding me.

jeb bush will be a great president he is the number 1 person I want to be president. he is definetly gonna fix the problems of our country <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets not forget Jebs brother double the national debt with deficits which was 6.1 trillion. George W. Bush holds the most debt by any president in history more so than Barack Obama to this day. Jeb Bush is no conservative and Ted Cruz is cool, but Rand Paul would be the most conservative candidate for the 2016 presidential primaries. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The politicians who stopped Barack Obama from giving the green light to launch a tomahawk missle into Syria in AugustSeptember 2013 should be the ones running for President. Not Clinton not Jeb Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny because he thinks he can actually run for president and be such a train wreck. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
castro will help the illegals get housing but,americans will not and cannot because obummer wants their illegal vote and before he goes out of office he will give all those illegals amnesty so they will help vote in another communist like he is america needs to wake up and get obummer out before its too late <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Republican Alan Grayson needs to be on that list of candidates running for President. Alan Grayson who in September 2013 said that Barack Obama cannot declare war on Syria without the approval of Congress, Congress who represents the people. Obama who was about to start World War 3 with a missle strike on Syria. Where was Jeb Bush? Where was Hillary? I want to see Alan Grayson run for President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is CNN promoting Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton for president? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush thinks ilegals coming to this country is an act of love. While fathers and mothers are in prison for selling drugs to feed their kids. I guess theyre not brown enough to be above the law. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Part of me doesnt want Jeb to run since he is not that good and he is a Bush, part of me wants Jeb to run since it will only increase the popularity of 3rd parties and stimulate GOP reform. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its a regime people...Jeb Bush has already been elected. Dont think that your vote counts.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please America, dont do it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Jeb would make a good president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush has a snowballs chance in a blazing Hell of being elected President. Now whether the idiots that make up the Republican Party will nominate him is another matter. Im an Independent, by the way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
First off Jeb Bush has probably already been selected to be President by the evil elite as they have done with all other presidents and the elections are a facade or you could call it theatre to fool the public they are actually voting in a president. Its always been like this since day one. The American elections are the biggest con in politics and dumb Americans think their vote counts. What a joke and they call themselves a democracy when their elections are always rigged. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CNN you fucking clowns have done it again. Is that any way to welcome a future kings and queen. Excuse me? Fuck royalty! Considering how detrimental to mankind both monarchies and the British empire have been, I think a more fitting welcome would have been publicly executing both of them on the spot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its CNN, I dont know why this comment section has so many people upset. Its not like CNN is known for good journalism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The media has already begun their own selection process, which consists entirely of Moderates RINOs. NO, to Jeb Bush !! NO, to Christie. NO, to Huckabee. NO, to Romney. These moderates are a windfall for the democrats. They wont vote them, anyway. Ideological concessions wont help. So, why try ?!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hell naw! Fool me once 1st Bush Shame on you, Fool me twice George W Bush shame on me. Fool me a third time Jeb Game Over. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Another Bush? Really? Further our debt like his stupid brother. Allow his families business needs interfere with the needs of the nation. Ensure the poor get even more poor while his friends get richer. Sure vote for him if you want to go back to Iraq. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama isnt worth a shit as president. He is taking us back to the days of the cold war. Impeach this useless excuse for a president! America needs REAL leadership! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Of course B. Clinton, the Wolf of Pennsylvania Ave is going to hate T. Cruz. Cruz stands for something. Clinton was an impeached President manwhore who stood for nothing and got nothing accomplished. His wife is a rollover fool who cares less for herself than acquisition of power. No, hes not the worst President ever, hes in office right now. You lucked out J. Carter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey George P, I have a question Id like you to answer. All those votes you got in the primary, WHERE ARE THOSE VOTERS? We cant seem to locate them. Or is this yet another bush style vote i.e. cheating????????????????? The UN needs to send in Investigators. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The only reason Donald Trump is trying to attack Jeb Bush is because he has nothing else to say. Trump has no ideas. Trump has no goals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush married a Mexican midget! Imagine his wife at state dinners! She could wander around a state dinner with a cloth in one hand and a can of Brasso in the other to polish the belt buckles of foreign dignitaries. Hey, everyone appreciates a good knob job. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush needs to join armed forces and go to Middle East cause he has no clue. True Warmonger family trait. Sounds like hes taking lessons from Cheney, his uncle. Hell of a legacy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is a puppet they are all puppets . Im sorry but with all the choices that we have Donald Trump seems like the best choice. Bernie Sanders? he seems like a good choice but do you really think anybodys going to listen to him follow his lead you think theyre going to respect him I dont think so TRUMPs are only choice dont screw this up America. The dudes already filthy rich so he cant be bought. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is a puppet, and Donald Trump is his puppeteer ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We know the other career politicians are going to do the same old thing nothing. Trump is the only logical choice, because he may do great things! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush is cool, but I get it now. If you cant run for a third term, then have your brother do it, simple. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

There has been an attack on patriots for along time!...its time to end! Vote Rand Paul end this madness! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ron Paul have fooled our populists that the FED is printing paper money for bankers rather than at the request of the government or fulfilling government directions and common good programs. Such implication also exists in neoNazi populism. No wonder, many of RP supporters are rooting for the mullahs. Even though, Rand has distanced himself from his father, not everyone is convinced. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Is he wrong? The biggest attack on America since Pearl Harbor and no one is questioning Jeb Bushs ridiculous statement that his brother kept us safe. Trump is 100% correct. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Here comes the set up!!! Now Trump will bash Bush but not for the real reasons and then the media and others will feel sorry for Bush, because that part wasnt his fault, and Jeb Bush will fight for his fathers honor, and everyone dumb enough to fall for it, will vote for Jeb Bush, to back him up, and if those votes arent enough then theyll just fix the whole thing, and cover it up with the media, but now theyve got an excuse or a reason. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Trump on that point <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Jebs brother, George II, kept us safe then why would his incompetent staff Dick Cheney have the Air Force stand down when NORAD saw the planes? Also intelligence warned of a threat from Osama. Its definitely Bushs fault. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush did 911 anyway <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Thumbs down for trying to smear someone unrighteously! Your video stinks! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump continues to play the circus clown as he does so well, taking focus off of Jeb Bush so we wont notice his horrible statements and policies. After this monkey runs his mouth for six more months Jeb will seem like a brilliant statesman. You gotta hand it to the GOP, they know how to manufacture consent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush needs to go away, he is weak and spineless....go away Jeb you suck ass! Go Trump...expose the BS in DC!!!! Screw what news people say, they are paid as we all know!!!

Democrats have just found its tagline for Jeb Bush he wants to abolish the 40hour work week, weekend off, and overtime and vacation pay. Buh bye Jeb Bush. Even if his proposal has merits, and I think it has very little, that is not something Americans want to hear, and its not something a presidential candidate should tell voters. And the next person most likely to win the GOP primaries is... Donald Trump. This could really work in Democrats advantage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Trump bald ass raccoon eyed scumbag! He is a fucking crookster and not to mention RACIST BABY DICK PRICK!! As for Jeb Bush FUCK THAT IGNORANT MORON, just like his dipshit daddy and daddies bitch his brother! ID RATHER NOT VOTE THAN VOTE FOR WHAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM!!!

Craig Hewlett predicted a Jeb Bush presidency about 15 years ago. If the Republican Party gives Jeb the ticket I will never vote again because its a set up and rigged. I would much rather let the country burn and let the revolutionrestoration begin. We can take it back in the moment of chaos. Fuck jeb bush.

Jeb Bush said he wouldnt have voted for the invasion if he knew then what he knows now. But he also wouldnt have pulled out almost all the troops so soon like Obama did. Jeb Bush is a smart articulate man who would make a great President. The media is just always trying to trip him up. Why doesnt Hilary get the same treatment? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think if Mr. Jeb Bush is elected to be President, He should invade Iraq on Day 1 of his term. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wait a second.. Jeb Bush had nothing directly to do with the Iraq war but Hillary Clinton voted for it... Why is it going to cast a shadow on his campaign? not saying I support him because I dont <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The reason I would vote for Bernie Sanders is because of the honesty. No other politician would EVER say that America should look more like Scandinavia.

Lets make sure Hillary Clinton wins the Election. Go to all Jeb Bush videos in YouTube and other websites and say that you support Jeb Bush. If the GOP selects him for President, Shell beat him for sure. I think 33% of republicans are tired of having Bushs for President, and they wont go to the polls in the election if another Bush wins the GOP Primary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I dont know how people trust the Clintons still... Blows my mind. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillarys slogan What difference does it make? This video is offensive if anything, to almost everyone. It stereotypes. And it does nothing. I expect nothing more from the Official senate panty dropper. Perhaps you should earn your occupation from having actual skills and not just having a boyfriend in that occupation??? Oh, and nice one becoming senator of a place youve never even lived in before. Terrible and you make the U.S. into a joke by simply existing, Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
her campaign video represents a version of america that is like a rothchilds wet dream... a pleasantvalleypleasantville... A sexless, brainless, opinionless,raceless, idealess, artless, soulless land of pure apathetic grinning moronic yes men and the only calling is to supporting foreign businessmen and most especially, making money for other people who have had money for a long time. Horrid...hope jeb bush doesnt run.. on the basis of this, he has a 5149 chance <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Remember this prediction It will be Hillary vs Jeb Bush. Tough call but Im guessing Jeb will win. If she runs her whole campaign in this manner, catering to the most popular liberal social concerns, I think shell lose because she already has those votes. I think Jeb will win, unless we see a new allstar candidate a la Barack. Thats my prediction. Ill probably vote for her though. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As far as i understand, he is there to cut the votes which are against Jeb Bush....so in a way would help him. His policy statement would be inline with all those running against Jeb Bush. Republicans, make sure to kick this dumb Bush out of the presidential race <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She only has two accomplishments in her political career. 1. She married Bill Clinton. 3. She didnt divorce Bill Clinton. I guess that means its her turn to be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush has already bought paid for the Republican Nomination <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BLOODY MARY WILL BRING CHINA INTO AMERICA....VOTE JEB BUSH <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lmao the fact that this would bring the total of Republican candidates to 3. And Hilary is the ONLY Democratic candidate. Shows that its more likely Hilary will win this. GOP and Tea Party idiots will be st war among each other. While Hilary slides on by with an easy win lol. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am joining Hillary our country needs to move FOWARD AND NOT BACK. Hillary ALL THE WAY IN 2016 AND 2020 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dear God help us all. Im an atheist but Hillary makes me believe Satan exists. She is riddled with scandal, ruthless and bursts out laughing when discussing the death of a person. She will bow to AIPAC and continue the escalation with Russia .She is dangerous for warming relations with Cuba and the historic deal with Iran. Her body language and facial expressions show she is not sincere. She is a terrible liar. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This doesnt sound like the same recycled bullshit that ever politician has been talking about since the the start of this century. So Ill have to decide if I want to vote for her, simply because shell be less bad then Jeb Bush, or vote for someone that is real but wont win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is the best, plus hes Cuban heritage so I can relate to Ted Cruz. Hope Cruz gets nominated. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
