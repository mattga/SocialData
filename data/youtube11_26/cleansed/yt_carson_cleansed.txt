around 300 on up where carson talks about change and the constitution. liberals will bring this up again when its time to discuss the 2nd amendment. saying its outdated, muskets, yada yada <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz will get those voters leaving Carson and go into second UNBEATABLE!!!!! TRUMPCRUZ 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson has all the right skills, experience and most of the right attitude to be President. Jonah Goldberg missed the boat here, as National Review sometimes does, Dr. Carson is a proven veteran at problem solving. Hes got the right take on the Syrian refugee problem, IMHO. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson, on the job. Good assessment of what our goals should be on this issue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson 2016. The country would be better. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS TRUMPCARSON 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How do the CRAZIES afford computers to write these ridiculous statements? I mean, the education level of these Republican primary voters has to be no more than 9th grade. Every day it is something new. Today the Koch brothers must have given Carson a few more million so he would advocate stealing millions not billions, like he said of acres of land owned by the people. Next thing you know the wackos will say burning hydrocarbons is good for your health! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson, you represent the truth. CAIR understood exactly what you meant but he is trying to make bad for you so that people will think that it is racist. You are doing a great job. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson, everyone will try hard to get you out because you are good <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kiss the baby time.. Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson scares me. I agree with almost everything he says but I know how this will go if he becomes president. Either he will be assassinated, the other politicians will eat him alive OR.........he will become a dictator. Im more interested in who his vice president will be IF he makes it that far. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fucking Bill OReilly, man. Acknowledges that Carson is an MD but doesnt extend the same courtesy to Richard Dawkins as a PhD. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Typical OReilly calling Carson a boy.God dam Raciest <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im so glad that my parents have always been very well informed with politics and current events and always worked hard for what they have and have always went right wing, it was like a jump start for me. I grew up the right way and thats how my kids will and their kids as well. Lets go Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
brilliant speech Dr carson. now tell that to the hood blacks! none will agree. they love welfare and hate working. Im a half Chinese half black man who is paralyzed because my black side doesnt wanna work! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson will Kick in the Door like his brother NOTORIOUS BIG in the album life after death look it up, great song lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
dr michael eric dyson said that prez obama is jackie robinson and willie mays is who were waiting for. dr ben carson a.k.a. willie mays is here! #drbencarson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree that the prolife side has been very respectful and reasonable. But Carson didnt say or intend to say that credible people are saying the extreme things. He said there are extreme things being said on both sideswhich is true. And that extreme rhetoric is coming from extreme individuals that arent helping. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has the distinction of being the dumbest brain surgeon in history. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
his answers are correct. its Fox News with their pressures to answer certain questions. which is missing this whole interview up. in my opinion Ben Carson is answering all questions correctly. to those who disagree I question your frame of logic.. his answers are correct <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I want Ben Carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I honestly dont see why people are so against Carson in this video, saying hes an idiot and whatnot when a lot of the stuff hes saying makes sense. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its very sad that this intelligent individual, Dr. Carson words are being twisted by some. Hes right, seems not many are willing to sit down and have an intelligent debate on any subject. And itt ok to disagree without anger, hate, etc.. But that dont effect ratings. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMPCARSON 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMPCARSON 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
all the other candidates are just pissed cause they know trump will win and they never had a chance...most of the republican candidates are a stain on his shirt and democrat candidates are the scum on the bottom of his shoes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The day he serves our country is the day he can open his big fat mouth Until then Fuck Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CARSON CARSON CARSON CARSONNNNNNN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nothing for or against Dr Carson, but do people understand English anymore at all? His statement was very neutral in any way, shape, or form. He simply said clam down with the hate verbiage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and Carson can look forward to having next summer off. Maybe even a relaxing Spring Break... With no election to worry about <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Astonished how that sack of maggot slime disrespects dr carson. You dumb ignorant bitch!!..where the fuck is the money coming from, to house the refugees in our country? We are using 3 billion right now and will waste way more money over the long term by not sending the refugees back to were they came from. Fucking scumbag bitch is a waste and should be deported back to the middle east where her ancestors migrated from. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP 2016 But Ben Carson was nice and never mean <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love the setting An American Flag and a World Map. Case Closed Dr. Ben Carson is a Patriotic Expert in Global Politics. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They do, a major part of the Syrian civil war was the prolonged drought. Obama and sanders are right <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
With further information, it appears that Ms. Davis was NOT in violation of the laws of the State of Kentucky. A little matter of separation of powers under the Constitution. They are trying to create confusion and say Lets pass more laws and Mr. Carson has slipped up on that part. FOX news had a nice little pile of it set for people to step in. And he did. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb bush I kinda dislike refugees Donald Trump I fucking hate refugees, nuke them all Ben Carson I am a wizard and spykids 2 is the best movie Bill Oreilly I hate everything. Carrots are purple, not orange, fuck you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

these faux conservatives are the real reason america is falling into neomarxism. the left has always been crazy but they never did so much damage when conservatives stood firm on their principles, now they just talk and talk and talk and then eventually cave in and do as the democrats tell them. they are using conservative voters and carson is no different, hes clearly lying and playing on the whole religion thing to bag a few more voters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bill OReilly should be ashamed for interupting Dr Carson. It makes him look very bad. Also I dont think Carson knows what he is doing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is the little engine that could i dont want the next president to be a little engine <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON will be nominated exactly because of his brilliant soft spoken personality..... He is not pushy .....he convinces people for real <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope Dr Carson gets the Republican nomination!!! He can beat down Killary Clinton..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, on Dr. Carsons Three Angels Messages comments are blocked. This is supposed to help the voters in staying blindfolded?. The U.S.A. already had playactors for president and governors. Dr. Carson may be a funny change, he profiles as comedian. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a fascist. We need Carson, Cruz or Christie. If Rubio wins then u know its fixed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons a peckerhead...Turkeys selling ISIS oil. Bomb the transporters. Bomb the oil facilities and youll start WW3.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We dont need Carson because he is a self proclaimed liar. Bernie probably wont live another 4 years. We definitely dont need another Obama disguised as an old white woman Bill Clintons wife....... Soooo, I guess Trump is all thats left! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

TRUMPCARSON 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only reason Carson was in the race to begin with was to sell his book. Upon having read the book which is full of very obvious contradictions and lies, many evangelists hopped on the bandwagon to support him. Now he thinks he can actually win. Very stupid. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why Carson talks with his eyes closed? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson for President 2016. Already on the job. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think they are missing a candidate or two. like the candidate with the budget plan that Carson is trying to now bite off of.. I like how hes decided to ditch his original prop lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Imagine Trump trying to answer these questions. I mean can you imagine him saying something coherent like this without insulting some other opponent, calling China or saying I want to make America great again? LOL How wan he be president. Trump is the only one to insult Iowans because he isnt in the lead in the polls there. Smh! CARSON 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What is dopey is that Carson thinks that the earth is 6000 years old. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont agree with Mr Carson on lots of things, but this is one thing that i dont think anyone with a sane sound mind can disagree with. Kudos to him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont understand why anyone would support Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a pathological liar, religious maniac with seemingly no knowledge of foreign policy or any other political matter. Bring these points up and youre part of the oh so spooky liberal media. Clownish person. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
dis is wat it comes down to ben carson is qeer and trump is not qeer <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

does it really matter if he was black or white? the police man shot him 16 times. doesnt matter what race he wasnt how old he was. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Narcissist, he is absolutely awful, I have no respect for Trump and his mouth. Part of the issue is that Ben Carson is an honest man and is willing to look at all views and make decisions based on information, not just pop off whatever sounds good Mr. Sounds Good for Now Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The more I see the Republican presidential race the sadder I feel for America that even after the disaster that was George W Bush Republicans just never seem to learn their lesson and theyre supporting people like Trump and Carson who are basically children with juvenile policies like building a border wall or having a flat tax. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON CARSON CARSON CARSON CARSOOOOONNNNN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TELL IT LIKE IT IS DONALD. Carson is way too slow in the head. Have you listened to him talking? Im not voting for a psychopath. Trump 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is one of the most thoughtful and understanding men I have seen in politics. Hes make a great President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wheres Ben Carson? You tell me that Obama can spew out lie and lie and it means nothing? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please Carson, keep your mouth closed regarding world conflicts. You will just start ww3 and you will not just be an american problem. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is an idiot. Ben Carson offered a theory, he never said it was the truth. Having an opinion or theory is part of freedom of speech and he has every right to speak his thoughts. People are blowing this way out of proportion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only way Carson can become next president just by joining Bohemian Club and masturbate in a coffin P <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is so stupid. 53% of the refugees are women, you goofball. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BEN CARSON 2016 2016 LIES A DAY <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think its way overdue that this cornbread Chicagoan Turkey gangster gets the fuck out of the oval office. Promote tearing down the US constitution? That should be classified as TREASON punishable by DEATH. I hope we get a president that lays down the law, that even suggesting changing the Constitution may be punishable by incarceration. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trust the GOP to put up a person like Carson .. Ideal Nod Master who has probably already rejigged his brain to blissful existence. I do not live in America and I look at your election drama just like I do soap opera. Its a total joke and not hard to see that the real string pullers do not want to waste their precious time in front of stupid cameras. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For her to ask What do they these protesters want? as if to insist they had no reason to be there speaking out is disgusting. If you had a son and a police shot him unjustly and it took a whole year for them to do anything about it... Im sure youd want people to speak out. You wonder why minorities think many on fox are racist...Im not sure why you think that when your bias is so very clear. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trump is the truth! we need to stop being soo correct all the time and start being realistic!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a boring moron with no balls at all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz, Trump, Carson, Rubio, anything but the lying criminal cunt Hillary or Santa Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has no business in this race. You suckers bought his book though, and thats why he ran in the first place. Hes adding to his massive 30 million dollar net worth. Hey, his wife has a book out one month from now about living with Ben Carson, wow what a coincidence. Suckers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is full of shit! Hes a racist scum. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is nothing but BOOORING <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You already force your heterosexual way of life on every e embody else, Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016. Fuck that. whos better Hillary? Bernie? Foh.. Carson isnt stand up enough, cruz is ok but Trump is hard core. Thats what we need right now. This soft shit doesnt work. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not for Ben Carson but the interviewer is a dick hole <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson crys over 1 week of news media on him,get over it. trumps had negative media on him the whole campaign. trump deals with media way better by firing back like a boss <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Hannity learns martial arts to prepare for that moment he might be confronted with a mass shooter weirdly he doesnt seem to advocate pulling a gun on them.He suggests that he knows Carson is prepared for such a moment yet his only story concerning him being confronted by an armed man involves him suggesting the guy pick on the teller in the restaurant.Such baloney. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The truth is that Obama is a wimp. He is going to destroy our country. He is not a leader. On the other hand, Carson and OReilly make sense. We need more brave men like them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
as a democrate best case scenario is trump or carson wins the primary. The worst case scenario is Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump, Carson and Cruz are the way to go. If the GOP establishment puts someone else on the ticket those 70% of people will stay home. President Hillary anyone? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i was a ron paul guy, but the gop leadership absolutely wasnt going to back him....ditto for rand paul so, now im looking at cruz and carson.....and with one of our biggest problems being the democratic assault on blacks for generations, im strongly leaning toward carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson U r a worthless human <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Maybe Carson deserves negative attention, because hes a complete lunatic? Hes an unprepared candidate, and a dangerous knifewielding religious cult member. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How can you blame the media for calling him out on all the dumb shit hes said?! Hes running for President of the United States, not a high school. Just like Fox News does to Obama, everything he does will be examined microscopically. Pick your words and actions wisely. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media have taken glee at bringing Dr. Carson down a notch. Theyve done their worst. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id take George W Bush over any republican candidate in 2016...Ben Carson, Donald Chump, Ted Cruz...these people are morons. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is totally clueless and so am I, Donald Chump. Ben Carson and I want to tweet ISIS to death...what a moron. This election is already over. Hillary Clinton won <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben carson has pathological problems not fit for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please Ted Cruz is is a rehearsed, silver spoon fake and career politician. What has he done but pound his chest like the rest of the politicians? He crumbles under Washington pressure. He accepts refugees and has done nothing to stop illegal migration. No thanks! Ben Carson is a authentic Christian and has actually lived a life of integrity. God bless Dr. Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He looks calm and collective. Love Dr Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really dont think Ben Carson has the backbone to get us out of this mess. Hes just too soft spoken, but then again that probably doesnt mean anything. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz or Carson for president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im black and from jump said Trump will be the next president of the United States! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Um, has anyone fact checked these stories? Ben Carson lies ALL THE TIME. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio sounds like he thinks Putin is a joke I say thats where he fucked up! Russia has China and North Korea, all Nuke states! World war around the corner! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson knows what hes talking about. He may be the only president that can rescue us from the problems created by Obamacare. in any case, Dr. Carson is extremely qualified for being president, and in helping Americans with affordable healthcaremuch more qualified than President Obama was. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson just does not have it. I have to vote Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Question for trump supporters genuine question, not a gotcha question Should trump decide to run against the republican party as an independent, would he still have your support? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
oh and FOX is pushing CARSON again,no matter if this guy is a space cadet ,JOSEPH built the pyramids to store grain COME ON MAN. FOX news is quickly loosing any credibility they had left. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and Carson supporters just dont give a shit about facts or substance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The biggest disappointment for me was when I found out he lied about being Johnny Carsons brother <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The more people hate, the stronger Trump gets. So, let them pretend to be a little Social Justice Warrior. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

he from that Old group of republicans wich have Bush, Gringrinch, McCain etc, but now we have guys like Rubio, Cruz, Carson, Paul, Christie, guys that are even get the young people, well republicans are comming and they will get every single chair of power in this country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has been right about this all along...and we all knew it. And kelly file was badgering him about thomas jefferson last night! Smarten your acts up, media...or should i say, Medea? The beast is a magazine...a tabloid at best anyway. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Megans enormous pig like nostrils are so distracting that it is hard to concentrate. But her contempt for the 50% of her audience that likes Trump and Carson comes out loud and clear. Her career is over. She could go and join her Leftist Pig Palls at MSNBC and have an audience of 1000 people. By, by rat Megan, millions are scrapping the stink of you off of the bottoms of our shoes. The people who were your biggest supporters now despise you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Tucker Carson is spot on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
normally i would thumbs up a fox news report for their professionalism and quality broadcast, but the title of this video is about Ben Carson. Ben Carson was mentioned for 20 seconds in this video before the host changed subject. what the hell is that. misleading title thumbs down. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Guys. Ben Carson did a good job here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

trump is a joker, carson willbe the next president of the u.s and the world <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
@438 Carson is so stupid that he defends his misquote with another one, thus putting on display his complete and utter incompetence. Jefferson had nothing to do with the drafting of the Constitution. Not only that, but his apparent NPD urges him to turn it all back around on Megyn and lay the blame on her and the media. Comedy gold. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is living proof that surgeons dont need to be intelligent. That is, if he ever really was a surgeon. The man is more of a buffoon than Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great response in the midst of distractions and sensiless controversy! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson keep on Trumpin and watch both of you fall. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I could do a better job than Carson. I wont charge anything except the cost of turning my spare bedroom into an oval office. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
they asked if he saw the cheering in NJ now he says he doesnt know where they were. Yeah right <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson needs to follow the headlines better. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Poor Carson. he is having a tough time. Good man though. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson should remain a surgion. ..hard to find...not a president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In all honesty, I hope Carson gets it. Trump is not for the average Joe. Look what he and his lynchmob did that black man in Birmingham, Al a few days ago? Do you really want someone like that as president that will harbor hatred and shearignorance against common folk? Not to mention he will make it hard on everyone who is currently struggling. Even the middle class. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who is Ben Carson? What is he made of? The more we try to give a bad impression a bad perception there is no effect. I hear he is on free fall he does not respond well on issues, he is incapable etc., yet he keeps on gaining more favor, more voters, more supporters. It is as if the American people knows him better than the media. Correct me if im wrong, what is on mediasocial media does not add up, this Ben Carson guy is winning the polls. Better change strategies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Media say he is on a free fall or he fails to address certain important issues etc., yet he is getting more attention, more support than Trump. Im confused it is as if the American people knows more about Ben Carson than the media.......????? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is awesome, we need a president with his skill, character, and ability. Foreign policy is a strength for Dr. Carson, not a weakness. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the candidate, Fox News keeps trying to drive down Carson and prop up establishment garbage like Jeb and Rubio. #BenCarson #election <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im gonna vote for Hillary. Carson and Trump are way out of their leagues. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson said last week China was operating in Syria and he will bring evidence to show the American people now he is saying he was joking this is not a comic show this is the presidential race well it is a comic show because , Donald Trump is leading for the GOP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is done! ...........................Admitted last week does not know what to do about ISIS................................Please Google Foreign Policy Tests Ben Carson and after watching this interview , you will know he is .....................FINISHED....even his advisers said he wont learn or is incapable.........................and with ISIS trying to infiltrate the USA as we comment right now, you still want to vote for this man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just like Trump, Carson is a lightweight with retarded comments so many inventions came out of the space race LOL. Obama could wipe the floor with either of these childish nutjobs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump leads because the republican party is running idiots like Carson, and Cruz The question is when will Trump drop out of the race to make way for a republican hack <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This lady must be a Creepy Carson supporter as she keeps being wrong about how much Carson is slipping. Its really funny he called her out on the facts of the polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The New York Times for a long time now is like the national enquirer , Propaganda full of outrageous claims and statements ,food for the over emotional FascistCommunist hybrid agenda ...The Paper is actually a Joke ...I would be not Surprised that they claim Carsons running mate is Bat boy , And Trumps vice president would Be the Aliens , etc... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump for president 20162020 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Howard totally asked a normal question but Carson gets all upset, like he thinks its a gotcha question. I hear Creepy Carson is giving away hammers at his next book signing. THUMBS UP above for a job well done by Howard <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has said SO many things that fly past the edge of reality that anyone with half a brain can see hes a fullon, flatout nut job. I dont agree with Lindsay Graham on policy but hes given me no reason to believe hes INSANE. Same with Bush, Kasich, Rubio, or Christie. Cruz is another head case. Whats so wrong with this country that perhaps millions of people either cant see that Carson has fully slipped his mooring or are fine with a lunatic in the White House? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson often comes across as too laid back and sleepy...dare I say...stoned <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bang bang Carsons silver hammer came down, on her head do do do do.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a good guy but not good at foregn policy. I think Carson would be great as vice president. I like Trump for president, Carson for vice president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a brain dead stupid liar. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media and Donald Trump dont have a clue about what kind of a man they are dealing with. For Ben Carson, failure has never been an option. CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The only candidate who has spoken any sense in 6 months . Trump is a salesman , Carson is short of knowledge and Cruz is a preacher . Rubio is Reps best bet to Take HC down . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carsons plan is better. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Well we know fox likes Rubio, but he is much better than Kasich or Carson. But Im for TRUMP 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only 3 people have a shot at beating Clinton Trump, Carson and Rubio if history serves us right Americans like to chose exciting candidates not boring or bland just take a look at the people that loss the presidential race <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats BS Rubio. The Kurds are the ones that have fought the most and want to fight and need supply not Zuni. Itll be the same thing as b4 giving thousands if ammo and supplies and then they turn back on us. NO NO NO !!!. TRUMP 2016 !!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am a democrat and Dr. Carson just knocked a lot of sense in to me. He will be getting my vote. Someone once told me that the more the Government gives you, the more they OWN you. If thats the case a lot of people will be living on their knees down the road. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is truly excellent at avoiding the questions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if I pulled the shit Trump or Carson pulls when I go to a Job interview....they wouldnt call me back. So if youre running for President. ..you Should be widely questioned ! wtf. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
who is Ben Carson talking to he is lost this man is a perfect example of a suspension of intellect <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These Trump and Carson gotchas are an entirely media created crock. And they are only too glad to congratulate themselves for doing it. Once again, they are not reporting news, they are trying to create and fashion it. Screw them. They are all disgusting. And Fred Francis, whom Ive never seen before, is obviously a total hack. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whos running for POTUS? OReilly or Carson? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow Carson is fucking insane. I want a secular conservative! Why dont they exist? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He doesnt know what hes talking about and dont know what to do as President sorry ben your out <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson could be the first black president....and my redneck #%s will gladly vote for him!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Freedom of expression also ask for being responsible for what he says and that is a point Dr. Carson will have no part of. Spewing poison and pure stupidity as he does it needs to be objected too. When the good Dr., with no experience utters such criticism, he disqualifies himself big time! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why dont you just tell Carson what to say since you dont like his answers Wallace! Geez <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson also said that he could not chose between the bible or constitutional law, same concept <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson isnt freefalling.......nor declining <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i love carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HEY ben carson YOUR VOTING FOR TRUMP TOO IM PROUD OF YOU <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is frankly ridiculous <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bottom Line a borderline psychotic retard cant be president. Drop Out Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Other than when he is in surgery, Ben Carson is a knucklehead. He should know religious extremism, since he is that himself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trumps lead mainly increased because more voters went from Carson to Rubio and Cruz. So ultimatly Trumps way to winnin the nomination will depend on how many that drops out. Although I think it is unlikely that any of his top 3 competitors will drop out since they all have very similar numbers so therefore it is very likely that he will win. The wildcard is that there is still around 20% to be had from the remaining candidates though. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this reporter needs to go to acting class...she is so dramatic. Ben carson needs to realize he is black , stop acting white <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey wheres the Republican idiot congressman to yell out you lie. Trump and Carson in the early poll leads is nothing but a rouse on the behalf of the Repuglicans. Everyone knows these two candidate are polarizing and garner all the headlines, which allow the real candidates to maneuver very quietly. You have to be some kind of idiot to vote for Carson or Trump. Again we are talking about Republicans. Cruz, Bush or Rubio and not Fat boy in little coat Christie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump never said he wanted a Muslim database .... he said he wanted a database of Syrian refugees ...... the media is being dishonest ... AGAIN .... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does Carson remind you of anyone? Quiet, unassuming, softspoken, mild mannered......then, can go berserk at any moment and come at you with a hammer or knife.......Hannibal Lecter maybe? Just a thought. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who is the lady in red behind Carson around 028? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am not religious, but I like Carson. He is absolutely right, settle them in their part of the world. We have to accept we live in an open society and cannot risk a leak in the backround checks that we cannot trust to be accurate. 1 terrorist could means hundreds of lives...I would really like to see CarsonRubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nobody running has served in the military. Carson will rebound. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
With idiots like Donald Trump and Ben Carson will only help to recruit more people around the world to join and fight for ISIS. The republican congress and some state governors are are ready helping ISIS with their bigotry and show of ignorance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Europe is on the frontline of ISIS attacks. Their governments policies are obviously not working either, however, its all Obamas fault......Yeah ok, Bill OReilly. And, the fact that you bring on the guy Carson, who obviously has only heard of Paris or France because of this tragedy is comical. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What annoys me about Ben Carson? Nothing really personal. You just shouldnt let an apparently unteachable moron be in charge of the worlds biggest military. It would be deeply irresponsible to vote this man into power. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well said Dr. Carson! My favorite thing about this man whether you agree with him or not, he is not afraid to tell the truth! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hah! I knew they were going to use the rabid dog analogy without listening to the entire statement. Carson is an easy target for media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hitem hard Juan, she dont like being called out of the Bullshit she sucking up to Donald Duck Trump... Keep up the good work Juan. Call these dumb ducks of their Bull Shit and racists comments..

GOOD, the more the media attacks Trump, the higher his poll numbers go. The more the other candidates attack Trump, the lower their poll numbers go. Carson will drop to less than 10% while Trump will go to 50% in the polls after this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is Fox showing an edited video without context? Im not even a Trump supporter but this is bullshit. Show the question being asked first before he answered. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
JUST MY OPINION Ben Carson is SLOW and soft. Right now our country is not in the market for wishy washy religious candidates. They tend to inject too much compassion into their agendas. This will NOT WORK! We need someone with some geopolitical experience and who does not care about being politically correct. That candidate is TRUMP!!!! There is a time to be compassionate. Right now compassion can get us killed! We need BALLS! Period! Obama Has NO Balls! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How can a brain surgeon be incapable of learning ? LOL. ....what a joker The Donald is. ......and so utterly off base, and such a disgusting arrogant juvenile loudmouth. .....absolutely nothing Presidential about this thug. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

That lady has a penchant for Trumps comments. What about Carsons call for all Imams to cooperate? This lady really does not like Mr. Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is an emotional crackpot. From his interviews I gather an emotional drama queen who gets violent when in private, ego like a bus, and passive aggressive. No leader should be passive aggressive, certainly no POTUS. It puts the lotion on its skin comes to mind <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Know what else is dangerous? Having a religious zealot in office. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson has a winning plan to fight ISIS. His Big Ben padlock bomb would combine 100,000 of high explosives with 2,000,000 Master padlocks to obliterate all life in 100 square miles of Syria. We just have to hope ISIS does not have belts they can hide behind.....Go Bennie!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
is this repetitive news or has Carson stuck on his life story book? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These pundits still dont get it. Experiences? What governor has foreign policy experience? Sorry but Trump has more experience in dealing with foreign grubbernments. EvenDr Carson has as much experience as governors have. Republican party needs to focus on the do nothing Congress. Those asses are going to loose 2016 for Republicans. Just YES men for Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character that is the goal of true education. Msrtin Luther King Jr. Dr. Ben Carson has both education and character unlike most poliicians. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
youre weak and dont apprciate a man , a good man for the precidency. is Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

How stupid are Carson supporters? Holy shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016. Fox was defending carson. but trump is a real leader. we need a wall, deport illegals, build up our military, and wipe isis off the earth and hunt them down like Nazis after ww2 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OReily is still the armchair tough guy who has to lie about the the dangerous situations he faced in his cushy life as a TV talking head and Carson is a brain surgeon, a highly demanding technical field that mastering leaves no time or ability to learn anything about anything else. This video was a complete waste of time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is smart man BUT has no leadership skills. . its obvious Carson s words in this interview was coached. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
is OReilly running for president or Carson? geez let the man speak. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Carson is willing to start a war with Russia over the cluster fuck in Syria? Its unbelievable that hes a front runner. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Am I the only one noticing Ben Carsons reptilian eyes? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is insane hopefully people will see that... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons lack of foreign policy knowledge will be his downfall against Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so if you know the answer, why are you asking the question you dummie ,he just wants Dr carson to say what he wants to hear <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
we are letting in a Trojan horse <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Church of the fly spaghetti.. Sounds like something Ben Carson would be part of. Look into the SeventhDay Adventist church that Carsons faith is based off of, coo coo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is an imbecile and these problems are a direct and predictable consequence of Bushs decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Look at Jeb!s poll numbers if you think Bush is not getting blamed for this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is useless.he always points the fingers at someone else.cant take the blame for his own mistakes and stupidity <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Have mercy on us Mr OReilly. Getting foreign policy strategy from Carson? Carson is clueless as this video shows. Maybe that was your intent, to show how clueless he is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look Republican Obama took down ramie and Carson will take down Trump watch out knowledge vs wealth filth <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson deserves the presidency Trump is a slandered and a bloated narsisist bloat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I love dr carson and he is a smart man, but all his comments was i think well buddy, I think u are not knowledable enough on the topic better politics all at. what tyou gonna do....operate on isis brains to make them act right? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jindal is a good Gov for LA. Hes fact smart. Detailed. Hes NO dummy...But because of the anger that a lot of us have...Trump Carson look good to a lot of us...Good Luck to him GOD bless you, Bobby...But I think in the end its either RubioCruz.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson.. Sounds mentally retarded... he wont comment on trump because trump will crucify him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

For a man that publicizes that he is a devout Christian as much as Carson, it surprises me that he is not in favor of helping these Syrian refugees. Then again we see this time and time again with religion, it only being used for publicity points or personal gain. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

if Ben Carson would of said that, he would of gotten hell from the media and Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love how people think he isnt relevant. He is a very dangerous individual and sadly will at some point in time be a President. The Bush family isnt going anywhere, do people not know that history repeats?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People shouldnt be so worried about Carson or Trump. They should be worried about Hillary Clinton getting into office. That would just be terrible. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That was a good interview with OReilly. Sometimes OReilly can get seriously irritating but this time it was pretty good. I think that Ben Carsons run for the White House is pretty much over. Maybe something might happen to restore things. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i think the republicans will actually win the election if Trump and Dr. Carson start working together rather than against each other. I dont care which one is president and which one is the VP, but i really hope they can set aside any differences that they might have in order to work together. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Mariah, thats because when u add religion to something there is a good chance all logic reason have been thrown out of the window. The actions u describe are of irrationality brought on by unsubstantiated dogma is really quite silly especially in the 21st century. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON sounds so WEAK but I do like him in TRUMPS Administration. We need a loudmouth ball buster son of a gun to run America and put all these countries back into place. Donald Trump is the only one that can do this. GO TRUMP! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON is nice but hes too LOW ENERGY. You think the Chinese Augies Islamic terrorists are going to sit down with this freaking guy? Please do me a favor CARSON is great for the administration but he is not good enough to be president.GO TRUMP 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He would try to stab them and fail. Ben Carson is an idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I know more about foreign policy and history than Ben Carson. And Im flipping burgers at McDonalds <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Business is the second discipline to embrace Strategy that first started in the military. Mr. Trump is well versed on Strategy compared to Dr. Carson who is not in any way exposed to any competitive environment is a bigger scale. Your insinuation that he is an entertainer is total bullshit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is such a political moron he doesnt realize he s not running against Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this dude is dumb. Carson get your facts right....... he doesnt think shit out. I use to like him... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
only cause Carson cant answer questions and its like he has no plan. why are ppl liking him, what plans does he have? trump actually delivered plans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
god!!!! Carson is retarded! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama hates republicans more than illegal aliens and radical Muslims. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Protect our America Protect our children <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How to vette in a few minutes ... offer them a Bacon and Ham lettuce and Tomato sandwich, a cup of wine, and invite them to join in with you in the Lords prayer ... thats a quick way to tell who is who and what is what. A Muslim will not knowingly and willingly eat pork and die in hell, nor will they Pray to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its crazy, these Fox viewers are an embodiment of hate. The fact that someone as ignorant as Carson was on the lead is depressing. We need to enhance our education system. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is too stupid to answer question. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
cant arson the Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont want a fucking lunatic with our launch codes. VOTE FOR ANYONE BUT CARSON. He even denies evolution. Its apparent that he is delusional and mentally inproficient <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson seems dense and incapable of responding to Wallaces easy question about who would you call as part of an international alliance. Bizzare. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is spot on with his strategy here. We need to put pressure on the clerics to disavow what ISIS is doing. Unless this is done, radical groups could pop up anywhere eg France. The Interviewer doesnt understand Carsons strategy even though he clearly stated it, which is to get ALL the allies and Arab states on board with this plan. Its not a matter of calling ONE country to solve the problem. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It will be a toss up between Trump and Rubio at the end. Carson and Cruz are too religious, most moderate voters dont like mixing faith with policy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It never was an never will be his time. Hes a disgrace to his own people, and a man whos ashamed of his heritage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im glad that that guy said something about carson being a changed man because Trump have been quoting the words from Carsons book in present tense. Hes been hammering Carson with his past as if Carson is still the same guy that he used to be. Plus, he was a teenager at the time! He has been able to hold himself in check for 50 years so far. I know that its all a competition, but Trump needs to find some new material to use against Carson if he even have any. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He sounds stupid when he says well, I dont know what happened. He is willing to go after Carson for the negatives in his past that he admitted openly to talk about how he overcame them but Trump is not willing to talk about the obvious positive parts of his life, just saying I dont know when theyre pointed out. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He might not be politically accurate but he does have the leadership drive to rally right commanders to deal with the terrorism in the middle east. Go Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone who votes for Carson is nuttier than Carson himself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anniepies...I agree with Ben Carson trusting in God...God made heaven and earth hes Almighty, no man put the sun up in the sky or the star, only Almighty God... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is clearly too smart and too good of a person for the White House. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Can we vote to take away Obama citizenship? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Pray for Dr. Carson to be our next Commander in Chief. Realize how much he is needed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Turks are supporting ISIL you idiot. I hate how Obama supports them now and Carson wants to get back at ISIS by getting closer to an ISIS sympathizer? As a Christian person, are you aware of the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks? What a fucktard. How is he still running? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Of course, draftdodging Trump is a better man than Carson, who was in the ROTC. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Carson is a little crazy...we all are, its that s... They are spraying in the air. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How on earth does anyone see humility in Carson? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow. Carson really went there. He gave the Sarah Palin all of them response. It makes me sick and sad that there are Americans who support this dunce simply because he blows the Jesus dog whistle. FUCK! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Because Carson is known for being so full of energy that restraint is needed, right? He got flipped over and handled like a bitch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a joke, like what kind of personality does he have? confused afro American douche bag <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is falling in the polls and Fox news is trying to help him, its not going to work people found out Carson is crazy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is less Christian than Carson, obviously. When he mentioned it means nothing to me. Trump does NOT live or appear faith in anything but money and self. And OReiley is an idiot. I go on the issues! I wouldnt vote for either to be candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OReilly is a book author masquerading as a TV host. Selling paper pulp to gullible fox news viewers. Ben Carson is doing the same.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There are closeup photos on the internet of Obamas wedding ring. It has distinct Islamic symbolism on it. The S. O. B. should be booted out of the Whitehouse immediately. Disgraceful he was even elected to begin with. Shows what fools Americans can be. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The world needs more Atheists skeptical people, thinking people who doubt religion and brainless claims. Carson cant survive it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON FAVORITE BIBLE VERSES IS PROVERB 3 56 PROVERB 22 4 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 5144 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go BEN Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Brace yourselves Republicans! If Carsons mindblowing stupidity makes its way through your national convention, you may want to kiss your Congressional majorities goodbye! Seriously, if youre going to nominate someone, nominate someone with a brain, like Rubio or Bush....maybe Kasich. Even Ted Cruz is pretty brilliant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson sounds like the kid who smoked a bowl before a class presentation trying to keep his shit together in front of the class <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON CARSON CARSON CARSON <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson was offered an appointment to West Point. Which he did not accep <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Chris Wallace is too liberal to be on Fox News, its time to get rid of him. He is way too biased with a lot of stupid gotcha questions. None of them worked this time around. Great job Ben. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont think Carson could combat a house fly, let alone terrorists. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
how can anyone vote for Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson doesnt have horsepower, Hillary will eat him alive. Only Trump can defeat her <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You people you goons hate France remember freedom Fries? Fake News said the french were cowards and in the way. Now Fake news is worried about France.Any one in the goon gallery know what crocodile tears are? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson shoot them Russians down...haha. Nothing like WW III to help with global warming. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn, first call on Saudi Arabia to stop funding ISIS would be a good start. Why doesnt Carson at least say that instead of saying that the US will go at it alone until people get on board? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Try about 95 seconds on Ben Carson on what Carson said about himself. Trump was right on point the entire speech so stop lying Kurtz. You sound like you didnt even watch the speech so when people watch and hear how much of a liar you are, you lose support and Trump gains. At least at the end you admitted that Trump is better than everyone else so they need to hide. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The press gets serious about terror yeah cause Dr. Carson just want to make ISIS losers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The most level headed, educated and honest candidate. This man should be President. Dr. Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP IS VERY TRUE . YES ,THERE ARE SO MANY FUCKIN STUPID PEOPLE TO BELIEVE SLEEPING CARSONS BOLSHEDS... TRUMP IS SO RIGHT ABOUT THEM, AND YOU GOT BURNED ASS JUST BECAUSE NO ONE TOLD YOU YOUR TRUTH TO YOUR FUCKIN FACES OPENLY BEFORE . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Give up Carson doesnt have a clue what he would do!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Carson would gather all of his sheep and go to church and pray for peace!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i will say Trump seems to be the most competent Republican candidate for sure hell Im a Democrat and I may vote for him lol Ben Carson sort of scares me hes so damn religious and we really need a separation of church and state especially in this day and age <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When someone has ALL THE ANSWERS beware! I like Dr. Carson because I believe he will operate in the wisdom of Proverbs 246 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war and in multitude of counsellors there is safety. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So far, just because Trump speaks without political correctness, the liberals start jumping out of their windows with disbelief..How could he say such a thing? What is wrong in this day and time of confusion, to speak the facts, broken down so even stupid people can understand.. Ben Carson admitted to his condition , and in FACT it is not curable..call the spade, a spade <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If youre going to elect someone the most powerful person in the world youd have to be certifiably insane to want a pathological liar like Carson as president. But of course Conservatives only care about lies if theyre not their variety of lies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im an Australian and I am absolutely appalled at the childish basicness and simplicity that these Republican related political debates are at! Carson and Trump are clearly uninformed idiots on foreign policy. I think a lot of right wing Americans would be clueless about what is being said on British or Australian political forums about the same issue... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson just wants America to be run like a theocracy with everything basically under Biblical control and try to employ that insane flat tax that anyone with more than a 3rd grade education knows is insane. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doesnt take media bias to make Carson look dumb. He just opens his mouth out comes the stupid! Keep it up! Bernie Sanders 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a liar. Hey Carson, nice rap! Loser <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is scary!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TrumpCarson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is ignorant. He has no knowledge of any of the important issues. I am not going to go into those issues, but seriously anyone voting for this guy need to have their head checked. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This news reporter IS MISINFORMED, Howard Kurtz carries on on about some untruths. Trump didnt go on for 95mins about Ben Carson, I watched the speech from beginning to end. Our only hope is Trump for President and SOON !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wakeup folks! We have NATO to fight with us. First, our President must use our military effectively. Next, the President must activate ALL of the NATO resources they have been too slow responding. Wallace, usually good man, is off base with this time. Carson is well aware of the action needed. He would take actions. Why has our President been ineffective for seven years? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You go Mr Carson...Ben for President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
but but but.. Ben Carson is stupid and racist and Jews are evil? thats what i learned in college and from teh media! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
someone needs to keep america safe from idiots like ben carson ,and the idiots who support him,he never answers questions,and cant stop lying <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if you guys in the states are serious about ISIS , you need trump carson in office ... perfect mix of action and insight <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It should have been Carson to have had the honor of being the first black president. The country would be very different now imo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
republicans are the best, we can invade any countries we want. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson has no clue how to kill isis, he has never fought in war <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson was excellent.... Chris you just ok... Annoying is not a prerequisite for a good interviewer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Very good answer Ben Carson you have my vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trump and rand paul have basically the same foreign policy. rand just doesnt want to waste money. our military is ten times stronger then russia and china but were scared of isis. makes no sense. rand is just saying we gotta pay for our military not borrow which makes sense to me we have 20 trillion in debt already smh <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wasnt Trump just saying that Carson was having to defend himself with what he himself wrote in his own book? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He doesnt answer the question and what he does say makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. For crying out loud. Listen to him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson says birFday.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson has this issue right. Im glad hes running for President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
it looks like the gay network of homosexual journalists have went to work on ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny because for a non politician, he gives a lot of political answers. I like Carson, but couldnt he have just said Ill call the British first, or whoever when the guy kept asking him? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol, doesnt sound like Ben Carson has any answers. Sidestepping the questions. lol. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Donald Trump, but i wish he would shut up about Carson. I understand he is low energy, and he is way too nice, but going after him for stuff he said he did when he was 14 years old?...Come on Donald... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
chris Wallace needs to stop being bias.. I only see him grilling Ben Carson with tough questions.. Go back and look at his interview with Donald trump. He got softball questions.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have some respect for fox and Megan. I am sure Dr Carson did not realize all the garbage he was in for. This must be a terrible disappointment for a man I look up to. Dr Carson by running for POTUS you will be dealing with the most evil people in the world. you have already contributed greatly as some of the other took your ideas. Ted Cruz is for a 10 percent tax. Prayers and hang in there Dr Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I find so odd that when you Google Hillary Clinton name, theres little to no negative, smear and attack articles about her, but when you good Ben Carson name theres a theme park of smear articles about him.. Why would the media want a pathological liar like Hillary in office? what do they get out of this? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Chris Matthews tried and tried and tried to get him to answer question he is not fit for the highest office. Go home Dr. Carson run for your local school Board. Come back in 10 years. Seriously do not want this man to have the codes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is the only guy whos actually realized that the problem is the religion itself is the cause of the problem, islam needs to be revised their religious leaders need to actively participate in the reformation of islam in a very public and authoritarian way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson seems so lost! Great doctor but definitely NOT president material. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kasich is awesome. Hes reasonable on social issues, and to the right on foreign policy. Thats exactly where you want to be in the general election. However, to win the nomination, you either need to be far right or you need to be really well known. Hes neither. If he ran in 2012, he would probably be the favorite to win the nomination now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr. Trump, stay away from Ben Carson, what he wrote and his book.. .that is not relevant for this election.... . please Mr. Trump.. just focus on on your agenda.. this will help you to get the Repub nomination...and subsequently POTUS... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I get the feeling that Ben Carson thinks the real world is just a video game like call of duty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hahaha lightening round, to try and get some quick answers lol with Ben Carson...tough task. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Let me preface this by saying I am a republican. Hell, that is why I am on Fox News at the moment. I am voting for Dr. Carson or whomever the republican candidate winds up being, but Hilary Clinton was absolutely correct in stating that the United States cannot fight this battle alone. We will never emerge successful fighting a nonstanding group of jihadists that range across an entire region. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Of course, Politico and CNN are Leftleaning and want to destroy Carson. As to the Wall Street Journal, it favors a K Street Republican such as amnestyloving Jeb. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is creepy......seems to have that Dr. Jykle Mr. Hyde thing going on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A commander in chief that actually listens to his military advisors on how to fight a war? What an interesting concept. Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate that cunt Clinton so I want the GOP in the White House in 17. Carson is a brilliant doctor and a retarded policymaker. Primary voters, DITCH THIS SARAH PALIN EQUIVALENT. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Foxnews Fair balanced ONLY for conservatives. The message always ends defending right wing propoganda. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is creepy.......fighting the mental war inside his head. He shouldnt even be in the presidential race. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fox and the other republicans want hillary to win because they realize that sanders has a better change against fools like carson and trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Chris Wallace aint no joke..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The French, Brits, Germans, and other countries that have allowed the jihadists inside the gates because the people are not allowed to carry arms. Canada will also be screwed because Canada has antigun laws and the new PM, Trudeau, is calling for a gun registry making it illegal to even carry hunting rifles without a registration. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has become very calm lately. I wonder why? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson isnt concerned with facts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Okay existence of inner city problems means that one major national problem of police and governmental abuse of power does not exist? Im starting to think that someone needs to conduct neurosurgery on your sycophantic brain Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump ended this dufus on Thursday. It wasnt the media, it was The Donald. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is why Carson is surging again. Journalists must never report stuff without gathering all the facts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is violent himself. He cant judge on that one. Funny how white folks loved big gov when they got FHA, GI Bills and free land when blacks couldnt. Now they hate big government? Yeah right. The military is half the budget. The reason this generation of Republicans are hated by blacks is because they are the racist former dems who switched flags due to the Civil Rights bill. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
well the blood is in the hands of american youppie liberals ,the democrazeeniks..doctor mr Carson is a nice man but America needs a Sheriff Mr Trump..the Paris attack is a coward vengeance. ISIS is loosing this war hit after hit.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson and Donald Trump are both amateurs, the American people will never trust the country with an amateur so that leaves the Presidency for Hillary Clinton period. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Seriously bill are you and your employer so desperate to find what you constitute for news you desperately search for the truth in a story told over a cup of coffee at a diner? Anyways the difference between the story Clinton told and the story carrson told is Clinton did not use her story to help prop up her campaign. Carson made up some bs story to play the violent kid who was from the getto grew to find God and become a docters which was bullshit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump was quoting Carson re pathological. This is just the latest Fox attempt to destroy Trump. It wont work either. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson almost hit his mother over the head because he didnt like a pair of pants. He punched his friend in the face for changing a radio station, He tried to stab his school friend or family member. Fourteen is old enough to know better. Hopefully U.S. voters will know better than to elect him. Hopefully, its not rigged. Perhaps he is in control for usual life situations but Carson is not someone who should be entrusted with the nuclear button. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Carson has a strong chance against Hillary Clinton. Americans are so fed up with frivilous power hungry leftists, they want someone whos proven himself in at least one career. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is getting boring....All he does is criticize and hes never serious....I have changed my mind about him Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I had no idea Ben Carson had a movie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump tries to put every down ,id rather believe a man like Ben Carson who made a change in his life and became a world famous brain surgeon saving many children, and peoples lives.

Egyptian antiquities officials have scoffed at claims by the Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson that Egypt ancient pyramids were not built as pharaonic tombs but used to store grain. this guy is running for leader of the free world,as an AMERICAN I am embarrassed,AND FOX IS STILL HYPING THIS GUY,ANYTHING TO MAKE A DOLLAR ,SHAME ON FOX NEWS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Isnt it crazy how Bernie Sanders cares more about black people than Ben Carson?? SMH fuck this Uncle Tom. #FeelTheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is extremely smart and extremely humble. We need a smart person as our President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So are you telling me that they cant find crap on Trump? Yeah right! Give me a break. Carson wrote a book talking about the odds against him and how he dealt with those odds. Sounds honest to me. He protected the identity of those involved by using a third party. Carson has ten times the integrity as Trump and 1000 times the integrity of the media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
all go read your j.carson tea bags. lol and paint your valentine hearts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im impressed that Carson was able to obtain 2nd place in the GOP race considering hes been sleepwalking the whole time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If you pay attention, you can hear Ben Carson speaking and snoring at the same time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I saw the gifted hands documentary with Ben Carson that came out in the 80s and there was a clip of him telling the same stories about his violence when he was a kid. So if you decide that hes been lying in the last few years for political gain, then you have to accept that hes been planning the run for presidency since the 80s. Mainstream media just trying to bring up shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Americans are totally nuts. the story ought to be Investigation reveals candidate attempted to stab and murder someone as a teenager and he denies it. Instead, we have, believe it or not Candidate claims he tried to stab someone as a teenager and the media denies it ever happened. How bloody stupid is America? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How come we americans are so exceptional, yet when soemone tells us the truth we wont accept it? Carson is a liar about the belt buckle. Trump is right about the wall Carson will fade once people wake up, and it will be one establishment guy vs trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Rubio is stupid for being a towtheline global warming denier, but he could make a decent President on complex issues like this. Hes a heck of a lot more refined than clowns like Trump and Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He didnt compare Carson to a child molester. He used a child molester as an example of being pathological because its possibly the only example that an average voter can understand. The problem is, the sound bites carry louder than what he was actually trying to say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
well Kareem can shoot a hook shot and Carson can perform life saving brain surgery. hmmmmm <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson..... Why not ?? WELCOME TO THE FREEK SHOW!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You the man Dr. Carson!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am a very honest person, and I got full scholarships from all the Ivy league schools, even though I never ever applied. Harvard even offered me 2 million dollars, but I said NO, because I love North Illinois University. Sorry, I cant provide the proof. All the people offered me verbally. I cant remember any of their names. Once again, I am a very honest person, just like Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I didnt wacth the show. i came here becuase i thought there was news about him and ben carson. Ben carson is crazier than trump, who amits of doing violence and worst of all, towards thier own family. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016 we dig him hes real <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
you racists think by endorsing this coon , as you call us, that you will get the black vote. news flash ! he is the sure way to losing the black vote. dont you guys have another black friend bendover carson is a weirdo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
After the terrorists bombings in France today, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CARSON, RUBIO, HILLARY, .....Keep laughing at Trumps NOAMNESTY to illegals and Islamic refugees.......Keep laughing at Trumps WALL!. .........Keep laughing CARSON, RUBIO, HILLARY <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is better than Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
love Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Did Carson get kicked in the head by a donkey or something? What is wrong with him? Listen to him speak... He seriously sounds like he has brain damage or really really drunk <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who cares what Carson did in his youth the main thing that he sick now.... not good to be a president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
and Trump did say Carson was pathological he said just what Carson said about him self in his book just because Carson has turned into a pathological liar has nothing to do with what Trump said about him, its just Carson coming out and showing his true self......just could not keep it under raps long enough to get in......THANK GOD <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson looks excited about his secret sources <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a god damned liar. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson thinks racism is so yesterday. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Let his kid or friend come at him with a hammer or knife, both crimes and attempted assaults, trying too attack him. But in court, tells the judge they are healed and see how forgiving he would be. They know they will have trouble selling an abusive, psychotic, candidate like Ben Carson in a general election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only it is not mocking God. A zebra doesnt change his stripes. Bens volatile nature was who he was, for not just one incident. Ben Carson defends his past actions in a very creepy matter of fact, no remorse tone. Are we supposed to just take his word for it? Why isnt his mother or wife speaking out on his domestic violence? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Democrat debates will be too boring for the Fox News viewers because they actually talk about policies unlike the Republicans which are just clownish shouting matches for which they wont even take part in proper debates anymore since they demanded the media stop asking proper questions and doing fact checking of the constant lies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
China in Syria was Carsona last flub. Dr yes, but still a clueless twit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carly knows she has no career after this campaign so she is trying to suck up to Carson to maybe try and get a spot in Carsons administration if he gets it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson and Marco Rubio act like we are going to round them ALL up in 30 days and throw them across the border. Opponents are quick to Invent a Worse Case Scenario ! Nice try! President Trump is correct. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
China in Syria... Carson is a clueless twit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LIAR LIAR LIAR CARSON IS A LIAR LIAR LIAR ,he lost all his credibility in his autobiography and now nobody can trust him ! All them FAT wiggly lips of Carson speak out is lies ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
is 4 bankruptcies really something to ignore? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is falling out of favor with the American public and he knows it. Hes now just making noise. If he keeps attacking Carson, he will alienate a lot of conservatives. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Trump speech was not his best. Trump should not go that way. It will backfire. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
gays and racists are doing anything in their power to stop Carson and its not working <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If I were President, Id fucking abolish FoxNews because isnt a legitimate news program. Its just rightwing propaganda with insufferable people feeding viewers bullshit 247. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol Ben Carson like a Child Molester. Good one Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fiorina isnt a real woman. Ben Carson isnt really black. Cruz and Rubio are not real hispanics...... The GOP is nothing but old white male rapist pedo monsters who want to chain all women to a kitchen sink, murder all minorities, and get mad at people just for killing babies! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is stupid and immature... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson looks like he lost all his nerve cells while working as a neurosurgeon <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I was for trump until he said that about carson and pathological anger of his youth, from his biography. Carson used the word but did not say he was diagnosed. Plus the word can be used informally to indicate habitual or compulsive. Then he went on to accuse carson of not being saved.... When someone behaves like this I have to wonder about them. I am pretty sure I choose cruz now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I LIKE IKE. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you do not take Ben Carson than you are more stupide than th world thinks <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The mainstream media is filled with candyassed liberal cupcakes. They attack Carson, yet protect hillarys sorry ass, and the feckless prez, too. I hate to say it, but this nation is filled with too many dumbass gullible people who dont know any better.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson brushes off racism as being politically incorrect. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Many of these people see racism where there is no racism. This is a mental illness. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson? President? Must be joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Where does Hannity find these damn house Negroes? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul won the last debate, second was cruz followed by Trump. Rubio was the biggest joke on stage and should not be in the Republican party. Rubio being such a commie globalist douchebag makes Carson look far better than he performed. Rubio and Chris Christie need to be kicked out of the party altogether. They are a complete joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is NO CHRISTIAN! He will be horrible for this country he is 100% establishment TRUMP 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just like when Trump and Carson complained about the debate time and Fox give into their demands <#urls:0> <+emoji:3> <-emoji:0>
wow, it is sexist to investigate clinton while it is expected to investigate carson. Is that lady for real? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson for President 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bll you are so racist and always will, Carson did not vanish, HE DID VERY WELL ON THE DEBATE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hannity is fucking retarded if he thinks Obama is whining. The bitch republicans are whining about msnbc <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DONT YOU KNOW THAT FOX AND CNN TWIST WORDS ..CARSON IS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE CHANGED FROM WHEN HE WAS RAISED AS A BLACK PERSON .THEY ALL ROB STORES AND LOTS IN JAIL. SO BY GETTING A GOOD EDUCATION THINGS HAVE CHANGED <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go ahead Republicans, elect a noodle brained plutocrattheocrat for your nominee for President. He cant win 270 electoral college votes. Going to be putting up a substantial bet against carson for president on my gambling website. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What was the point of having Kareem on? He offered some extremely vague concerns and criticisms of Dr. Carson and then Megyn starts to kiss his feet. It looks very much like Fox is subtly working to undermine Dr. Carsons candidacy. Interesting...but not, I think, surprising. They have their man and Carson aint it. This doesnt diminish Carson in my mind, but Fox News. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just goes to show you how out of touch the media is when it comes to the American people. Ben Carson! We dont want another head bobble politician that is in Washington. Fox, I want to hear what the candidates have to think about Obama bringing thousands of migrants over from the middle east? My state is getting Thirtythousand? Ill be personally campaigning again my representatives. These Aholes check themselves out the door. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Faith is stupid. Ben Carson shouldnt have any. Nor should Fox News, or anybody. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP IS TALKING IRRESPONSIBLY ABOUT THINGS BEYOND HIS EXPERTISE. CAN YOU TRUST THAT SHITFACE? CONTRAST HIS ILLBRED MANNERS AND BULLSHIT WITH BEN CARSONS IRREPROACHABLE MORAL POWER AND SHINING BRILLIANCE, AND ROCKHARD PRINCIPLES. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Carsons favorite verses are about trusting god and not worrying about anything else.... Thats scary as all hell. As an SDA he believes he is in the end times and as president he thinks he will likely usher in Armageddon. The man is dangerous. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson and Kim Davis want to turn the Unites States into a literal hellhole where women are treated like cattle, gays and lesbians are treated like 2nd class citizens, and have our once great country, full of many different cultures and beliefs turned into a place under Christian Sharia law. Fuck that! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
im hoping for CarsonTrump. Carson can take care of the social things and Trump, takes charge of economy. He would do the business. But we need a wise person on the big chair. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In 1988 Carsons mother disputed what he said and said she was the one that tried to attack him with a hammer in a dispute over a pair of pants. This story is getting more and more confusing and I dont know what to believe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder of Dr. Carson is aware he looks like a GQ cover... hands down, would be one of the best looking presidents, possibly ever... just saying. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is honestly pathological. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson doesnt have to answer anything bravely or disagree because Bill OReilly makes it safe for him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How is Bill OReilly a journalist? Lately every interview and speech defy the ethics he would have learned in school. He basically puts the answers to all of his questions in Ben Carsons mouth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson just repeating God will.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio like Obama has the style to talk in debate but really nothing else. Like Obama the young Rubio has no track records to speak of and very little experiences. Like Obama Rubio would be very incompetent as President. Trump with Ben Carson as running mate would be awesome and will definitely make America Great Again! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Never been wild about Bill OReilly anyway, but he needs to realize that, for people like me and the millions of others that have jumped on Carson bandwagon, hes only hurting himself when he goes after Carson on issues that have already been walked back by outlets like Politico. Pull this video Bill and catch up with the rest of the field. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson should be attacked on his mythological views. He is a deluded christian idiot. A person who doesnt accept the settled science of Evolution has no business running for office. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is too soft and quite. Hed get run over by putin. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben is the Lefts worst nightmare. Hes religious, doesnt speak politically correct, is well educated, and has a rags to riches story. America is sick and needs a doctor. Ben Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This whole story makes me sick. By ANY measure, Carson is a solid dude, a good guy ...and THAT is why the leftists must work harder than ever to destroy him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a dumbass ventriloquist dummy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ive been saying this for too long. I tell black people all the the time its much easier to change what youre doing than to change what another is doing personal responsibility. And Dr Carson is right, there are people out there that prefer other groups of people to remain in that victimized state. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Blaming the victim, same ole spin these two are just enablers of violence, then Carson pretends to be a victim of growing up in the hood, yet he says he stabbed a kid <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump did not know that Ben Carson always been a very religious men,!!!!! Just because Trump has been spending his life on tv programs and changing wives, self centred selfishness building an empire that never did any good to any one!!! Ben Carson has books, is well know at SDA church all over the world, respected and loved for his humanitarian work, he is an missionary always been!!! And I do feel for USA because they dont know what wait for then when voting on Trump!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id love to hear more about this Rand Paul guy. He seems to have a head on his shoulders... Maybe Rand Paul 2016? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love ben carson. If I wasnt supporting Trump I would vote for him. TrumpCarson 2016? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
John Kasich was great, sorry that he was too boring to understand. He needed to interrupt and make an impression in order to get his poll numbers up, since this is what is apparently giving Ben Carson and Donald Trump an edge. He is one of the most reasonable GOP candidates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carsons war on the media??? Dont you mean the medias war on Carson? The latter seems far more accurate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CANADA CALLING, READ THE BELOW COMMENT, AND DONT NOMINATE CARSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON is a fuking psycho. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Actually Im not even a fan of Ben Carson but that Cair guy should be forced to resign because he is unfit. Using his position to tell someone to drop out??? They need to cancel their nonprofit status. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This just in Its been discovered that in 1974 Ben Carson once called of work, to study for an exam. What kind of man does that? Can we really trust a man who calls out of work just to study? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Totally won me over, Rand Paul 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bill ORilley likes Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is awesome <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a SELLOUT who supports amnesty, TPP, and Puerto Rican statehood which would add 2 Dem senators and several more Dem representatives. I have no idea why any selfrespecting conservative would support him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
when you Are running for the highest office in the nation..Your life is a open book... good or bad... Ben Carson could have set the record Straight but he willfullydecided not too....So now hehas to dealwith the media.... ifthe mediafinds somethingelse on another Candidate then it is openseason for them as well..... he should have Known when he decided toRun that he was puttinghis life out there! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Carson, Rubio and Cruz. They are the best. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Are these people paid to say these things about the republican candidates? Nobody who watched that debate would ask if Carson was there? Carson had the most memorable moments. Whats wrong with these people? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a liar he never went to West Point Military academy ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
to answer Ben Carson question.... I think he is lying about his Past. Either way it goes the truth will come out! I wonder what he is going to say when it does. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a good man <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is Lame <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Were they tough questions? Practically every question asked was merely an insult disguised as a question. Notice how the most insulting question that Carly Fiorina was asked just happened to come from the female media puppet. It was a travesty. That moderator attacked Ben Carsons credibility and then asks if it reflects at all on his credibility. How is that tough? Its just insulting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
btw did I mention Carson for 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
big thing about Carson is from his medical mafia background as a neurosurgeon he will support Big Pharma and he has stated he is for mandatory vaccines which ANY FREE person is for personal choice when it comes to putting known harmful chemicals into ones own body. PRO CHOICE should be anyones choice for abortion or vaccines. we as individuals should have the choice to chose what to do with our own bodies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Looked like someone was feeding Ben Carson the answers into an ear piece. Every time he was asked a question he closed his eyes and then popped them open! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if john kasich was the nominee, democrats would be really really scared... REALLY?!! what type of mind games are you trying to play dude?... you think americans are stupid babies, dont you? if kasich gets the nomination, clinton is as good as president. you know that, i know that, everyone knows that. so dont come in here and try to play us for fools with your OOH, DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY SCARED OF KASICH, HES THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN POSE A THREAT TO HILLARY CLINTON....

hahahaahhh.... Great Freak Show... bizarre characters... this Carson guy... wow... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

As a black man, I didnt like Ben Carson before I got to know him and how he thinks, but now Im starting to like and agree with this guy. He is right on the money. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is going to go down. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its interesting how you media people are all collaborating to kill Carson! it proves what hes been saying all along about the media, you guys are out to get him! Americans should see through this! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump won again when has he ever lost at anything? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is full of crap. He used Politicos smear article regarding Carsons West Point comments against him. Why is Trump using fallacious attacks from the liberal media to use against a fellow republican? Is Trump against the liberal media or isnt he? The liberal media is the main enemy of conservatives. Why is he siding with them? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016 ...the only choice for America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
About time someone is setting the record straight on what everyone believes are lies! Go Carson! God is watching over you! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im glad that this facade has not broken Dr. Carson and his campaign <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Blacks or African Americans Democrats, not Republican if Obama the first African American president and follow by a Black President, Carson, a Republican then history kinda look weird because Democrat help Blacks and minorities and Republican favor Corporate America the left always want to rewrite history, they dont want Carson to be the next president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson was upfront and honest about it from the jump... If he wouldve failed to mention his violent past, headlines would read. BEN CARSON ATTACKED MOTHER WITH HAMMER AS A YOUTH or BEN CARSON TRIED TO STAB HIS COUSIN. either way he wouldve ran into this issue. The left media knows whatever they put out their mindless followers would believe. They made Obama out to be Jesus, and my coworkers referred to him as such. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson is a damn liar and a weirdo <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahaha everybody is a hypocrite except Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Are some Americans really impressed by the opinion of a dumb islam convert sport guy on this brilliant doctor? Will not believe that. If i were American i would definitely vote for Carson. More intelligent than Trump and more human than iron lady Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It seems like almost every republican up there with the exception of cruz, if they drop out, their votes go to Carson over Trump. Nice to see a sane response to the climate change problem for once. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is right. A Muslim always will try to change Americas God for a bloodthirsty Allah. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a nut. Vote Trump!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Interesting, so he tried to stab a relative hit his mother with a hammer, geesh Maybe he told those stories to show he was a troubled kid living in a bad neighborhood with no male role models but somehow turned his life around, wheres Olivia Pope from Scandal, Ben Carson needs help running his campaign especially after the Rap ad, lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for president 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson revival of religion in his life, you must confess to God and the people around him. The news will always be confused about this event. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
vote for Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Vote for Ben Carson. Yeah, just because you want to deny rights to gay people doesnt mean you hate them! You just dont think they should have equal rights because your idea of marriage doesnt line up with theirs? Like if you want to deny rights to pot smokers, it doesnt mean you hate them. You just hate what THEY DO but not THEM! I get you BEN! p <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BALANCED TICKET CARSON TRUMP 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What this is really about is that black liberals like Kareem cannot fathom a black conservative going against the predetermined liberal path democrats think all blacks have to follow. He made himself look like an idiot, bashing an extremely intelligent doctor and calling him terrible and then he says its just because he doesnt think he has experience. #Carson2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson saying who he tried to stab is like someone running for president telling everyone who he masturbated to as a teenager. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Awwww look at these poor presidential candidates getting difficult questions from a couple of reporters... I mean if Ben Carson is too weak to handle a few questions how do you think this lightweight will handle someone like Putin. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump makes some good points about foreign policy, but his attack on Ben Carson is not good for him. Mose evangelicals believe in redemption and that God can change people from bad to good. He needs to let go of his attacks on Ben Carson, and focus on the horrible Islamic Dictator Husein Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson will kill at these debates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wouldnt just stand there. Yes you would Carson just like how you just stood there when you were in a restaurant during a stick up. Not only did you not do anything, you pointed to the guy behind the counter and said I dont work here. You want him, not me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah, Im starting to like Carson quite a bit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
just because Dr. Carson spoke about not supporting a Muslim for president all em radicals all have started to come utta their hiding places. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is right main stream media is nonsense .... Instead of spreading truth and good information main stream media spreads trash and negative energy , extremely bias and one sided main stream media is a tool <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Its interesting to note that while Dr Ben Carson is a highly recognized neurosurgeon, and a creative genius among other things, he may very well have some serious mental disorders. No one has corroborated any of those stories he has been telling about being a badass youngster....and, if he is lying, why does he feel the need to create such lies????? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Media bias is NOT a badge of honor. It is one of greatest threats to our freedom. Control of the media is control of this country. We see this every day via the suppression and promotion of stories dependant on ones views. Carson knows this and is rightfully bringing it to light. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Every single one of Carsons stories about his past are outright, proven baldfaced lies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CARSONS CAMPAIGN HEAD IS WITH NATION OF ISLAM! HITING MOM ON HEAD WITH HAMMER, IS GENETIC, NORMAL KIDS NEVER HIT MOM ON HEAD WITH HAMMER TRYING TO KILL HER. IF HE WINS HE WILL HIT THE RED BUTTON WITH HAMMER LAUNCHING NUKES <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is total garbage. In Ben Carsons book One Nation there is literally a chapter title The Art of Compromise <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No Kareem the American people do not want another muslim president. However, Dr. Carson said he would support any person running for president, regardless of belief, as long as they follow the Constitution. Another biased, hypocrite, uneducated celebrity looking for fame. lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its awesome watching the foolish incompetent obviously dishonest media implode trying to paint a man like Carson as dishonest..

Kareem hate for Carson has NOTHING to do with what best for blacks. Kareem has been upset ever sense Carson said a Muslim should not be POTUS.Carson has done more to uplift and help the blacks than Kareem has ever even thought of doing. Kareem care about Muslims not the blacks in this countryHe such a loser he doesnt want to tell his real reason for attacking Carson as he knows no one will care, so being the liberal he is also, he plays the race card on Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not saying Im a Ben Carson fan. but what he said in my opinion wasnt controversal. I work security and in training classes. we talk about shootings and one of the things we talk about is fighting our way out. if u lock your self in a office space and lets say its u and a few other ppl and the killer is about to burst through the door. its smart to grab what ever is around u and you all attack the killer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the biggest boring sleepinducing fuck out there when he speaks. For someone who is supposedly intelligent, his invoking god and dismissing some of the established scientific facts makes him look retarded. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox, youre just as bad as MSNBC! Carson was accepted by a general, but not through the typical application process. How much oilwar money are you getting bribed to destroy the reputation of an honest man! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is awesome! Thank God for men like Dr Carson...faithful, extremely smart, honest, loves our Creator, calm and respectful, brave to stand for what he believes in, cared for children and saved many lives...We will continue to pray for you Dr. Carson.

Fox News corrupt bias. Trump is revered on Hannity. Then Carson is picked on. They are trying to destroy his campaign like the did with constant negativity with Bush. This was a distastful, anti GOP news. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson will be an amazing President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ill hand it to Ben Carson. Hes ambitious, but hes barking up the wrong tree here. Negotiating on a friggin school board will not educate one black child. Black rappers and singers are the best musicians in the world. Hes taking a page from Barack Obamas book, but it wont work, because hes Republican. I think he should just ignore black people from now on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love you Dr. Carson. Keep on being amazing!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is a psycopath <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This country is going to need someone with the ability to think and solve some very big problems this country is facing. The country doesnt need another politician who just tries to get everyones emotions whipped up. Too many times emotions lead to bad decisions. Careful thought and reason lead to the best decisions.Ben Carson is a brilliant, thinking man.He will use careful thought to do what is best for the country and everyone in it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does anyone realize that Fox is 100% lies? Every single thing that has said about Carson is TRUE and is said BY CARSON HIMSELF. WHY IS THE SCHOLARSHIP STORY NOT TRUE? WESTMORELAND WAS NOT THERE YOU LIARS! IT IS IN THE BOOK!!!! I will NEVER EVER trust one word out of Fox. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love how meek he is, intelligent, and detailed, quickly. No political answerdance around the question. Just straight forward honesty <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is simply just trying to make Ben Carson look bad. He is trying to just make Ben look bad to make in order to make himself seem like a better person. He is just judging him off a pat experience that happened before he was a teenager. People can mature and change their ways. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Thats pretty obvious! Ben Carson gives God credit for his success while with Donald Trump, its all about me! Narcissistic! Trump claims to be a Christian but as he would say, I really dont know.

This isnt Carsons full immigration plan. He wants to put Military, Border agents etc.. on the border. Also he said Immigrants need to pay all back taxes, sign up as guest workers, if they have broken the law, other than being here, they wouldnt be eligible to stay. They would not be elgible for any welfare programs. Thats the main part I can remember. It is not feasible or legal to ship 11 million immigrants out of here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Theres absolutely no way Id trust Carson after he lied about his background and experience growing up. The last Republican President that lied got us into two wars and caused our economy to meltdown. Thanks but no thanks on Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fuck obama, fuck carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson wrote and spoke about his testimony decades before he had ever thought about running for president or wrote a book about it. He was already a wealthy physician and had nothing to gain by his testimony which has not changed in over 40 years. This is already starting to backfire on the media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson also claims to have been abducted by aliens and says he had his asshole rammed by an alien with a 15 inch ALIEN COCK. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Carson, you will answer for comparing scrutiny with My President Obama and because I know you Dr. Carson hate it, My Commander In Chief, with a Law Degree in Const. Law.. Eight Years as the Leader of the free World. Nobel Peace Prize. May he want to on the highest court in the land. Dr. Carson I wouldnt let you cut my steak. Run my Country I rather jump off the near by Golden Gate Bridge. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Apparently Ben Carson does not only suffer from a god delusion, but also from experiential falsehoods. Claims he made about himself are not correct. He will not be my doctor, nor my president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Get ready folks. Half of the debate is going to be wasted discussing what Carson did or didnt do when he was 14 years old. The other half is going to be wasted discussing Rubios credit cards. Its going to be a bigger waste of time than the CNN debate. The kiddy table debate will no doubt be much more informative. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well Mr. Starnes, you can claim the media is lynching Carson all you want, but facts pesky things that they are are facts......and the facts are Carson has not only embellished his personal history, he out and out lied about it as well. He has made claims that have been easily challenged and refuted, by many of the people involved. Sorry Todd, but this is one time where, like it or not, the fault lies with one person Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I disagree with Ben Carsons views on Planned Parenthood. I think that while there were some problems with the original founder Margaret Sanger, but it has evolved into a respectable institution, because obviously Sanger isnt involved anymore. That being said, Ben Carson is a fine candidate, and has his head firmly on his shoulders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Why did Ben Carson hit his mother in the head with a hammer. I will never vote for a man who hit his mother with a hammer. Ben Carson is really crazy. Did he hit his mother in the head to see what inside of her head. I hoped his mother had her wig on when he hit her in the head. I hope his mother had Obamacare when he hit her in the head. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is not only a liar but he is is an exceedingly bad liar... The media didnt lynch Carson, he hung himself telling multiple lies trying to cover other silly lies . On the other hand it is no small wonder he gets away in doing so among the people that also believe woman was made from the rib of a man and was talked into eating a magic apple by a talking snake . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I cant understand how they dont get why the media is lynching Carson, but didnt do the same with Obama. Obama wasnt using his background to gain support, Carson on the other hand is using his story to win over the massive evangelical demographic. I dont blame him though, give those suckers a I don came to Jesus story and tell them he agrees with theyre crazy, and they will eat out of the palm of his hands <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
With all due respect Carson would be a pretty good vice president at best <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a good man and the liberal media should die from shame for attacking him this way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

why is fox talking about carson like he has any credibility,i can not get by the pyramids ,let alone the west point bs. yet fox talks like he is just another presidential candidate,like he did not lie ,he is a cadet for sure a space cadet. RUN DON RUN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Is Carson a witch doctor? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson lied about the incident that lead to his claimed faith after people from his childhood were asked about this temper he had and the attempted stabbing and attacks and of course none of this happened and he was actually some softly spoken pocket protector nerd. And the whole reason hes claiming this is taking advantage of religious people by playing on your emotions when hes actually a sociopath. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Politico I figured out your mistake in about 15 min, and Im no journalist. Trump jumped on your error by opening his big mouth about Carson lying, so that makes for 2 amateur remarks Friday. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny how they are trying to pin lies in Carson. Obama been lying to us since 2008. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why would ben carson admit to stabbing someone? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like ben carson,just wish the media would of spent a little more time vetting that thing people call a president of some country i dont even know anymore <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The best fact is Ben Carson is a noble man and they cant find anything to prove him dishonest so they are using these past stories he had told in the media about himself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
George Will now fighting one of the radical right monsters he helped create. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is rite on all points and levels. We need a good leader like him to pull us all together and only then we can do great things as a nation. We as a people need to leave a legacy for future generations to follow. We owe that to our children and to those who inherit this country after we die. This should be every Americans obligation. Our obligation should not be how much of a hand out can I get from the government. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I admire Carsons truthfulness. He is is a standup guy .. I respect him .. everyone makes mistakes. . Obama should be in prison for his actions his and past. If not president ,I would like to see Carson as vice president. . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont understand this man.. Guest worker!!!?! Seal the borders!?! Like really please that is not goin to stop any immigrants from Latin America, Asia, Africa, etc.. And as you mr Carson as a minority should not think of doing these things to that extent <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Congratulations Dr. Carson on your hand installment by God. They worked their magic I am sure. When is God going to install the rest so that you can become our next President? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I like Carson, but clearly hes a bit of a nut and does not have the required experience to be president.... would much prefer TRUMP negotiating deals with China. TRUMP 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ben Carson and will vote for him in 2016. Im hoping that he gets in because he is wiser and not a hot head like Trump. Hillary proved what she would do when Americans die overseas. We want her for president she doesnt reflect the views of any party but herself and doesnt seem to be authentic like Mr Carson. I think he would agree that Putin shouldnt be the only one setting the pace for Syria . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016! Carson for VP! it cant be stopped. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For those who believes in God, yes, God sent Trump and told him to service the people and country. Be noticeable and outspoken. For those who believed in evolution, how we evolved and acquired class and quality, we got Donald Trump always two steps ahead. For any reason VOTE FOR TRUMP 2016 !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump, Bill, Carson...... I legit hate them all. Idk why Im watching this because my head is exploding. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump, stopping people coming to USA does not make you a great nation as you will have human resource and diverse idea calamities. USA problem right now is you have very less people than China and you need more people to use the resources you have. What will you do with all the empty and barrain lands without using the immigranta Mr. So called businessman? How will you improve the economy for 21st century ? Ben Carson is way better on imigration and foreign policies. Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BERNIE SANDERS. BERNIE SANDERS. NON RELIGIOUS,. WANTS THE BEST FOR AMERICA. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I just really cant see and do not want to see Carson leading our country. You need more than a smile and calm demeanor to be a good president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, just Wow at the comments. Sad, not just here but everywhere. Go support your candidate, if you are not considering Dr. Carson why are you drawn to him? A homing device you have yet to figure out. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carsons story about his Perceptions 301 psychology course are the latest not to check out. Yale University says they did not offer any class by that name or number. I dont know if Carson has a problem telling the truth, or if he just lives in a fantasy world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great man Carson, hes one honest , god loving man and the media is basis . I believe Carson over the media and we all know the media is liberal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does Carson forget that minorities werent even people according the constitution when it was created. The founding fathers did not think far ahead. Guy is delusional if he thinks those men had any idea. Ill grant that they had some, but hes giving them way more credit than they deserve. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I hope Carson Runs....I would vote for him.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look Carson in the eyes and its painfully evident that hes a crazy mofo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The more people like Carson and OReilly speak, the more they damage the Republican party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson was a nerd at school. This violent past never existed, its a fiction. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump was awesome.. and very classy to not touch on the Ben carson thing about him acting like a Bully kid when he was young. hurting someone with a hammer?? ugh... how does that help ?..shaking my head!! .. that was just to stupied anyway Very wierd.. GOOD JOB Trump.. and very FUNNY Show..We all enjoyed it.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So he attacks his mother with a hammer and tried to stab a relative.... No normal human being does this.. He also denies the Theory of Evolution... Yeah, hes retarded.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He has this storyabout the stabbing in order to glorify God. Most people glorify themselves. Hes glorifying God and hes not backing down. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson didnt accuse PoliticoCNN of lying. He just stated the facts. Ben was violent, briefly in his life, He prayed about it, and God changed him forever. Gifted Hands 1990. CNN knows Ben has a brother, they should have asked him, not 9 random people in detroit, who probably didnt know Ben that well 50 years ago <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lol Trumps comment at Ben Carson trying to prove that he stubbed someone <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does Ben Carson think everyone is an idiot ?You fucking liar, General Westmoreland never told you to seek a scholarship, this never happened. You get an appointment through your elected politician. In no way would a graduate of a US military academy ever have spoken in such a manner. I have zero respect for General Westmorelands competence or leadership. But Ben Carson made no mistake here, he lied period. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love what they said about him on ABC said about him. They said that this story about stabbing actually glorifies God not Ben Carson because God saved him. I hope the media keeps asking about this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think we should believe Carson when he says they are lying. After all he is one of the worlds foremost liars so he would know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trump is a POS!! hes a racist and hates latinos...How many non whites does he have in his upper ranks???? none... Cant vote for a racist!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bill Clinton I did not have sex with that woman. Ben Carson I did try to kill most of my family and friends. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Being great at cutting into people does not necessarily make you an authority on other subjects. Ben Carson is the living proof. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson QUACK!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson isnt given enough credit! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont see the point of finding more answers to Ben Carsons acts in the past. Its obviously clear. What more do they want? A tootsie pop? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an Uncle Tom <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is antifact. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Again, no admission from the media that they failed to to VET Obama. Where is the response to Carsons critique of the medias vetting of Obama? This nothing less than tacit admission that they did not treat Obama to the same scrutiny. In fact most media will not even repeat Carsons specifics charges of media bis regarding Obama that he made on CNN a day ago. It speaks for itself the Media are largely conducting a witch hunt. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON CARSON CARSON <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
First thing Carson does before answering a question is go to sleep.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson says he wouldnt do Saturday night live but comes our with a rap song. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wish i was a US citizen to vote for Trump big time!!! Carson employed a nurse hahahahahaha <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont you find it crazy that Carson is saying he was doing bad things and the media are saying no you did not. Its oposite to normal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Give me a Carson Cruz or a Cruz Carson ticket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON DOESNT WANT TO GO ON SNL BECAUSE HE TAKES HIS JOB SERIOUSLY. ITS NOT A JOKE. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OMG I BUST out laughing at that last part when carson closed his eyes and said this girl had dismenated meduloblastoma.... I bet that never happened. lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trump makes alot of sense. Ben carson is just weird. Ben has a wild imagination and is a weirdo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Caron will not be president so this is all a waste. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great Q A @Fox w @realDonaldTrump on Carson, Keystone, ISIS, pot <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a delusional theocrat nutjob who should not be allowed anywhere near the presidency. GOP Waaaahhhh, stop asking us tough questions!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No challenge to Clinton lies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wheres Ben Carsons birth certificate??? Why wont he just come out and show up in what country he was born? What do you have to hide, Benny? What an idiot. Show us your BIRTH CERTIFICATE, Benny! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
thats for ppl the keep saying the Trump is on full attack mode on Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump that was honorable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump was great last night lol...Liberals were crying soo hard and i always knew those were trumps stand points on marijuana..a very logical and good stand to take let states decide for recreational and back medical fully <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah, that was a little confusing. I like Ben Carson, think that the attacks on him are generally lame, but also think he could have done better here. If you want to see something great from him, watch the recent press conference where he takes on the media. It was great. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Leave Ben Carson alone, the first real black president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what is this , ask carson if he knows how to be a president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey Bosse Grytbakk, How much is the Carson campaign paying you troll Carson vids on youtube? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh my, a lot of democratic idiots that bash on every person who supports Ben Carson. Give me a break. Get off the channel if you hate this so much. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They should really sound a bell or some alarm to wake people up every time a carson clip has been shown on programs. You keep on rewinding and slumbering into the same pitfall. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a walking contradiction ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sorry Jeb ... I take a large part of the blame for the Governments gridlock. I voted for them to go on strike, and I voted for the Stay Puff family to go on vacation a lot. My Vote! counts. Maybe someday youll understand why America needed to be immobile for awhile. A hint I found a dinothor on the lose trying to grab the reins of the Chariot. So I used the Chariot to make snow donuts as fast as I could. You, Carson, and Trump have my Vote! for POTUS, VP, and Financial Chief. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great way to deflect from what is really going on. Dr. Carson is raising on the polls and its driving liberals and Trump crazy. Listen, if the only thing they can find about Dr. Carson is something he saiddid 50 years ago. Its sad. Dont let the media get to you Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson is a fucking idiot <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This controversy concerning Dr. Ben Carson is a fiction. It is an invention by people who have total contempt for the intellectual capacity of WE THE PEOPLE. I have news for these bottomfeeding, scumsucking vermin. WE THE PEOPLE are not buying your bullshit. It is you, CNN, Fox, Politico, NBC, ABC, CBS, MSNBC, etc., that have our utter and complete contempt. We will make up our own minds and not be manipulated by your obvious sophistry. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If the Republicans vote for Ben Carson, then theyre just wasting their time. He will not get the black votes, and at best we see him as a coon. I speak for the majority. The best bet is to vote for Donald Trump. Hes the only person on the Republican side that I can even imagine black people will vote for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, I am also concerned that such a religious nut as Carson becoming president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hang in there Dr. Carson. Because of what the media is doing, Christians all over America will vote for you to show their support. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is such an Uncle Tom <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is such a non issue. These people are stupid. Ben Carson said it right and they are just are a bunch of racists. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

aww can Carson not handle the press? Youre running for President ya twat <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson speaks like an idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is HitlerysKillerys greatest threat, so the LIBERTARD media are on board, trying to take Dr. Carson down. Thats PATHETIC. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is a buffoon. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a sociopath. He lies about everything. He is terrible. Really <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How stupid, the media misinterprets a statement made by Carson, and instead of apologizing for their mistake, go on to say that Carson lied! Hey Fox News! why dont read what Dr. Carson actually stated he was informally offered a scholarship to West Point. The guy is brilliant and a Christian, dont accuse the guy of lying. Only ones who do that are the media and politicians. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is an impostor. Here is a man who worships money. The thing you worship becomes your God and when your God is money you are easily controlled. Pride goes before destruction, And a haughty spirit before stumbling.proverbs 1618 If you think Trump is anything other then a narcissist you are asleep. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is done! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a bitch! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Trump is onto something. Carson does look like hes on psychotropic prescription drugs. If he stops using will Mr. Hyde come out? For Petes sake. Hitting someone in the face with a lock. Stabbing a friend in the abdomen with a knife. Attempting to hit is mother with a hammer. Is that presidential material? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben has gone allpsycho on America! All of his recent fame from being up in a couple of meaningless polls was too much to handle. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
At least Carson had the brains to call it his theory. Bill states his own theory as if it were an indisputable fact. How does he know? Did a pharoah tell him personally? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i was going to vote for trump but after learning more about carson and eveything hes about there is a good chance i will vote for him i like the fact that hes a christian and i like what hes about and what he stands for. if hilary gets into office we are all fucked shes nothing but a snake <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox and the rest of the media reported this as a fact, solely based on Politicos claims...........which they now admit were false. Fox, and the other media outlets all owe Carson a public apology for false and irresponsible reporting......and in Politicos case, straight up intentional lies. This could easily be a lawsuit right here. Being that this is a fraudulant story that Fox is just as guilty of the others as spreading, Fox should remove this video and apologize. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, the Nonfactor is pretty pathetic. Not surprised to see that this fool is repeating discredited left wing talking points. Politico had to TWICE revise their article about Dr. Carson. Both the Nytimes and Washington Post have called the politico article out as being a sham. Shame on you, Bill OReily. So much for wanting to help the folks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I may not agree with Ben Carson but I respect him because he says what he wants. If you are not liberal and are black, you are in dnager. You have to agree with everything they say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Ben Carson cant even get a close relative to back him up, how is he gonna run the country?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Media trying to kill Carson because he is trumps competition and trump wants to have sex woth his daughter, but no big deal right trump supporters? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everybody knows that Dr. Ben Carson is telling the truth about west point and the left wing media is throwing everything at the wall and seeing what stick when it comes to Dr. Ben Carson. There for Dr. Ben Carson raise 3,500,000 dollars to his campaign this week and added 100,000 new facebook friends so the left wing media lies helped Dr. Ben Carson lol #BC2DC16. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson is a liar he cast and make up stories and made money on his book and packing with the super pacs, today I watch Ben being attacked from 15 direction from the medias If you look closely of carson he couldnt handle it This is not great leadership! No way Unacceptable I was with carson now Im with Trump..TRUMP2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Little known fact the ghost writer of Ben Carsons book also authored A Million Little Pieces <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fox is Cnn trying to smear you ? Carson They are daring to suggest that I am good person who have overcome difficulties, I am a violent man who hits my mother with a hammer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is coming UNGLU ED. You cannot win by trying to complain that someone else needs more scrutiny. What happened to Carsons Calm, Cool, UNSHAKABLE demeanor? Carson knows that HE is the one who lied and you can bet that the media smells blood in the water...and its because CARSON shot himself in the foot with his wild claims <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even Papa Douche cant polish this ridiculously smelly turd with a straight face. Sorry Carson, being a pathological liar just is not going to work in the twenty first century. It is just too easy to find out the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson needs to say this for street credibility. He aint no slim jesus. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is the antichrist <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson though he is a wise man, he might not win because America will be destroyed some day. except they weep and humble themselves before God <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson all the way! Dont let the get you brother!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
either trump or carson is going to get the nomination. I have a feeling it is going to be ben <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Ben Carson feels frustrated by the media, it is important to note that HE VOLENTEERED THIS INFORMATION, and for what reason I do not know why but this is journalism 101 to get to the bottom of these stories THAT HE VOLENTARLY shared. Personally I think its kind of creepy that a person of his somnambulant demeaner could utter those stories, is he telling the media that he would cut a bitch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
one Question Dr.Carson As a surgeon can Megyn nose situation be fixed ore its too late and we have suffer looking at it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Notice how the CNN lady said she assumed this and thought that. Well, those arent facts lady and you cannot present them as such, that is slander and illegal for the press though its not like your org has a history of extreme violence and misrepresentations of facts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

General Westmoreland could not have met with Ben Carson on memorial day 1969 because he was never in Detroit on that day. It simply never happened. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
not a fan of both so called conservatives Michael Savage was right about the Leprechaun aka OReilly...always want to write a book for the Will is another clown who didnt support Reagan in 1980 in the primaries because he thought Reagan was too extreme <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Funny how its easy to prove a point when there is no one to argue with. But when you confront the person head own, you get owned. Carson owned every bold face lie he has been confronted with. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
While Ben Carson is hunted by the media because some little imprecisions, Obama e Clinton are telling the worlds biggest lies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You guys are supposed to be so smart.....how come everybody is ignoring that Dr. Carson is mentioning himself as an example ?????!!!!!!!!! You didnt try to hit your mother in the head......but I think you are a dangerous man Donald and I am scared of your big mouth negotiating with our enemies......I wouldnt be scared of Dr.Carsons ability to do anything at all.....CARSON CARSON CARSON <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trumps comments on Carsons only way of recovery is by taking pills purely proves that Donald is non religious and has no faith in Christ like he claims he does. Because anyone of faith knows that one can be healed or change their ways in life through faith alone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I laughed through the entire video but not at Carson but at what constitutes as new god Fox, CNN, huffpost and others are stupid Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I feel like watching Fox News and listening to conservatives speak makes my IQ plummet. I dont understand Dr. Ben Carsons stupidity being a renowned neurosurgeon, and what hes doing is not an act he said a lot of dumb things even before he had a political agenda. He just poorly deflected the medias valid questions here and this panel excused him for it. I dont get why Fox is ashamed of openly aknowledging that they lean right, even denying it at times. Its so obvious. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh, and yeah, its ok to dig at Carson, but nobody ever asked the pertinent hard questions of obama when he was running! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I really think Carson made a bad move releasing that book at this time, he could have waited to release it till after GOP nomination cause he had to know the media would tear it shitless...and trump handles the media better then that..he takes the media by its balls and steers it around <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
George Will is a liberal pretending to be a conservative, and that is why silly liberals come running when he gets dismantled with facts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

mr Carson acts like a doctor and America needs a Sheriff... no beter Shariff like mr Trump wrong or right <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is painfully stupid. He thinks that the pyramids were built by Joseph of Nazareth, Jesuss stepdad, to store grain. He also believes being gay is a choice. You couldnt pay me to touch another dude. Much less sleep with, kiss, raise a family, and spend the rest of my life, in gay love, by choice. Its not a choice for me. Is it for you? If NO. What makes anyone think its a choice for someone else? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why are politicians afraid to answers direct questions? This happens on almost every interview with running candidates. Ben Carson is just another example of people I dont trust. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He looks unstable <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson and Trump but man Trump ,dont get caught up in the stupid name calling the media wants you guys to do obviously. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
anybody notice how Faux News ended that segment of a distorted face of Ben Carson? Its this passive aggressive pro establishment Republican slant that led me away from watching this fake news channel years ago <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a WHITE MAN in a BLACK MANs body <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am not clear on his policies at all. Its like he is pontificating on his success in life, but doesnt really have any clear views on TRADE POLICY WHICH has killed America BTW . I dont care about his success in life and how his mother worked so hard, not everybody has the aptitude to be a neurosurgeon. I see a nice guy who has an empty message of HOPE in CARSON. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders Gets The Highest Marks For Honesty And Integrity. Ben Carson Is Second, But Thats In The Stupid And Crazy Category. Silly Fox News. Always Getting It Wrong. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This is why the Right is such an utter joke. Allowing disgusting frauds like Carson into the race. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Ben Carson, he is a great man Im disgusted by the bios the media is showing against him. Its interesting that liberals say they are against racism, but many of the attacks on Carson are racist themselves. This is very hypocritical. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Glad at least someone sees through Carsons BS. I have no idea why he gets so much favorability rankings from republicans. Dude came out in support of the TPP yesterday, which is bigger than the West Point thing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a sociopath who southern hicks are flocking to because they view him as a reformed black man and one of the good ones. It reinforces the notion that black men are inherently violent and the only way they can better themselves is through Jesus and hard work. Donald Trump is the only man who can save America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
another rebel, kind of like Sarah Palin only smarter, more cunning, but just as stupid what Carson says is for effect, to get attention just another ineffective rich guy who thinks he has answers when he doesnt <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When obama was running for pres.....Hope and Change....First black president...hes not a muslim, hes a Christian.

BILL GOT HIS ASS STOMPED!!! Good for George Will for calling him out on his lame ass journalism. No big fan of George will but LOVE THE GIPPER. Every word pertaining to Reagans health WAS retracted, not from any so called pressure but those men found out later what they heard was third hand gossip and based on nothing.oreilly put it in his book anyway. I THINK BILL CALLS THIS PERNICIOUS. EAT SHIT REILLY <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is right again...The whole media is saying we cant find all the people you tried to kill Carson, and Ben is angry because they dont believe he used to be a violent kid. Pretty crazy when you think about it ...Thats the last thing you want to talk about when youre running for president you would think. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What youre not going to find with me is someone who will sit back and let you be completely unfair without letting the American people know whats going on Dr. Ben Carson, Go ahead President Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Another lying ass NIer wearing a fancy suit and you folks are just itching to put his butt in the White House. Okay so hes a Doctor. What the FUK does that have to do with being President of the United States ? But you guys just eat it up with a spoon. People usually deserve the leaders they follow.

OReilly doesnt write books. Killing this, killing that, killing everything. What? 4,5, 6 of them within a year or so? This puke has a huge team of writers doing the leg work. He hasnt written a single one of them. Just slaps his name on RINO paper trash. The RINOS hated Reagan. And Billy is just that, a puppet of the RINO class of Bush Co. FUCK YOU OReilly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OReilly is a joke, Go Dr. Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fuck you Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OLieRey, YOU are the one who has let your viewers down. Youre just like the other media hacks. Youre salivating at the prospect that you can catch Dr. Carson on some impropriety, some lie, some weakness. Some of your colleagues want it so bad, they cant help but to invent it out of whole cloth. Im sure in their warped, convoluted, egocentric mediaminds, they believe theyre telling the truth. You people wouldnt know the truth if it broke your nose. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson have everyone talking for him and Mr. Trump has none it is because Trump doesnt listen to people when they talk and draw quick conclusions and patters even before atempt to understand the questions. How can people want someone like Trump to become the president of America to make many decisions on behalf of people when does not even listen to one individual. This is a simple fact. Listen more and talk less. Thats why the polls are going down for Trump ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the media is not distorting anything, Ben Carson brought this upon himself. you make judgment if lying matters presidential integrity. yet there hasnt been a president who did not lie. except G.washington <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont care. Still like Carson. Trump is very smart. I agree let Russia blow them up for us. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben, sleepy, Carson is totally finished. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
especially if theyre republican? Thats because republicans are known for saying dumb stupid shit all the time not because theyre targeted. If you dont want to be a target of the press DONT SAY STUPID THINGS. As easy as that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben Carson is only one out of three candidates in both parties that objectively makes sense. Carly Fiorina makes some good points, but rand Paul and Ben Carson are literally the only real people and the rest of the democrats and republicans are talking heads and sideshow freaks with no connection whatsoever to reality. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Trump Carson and Ted Cruz. Now if these three would be running the US....? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It disgusts me that The View can get away for this. Comments on anyones looks, from your hair to your face, should be left to political comics, not to actual discussions. Especially when our country is so fundamentally split on real issues like abortion, immigration, and other things it pains me to see people from either party have to take time out of their campaign to defend against smiling as a joke to lighten the mood at a debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is in Obamas face and got audited by Obamas thug IRS, and doesnt back down. I think Carson is a pure blooded American. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bullcrap Fox news.. Everyone needs to listen to his press conference... The Media twisted this... Semantics... Dr. Carson did nothing wrong.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I can hardly believe my ears... Fox news people, Wallace and Smith saying Ben Carson claimed he was admitted to West Point... but Ive read passages from his book, and watched multiple past interviews and he always claimed the same thing, I was OFFERED a full scholarship. SHAME ON YOU FOX NEWS!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is he high? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEING A POLITICIAN AND LEARNING TO BE A DOCTOR NOW THAT I FIND DIFFICULT. BEN CARSON WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He never wrote in his book that he sought admission. In some of West Points own literature, the word scholarship has been used. Here is an article detailing why the Politico article was a gross mischaracterization. bencarsondidntlieaboutwestpointitsbenshapiro <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Unbelievable. A person who has come up the hard way, is a good man, who has never had a divorce yet, who is an accomplished neurosurgeon, who actually saved peoples lives I dont want comparisons with the military here, who do a great job themselves has to explain so much about himself, more so than any other candidate. Even a booha character like Donald Trump he judges bikini clad women in his free time doesnt get scrutinized this much. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump fears Carson, thats why he is so persistent trying to make him look bad. In my opinion that only makes Trump look worse. What do you guys think? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
O Reilly should have done his homework on ths one. Ben Carson was grossly mischaracterized regarding West Point. bencarsondidntlieaboutwestpointitsbenshapiro <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
First of all, OReilly is a joke. Secondly, this attack on Carson is because he didnt agree with CNBCs kindergarten politics during the debates. This is for sure a smear campaign. Doesnt matter, Carson is still a looney toon, but our media seems like its ran by angry children. Grow the fuck up mass media, grow the fuck up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So... hes not just a complete lunatic, hes also a complete liar. No West Point acceptance, no violent past, no restaurant robbery... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is trash and a traitor. He was a friend with him last week talking nice things about him and now he want to you use these lies to destroy him. This is only going to help Carson . Dr. Carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

1 THE WEST POINT STORY IS JUST A CONFUSION OVER THE WORD SCHOLARSHIP, VS APPOINTMENT. BIG DEAL ! 2 PEOPLE USUALLY LIE TO COVER UP THEIR MISTAKES. DR CARSON IS IN TROUBLE FOR TELLING THE TRUTH ?? 3 FAITH IN GOD CAN WORK MIRACLES, AND CHANGE PEOPLE. JESUS CAME TO DELIVER US FROM OUR BONDAGES TO SIN ... INCLUDING ANGER EPISODES ! AND APPARENTLY DR CARSON IS A LIVING EXAMPLE OF GODS REDEMPTIVE WORK IN HIS LIFE. THANK GOD ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Actually, the step pyramid at Saqqara WAS used as a grain silo under the rulership of Netjerikhet Djoser. This was during a seven year period of famine. hmm, where have we heard that before... Check out the famine stela for verification. The Egyptians didnt start using pyramids as burial tombs until the first intermediate period. How about you pseudojournalists actually do some real research before you rip apart Ben Carson. SMH <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson confesses his failings as a young person, and why is this wrong? People cant make up their minds. They dont like him because he supposedly was less than honest about Westpoint emphasis on supposedly. They dont like him because of his honesty about his flaws. This is nuts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Seriously, whats with the farting noises at 526? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I totally understand Ben Carson. God changed my life. I know what it feels to be transformed by his power. No matter if it is in the bathroom, church, street. God is everywhere and is willing to save us from sin if we give our lives to Him. God bless America, but America needs to bless God too. We need to go back to Him.

400 people poll and thats that? The poll is nonsense I would guarantee its been manipulated by the GOP to push carson up because the want him to get the nomination because hes easily bought. Carson will never beat hillary in a million years. Trump is the only chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not since the reign of Caligula had somebody in politics had to publicly refute claims that he DIDNT stab a friend or attack his mother. Carson is fucking nuts, and thats just plain ol COMMON SENSE. Surely you poor souls still desperately defending him who buy into common sense could already start to see that. Ben Carson has no place in a public spotlight. He doesnt know how to lead a nation he cant even place a value on what a nation actually is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I have to be honest, even I think this is minor. I dont like carson, but if he is too be taken down, Id rather it be on ideas and policy of which there is a lot to debate, or is there? and not some nonsense from way back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson never lied. This is the left winged idea. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sort of like Jesus and the parable of feeding the poor but instead feeding education. The Democrats want to give the uneducated a fish each day and expect them to stand in line tomorrow for another.

Is the media really that dumb. Look, if a General tells you that you have a full ride if you want it, then thats how it is. Period. Stop trying to find something on Carson.

WE THE PEOPLE have had enough! The heads of all you media types are going to be exploding after President Benjamin Carson wins in a landslide! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How about if Fox does a comparison between Hillary, Obama and Carson and see who comes out on top as THE MOST DISHONEST. I mean really, one story from Ben Carsons old book compared to all of the lies and inconsistencies of the other two? We have a selfadmitted MUSLIM in the White House who incessantly lies about being a Muslim but Fox cant bring that to light? This is just crazy. Fox are you all headed to the left now or what? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Well what a coincedence! As soon as Ben Carson takes the lead and goes after the Media, they go on the war path. It was expected and I am not surprised. Many of us old enough to remember what happened to Ross Perot know what is going on here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Disgraceful man tried ti kill people? Who would vote for this nut? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is lying. I want to see police reports because if he was violent their would be a police report at some point. Then when people get into fights trust me someone would have seen it and it word travels fast when something like the things he is saying happen. I am sorry this guy is trying to be Judge Mathis. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am undecided still, but Ben Carson is a brilliant, good hearted man IMHO <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like this guy more now <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Still looking for a mentally sane Republican candidate for presidency ? Somehow i think we need to understand that such a thing does not exist anymore <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson talks faith to the point of Lunacy. he says the pyramids were built as graneries. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media is really exposing themselves now... But thank you Kelly for being one of the honest and fair ones. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A likable guy, even if he is crazy as a nut... Pyramids grain silos? WTF? How much grain fits into Khufus? Even if its big, its got small cramped rooms dr! Maybe I like him because hes not A4 p <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a total wacko! Ben Carson is so pathetic its not even funny. The entire Presidential candidates are bunch of clowns. This country is going down the toilet and it truly saddens me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is such a great mana very smart, articulate gentleman and I hope he can be elected our next President. The lefty media will try to make him look bad at each word, so I hope he can rise above the TV, Internet and radio frenzy and Trump mud slinging circus with common sense and reasoning. The Demos have an axe to grind with a self made American success that just happens to be Black. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The Democratic partyrun media are really driving strong to the hoop on Carson now arent they. The command must have come down from aboveHilary, Obama, or Reid. Theyre resolved to destroy a black candidate that lifted himself up from the ghetto. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Its hilarious you have a candidate up here vehemently defending the fact that he tried to stab a close relative and attacked his own mother with a hammer. Youd think he want to keep to himself, but no thats something he seems to want to run on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is great. Maybe as a VP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My goodness, and this crazy person is leading the GOP race? That is just crazy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson makes a dunce of himself with every statement. He claimed that being gay is a choice because men change their sexual orientation in prison, that the earth was created in six days and that the Egyptian pyramids were built by Joseph of the bible as grain silos, not tombs, and that archaeologists think that aliens built them. Meet your GOP frontrunner, America! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson??? Nice guy, but his demasculinated tone may come from a lack of red meat in his diet. His Seventh Day Adventist church teaches that eating meat is a sin. Carsons prophetess Ellen G. White wrote that anyone who has meat in their belly at the resurrection cannot be translated into heaven Carsons S.D.A. church also does prophecy seminars explaining how Jesus lives in a giant spacecity located on Orions Belt. Sound a little whacky??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Solid, honest man. Just what are country needs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

How the hell is Kasich still on there. Some of these candidates need to get the hell out. What a waste of time. Bush, Paul, Cruz and Kasich should just bail out so we can have a more worthwhile debate among those who actually have a chance. Carson, by the way, is a joke. He thinks evolution was created by Satan and that the Earth was literally created in 6 days. He represents the dumb of America. There is no way hell be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Let me just say any canidate that does not support medicalrecreational marijuana or just support the states right to decide will not have a shot at being nominated or being president...its not my opinion its just how things are its like a force of nature it cant be stopped <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
White people like this man because he only casts blame on black people, never on racism as a systematic part of society. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has class. Oreilly could take some lessons. Trump is a bully.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is correct. Read The Rights of Colonists I. Paragraph 6 by Samual Adams <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is so stupid he thinks Jesuss Father Joseph built the pyramids to store grain in. First of all there is only one small room in the giant pyramid. Why on earth would he say something so stupid. He also says some scientists say aliens might have built them. Well there is not one real scientist on earth that says that. There are UFO enthusiasts that have said that but not scientists. If I needed brain surgery I would rather have Herman Cain do it on me that Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is for Mandatory Vaccinations <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am Polish American. I will say dr. Carson has no idea what he is talking about. Only Donald Trump knows how to do internationals deals and communicate with current world leaders. Marco Rubio is a kid. Bush is low energy person. H. Clinton has no idea as dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im still waiting for Ben Carson to offer one rational, practical, intelligent idea for dealing with the real needs and problems of this country and the world. Its going to be a long wait all he offers is religious dogma and mumbojumbo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson blinks so much. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Every time I hear been Carson talk I need a cup of coffee! He puts me to sleep! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If Carson wins he will be the first black president as Obama is no more black then he is white. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck trump. Bitch ass born rich pig. Rubio and carson came from nothing and are self made men.trump probably never learned how to tie his own shoe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson tried to kill doe one with a knife as a kid <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont know what to think about Carson. He seems a little sketchy at times. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If trump were a neurosurgeon all he would know is lobotomy Carson is better in that respect. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have no idea how Carson is even getting close to trump...rigged polls on his part?...and trump is not being mean he just is telling the truth and its hard for people to hear so they cry he is a meanie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is so fucking slow <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think they needed to give the middle guy more time to speak... I am a carson voter, but this interview felt pretty skewed... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson beating Trump by 0.2% on average. This video made it seem like it was a YUGE difference. Maybe 0.2% is also within the margin of error? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have been trying to identify practical, intelligent ideas that Ben Carson has proffered for dealing with the problems facing the country and the world, and I have found none. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson will bring good old fashion common sense into the WHite House and Congress. COmmon Sense seems to be missing and is badly needed especially with the huge National DeBt. I have written to my Congressman suggesting they form a Special NAtional Debt Committee that will monitor all other Committees presenting new bills andor Acts with a Mission Statement that they reverse the direction of the growing National Debt. Hope Dr. Ben Carson makes it all the way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The more one listens to Ben Carsons quiet, thoughtful comments, the more one realizes that he has nothing intelligent to say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson can carry trumps golf bag <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson is a fool thats at 22% has never gone over that.. fucking MEDIA u lil COCKSUCKERS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hmm, whose side should we take? An intelligent, educated, and highly articulated man like Dr. Ben Carson? Or, a supposedly educated professor who would resort to this bigoted rhetoric against him simply because she disagrees? Easy! BEN CARSON 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You know the main reason liberals dont like conservatism is because they believe that they always force their views on others, so in return the liberals try to force their views on the conservatives! What I would then look for is the person who would say to someone I am not going to impose my belief system on you and you should respect my belief system and not impose yours on me... and Ben Carson gives you that feeling. BEN CARSON for President!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP 2016 Carson looks stoned <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cmon people. The media is just distracting our stupid society with idiots like Trump and Carson. Its time to grow up and stop being so naive to all this trickery. All the infighting within politics is to distract and divide. The whole human society is being played like a bunch fools over and over and over. Time to grow up and wake up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So, if I am to understand this right, most of us Americans love liars!? I mean think about it, people love Hillary, the biggest liar in politics, and now Ben Carson, who is MOST LIKELY lying about his past as an angry black man according to all his past friends who have no recollection of his violence is ahead in polls.. yeah, I love where this country is going...wonder if theres any job openings in Canada? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is very admirable in his strength and courage to not be intimidated by the onslaught of leftist bigots. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is why we need outsiders in Washington. Corruption was just displayed at its finest. Dont care if its Carson or Trump, as long as they clean house once elected. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson ha shattered the stereotype of brain surgeons being smart. Standing by his theory that the pyramids were nothing but grain silos built by the biblical Joseph. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All of this attention on Trumps love affair with the press and I have my eyes on Putin fucking with Obama and making a fool out of all of us. Its time to get mean and dirty and fight back. I just dont see Carson or Hillary leading a charge to regain dominance and regain manufacturing prowess... Yossi <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

nobody likes you mr carson a nobody <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its either this guy or Trump, in my opinion. Carson needs to speak up more though. Not really hearing much from him now <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
America wants another nigger in Ben Carson after the colossal failure Obama? Seriously?! You yanks suck ass. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a vegetarian and I wanted to vote for him, but I found out right after eating a T bone steak off the bbq. I tryed not to like Trump and I cant. His plans are legitimate and hes in the face of the establishment, just like I want to be. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fucking asshole Trump is so narcissistic and his ego is so big, its pathetic! Dumb Americans who support this clown Trump are as stupid as Obamas zombies LOL <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont have any authority whatsoever.... what I can see is that, Trump attacked or counter attacked almost every candidate except Carson so far, which might be the reason why Carson has the chance to leapfrogged trump well beside the ad campaign that kicked in for carson recently. Look at Fiorina, Bush, and others.... The only 3 that surged were cruz, carson and rubio, and 2 out of the 3 werent attacked by Trump until a few days ago. that might means something.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson to his credit would lead Trump on whod they rather have perform brain surgery. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary Clinton needs to be used as an example for all politics and placed in prison to let them know that even they can get prison time <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is simply nuts. Unbelievable that anyone would think him fit for the Presidency..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Some Chinese guys are tennants. This does not mean you are more qualified for presidency. If Carson were in the real estate business he could also. He never says how he will do these things, just I will. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im for Carson 100%. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson criticises political correctness because it stifles free speech, yet he selfcensors to an insane degree to avoid confrontation and talking about big issues. How could this guy ever be a leader? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You can tell Trumptard and all his supporters are scared of Rubio lol. Thats why they gotta keep bashing, while the younger Rubio is being the bigger man. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What do you think Ben Carson would change in the country if he became president? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There are three People that are now most likely to get my vote, Donald Trump, Ben Carson, or Ted Cruz, All three seem like they would do an excellent job as president, Not only for the US but for the US Constitution and the American People, Something that Can not be said for the great Debacle we have at Current, or the Great Debacles that are running for the Democratic Party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I watched the whole video and I do not recall hearing anywhere Donald Trump attacking Ben Carson over faith. Instead, in the very beginning Carson states that he humbly attributes his successes to his walking with the Lord, while Trump doesnt, which ever so slightly smacks of holierthanthou attitude on Carsons side. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The mainstream media, Fox News keeps trying to force people back into the establishment, anyway they possibly can. People are done with the status quo, and rightly so. The elite of the Republican party despise the conservative republican base. They are neocons, moderately liberal flip floppers. And we are done with the establishment stop trying to compare Ben Carson to a failed campaign in 2012. #BenCarson #TedCruz vote for outsiders! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Gotta get Trump in the office. Carson as VP. Originally I thought Carson would be better but then I thought of Trumps character and skill. We need better relations, and a strong leader.

I have to give it to Obama on this one. All these republicans, especially Cruz, bitching, moaning, and whining about the questions from a couple of CNBC commentators, but yet they keep talking about how tough theyll be with Putin is laughable at this point.

Super pacs and Media try to destroy Trump. It will be very hard but if they succeed, do you know who will be next ? Carson. And that will be much easier.

I hope the more intelligent Republicans vote for Bernie Sanders. Cant we just vote for the best person for the job regardless of which party they are in.

The real story is the Republicans dont want Carson ,his Internet polls is still 12 % with the winner Donald Trump even peaking 92 % but at lowest 89 % , so who is going to believe Carson at 12 % will win the Republican Primary ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In all the Internet polls it show Donald Trump at 89 % and Carson at 12 % WHY FOX NEWS PULLING OUR LEG ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nobody even talks about Carson, wtf are you all talking about? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id vote for Trump but not Carson. Big mistake for the GOP to nominate Carson. He does well with batshit crazy evangelicals but he wouldnt do well with a national elections. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul 2016!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson,is a true Christian..so if your of Christ you should be able to see this.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Were starting to learn that Carson has ties to extreme right wing Afrikan American supremicists like Farrakhan. Cool bc science has long proved that the worlds first man was from Afrika. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fox news destroying trump... if you mess with fox news... you lose. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson or Trump. I like both maybe president and vice president would be perfect. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is too soft spoken. Great guy but just too soft spoken... So with that I say Go Donald Go! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah, Reuters Poll not run by Trump says Trump 31% and Carson 18%. Note If you want numbers to jump around just poll NON republicans, felons and illegal aliens. Then pray the American people are asleep. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a moron, he said that Obamacare was the worst thing to happen to this country since slavery. Anyone who would not only say that but believe it is incompetent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON SHOULD CARRY A WEAPON WITH HIM AT ALL TIMES AND IT SHOULD BE DEEMED FULLY LEGAL FOR HIM. FURTHERMORE, NOW THAT HE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, HE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST ONE FULLY ARMED BODYGUARD WITH HIM AT ALL TIMES. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE HIM. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont think Carson is sincere. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a baldfaced liar. He had a relationship with Mannatech. Love how any question they ask now is a gotcha question. If you cant handle questions from moderators, how could you ever handle being POTUS? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
funny how dr carson is being lured into participating in dog whistle politics.. inner city just say poor blacks.. smh <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson, a prince among men. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahaha if you put trump as the head of the gop then dont expect any liberals to switch over. Theres a better chance with Carson, because he is black. My opinion is Hillary is going to win anyways!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Excuse me, but its the majority of Republicans that are for Trump and Carson not all Americans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To me Carson alwaxys appears high... Guess that why he forgot all about science <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben COON carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will be voting for Marco Rubio in the primaries but I would definitely support Carson in a general election matchup against Hillary Clinton. God help us if she gets elected, this Country will crumble. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Btw Rand, by the same token of logic you use He must be smart cause hes rich you could use on Ben Carson since he was a doctor. But quite clearly, Carson is a delusional die hard christian psycho. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What media bias would that be, Carson, you Evangelical Neocon idiot!? The US media is nothing but a government stenographer which does the bidding of whoever is in power. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Our constitution protects everybody, unless we want to deny one group the right to marry. Then we can discriminate, because our religion does not approve. Ben Carsons illconcealed duplicity and hypocrisy are appalling. His blatant lie about his involvement with an unscrupulous drug company reveals much about his character. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The debate was always going to be 2 hours long? So what was the article I read two weeks about CNBC trying to get a 3 hr debate and Trump and Carson threatening not to show up if they didnt change it? I guess i imagined reading that article lol John Harwood showed us hes a LIAR. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carly is incredibly smart and quick on her feet in a debate scenario, im sure she will rip these women apart on Friday. I cant wait! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fiorina runs circles around those cackling hens in style, smarts, looks, and poise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson , another one that thinks the world is 6,000 years old and satan did the big bang ,the world was created in six 24hour days ...ok we have entered crazy land <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson ahead of trump in polls? or just another shameless attempt by media orgs. to tell people what to believe. when the average carson supporter reads the drudge report on carsons tenure as surgeon maybe well be on the same page. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio nor Carson can do shit for this country right now! We need Trump and fast! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck... Carson is a terrible substitute for Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TED CRUZ initiated that whole attack on the liberal media. All the other FOLLOWED HIM. Not Trump, nor Rubio, nor this Carson LEAD the way...they followed TED CRUZ. CRUZ IS THE REAL LEADER AND PROVED IT BEYOND A DOUBT CENTER STAGE. Dont support these glory thieves! SUPPORT TED CRUZ, THE REAL LEADER. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Rubio wins the democrats are fucked <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is a negro bed wench! being the slave of the kkk network fox news! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why do we need to have 1 president? I think 3 presidents at same time would be best. 3 minds working instead of 1. Im saying lets have Bush, Hillary and Trump together as president. Living together in white house together. Sharing bathroom and drinking coffee together over the briefing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I used to respect mr Carson but know he s just another nigger to me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Man Carsons campaign manager needs to stop hanging out with Chris Christie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if you notice that youtube only will let so much Carson videos on. when you search carson its mostly people talking crap about the little that he has said. like secular talk and young turks. i feel that youtube cators to a certain party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP MEANS BUSINESS! TIME TO GET TOUGH! nice guys Carson finish last. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is antigay you stupid right wing whore! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I believe on rights for everybody... Except for gay people <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is one lousy contradiction..the guy is a CUNT. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As Ben Carson seeks the Republican nomination for president, he also drawing notice to the church that has counted him as a member since he was a child. Read more here worldnationalarticle42167277.html#storylinkcpy <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson has all the personality of a brick , but I have to credit to the brick for being smarter ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone who doesnt support Ben Carson is Racist, we need another strong black man in the white house like Obama was. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the reason WHY they ask these questions is because THE REPUBLICAN CAMP IS VIEWED THIS WAY BECAUSE U GUYS SUCK AT DEBATING REAL ISSUES fuckin ben carson shouting taking away guns caused the holocaust and trump shouting mexicans are rapists and dont get me started on all the religious BULLCRAP the republican camp has been spouting out US is a christian country.... NO ITS NOT ITS SECULAR! SMH!! OLD PEOPLE SHOULD JUST DIE INSTEAD OF WATCHING FAIL FOX NEWS. there i said it FUCK EM! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
His new name should be Dr. Plant. The Republican Party planted a black contender to help diversify the party. It only cost 50million. Ask Herman Cain. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Can you imagine dr. Carson in a negotiation with Putin? Carson will be pouring the vodka and asking a.. a... anything else, saar? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Strength, knowledge and independence. That is true freedom! That is real life and Ben wants to share that message because he found it. People of any nationality would be wise to listen. God bless Mr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fiorina is a NEOCON in a skirt who would pump billions to defense contractors and provoke a nuclear war with RussiaChina. She is the dream candidate for Raytheon and LockheedMartin shareholders. She is even more bellicose than McCain, if that is possible. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson seems like a nice guy but honestly hes the worst republican candidate. He knows the least about the government and politics and many times he cant answer a question well <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No doubt that CNBC moderators had bad tone and used rude word choice, but many of their points were valid. Carsons taxbudget plan does not add up. Trumps wall paid by Mexico, deporting all illegals and bringing some back, the whole idea that everyone else is incompetent except him, etc. etc. is so unrealistic and juvinile that it does sound like a comic book campaign... but CNBC should have found a more polite way of discussing these. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is so much better than Obama is a joke. He is also light years ahead of other black leaders like Jesse Jackson and others. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
they didnt do the iowa match up for carson vs clinton? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The left attacks Ben Carson because he is an idiot. His faith is part of that idiocy. As for OReilly prompting him that the left is attacking him because he is black, that may be the most stupid thing ever said on FOX. Obama 08 012 ring a bell? Bill ORetard <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All hail Ben Carson!!!! D <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I liked the moment it showed Ben Carsons poll compared to Donald Trumps poll. P <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson for president, and I have been republican all my life but this time I am fully convinced this is the man we need to lead this country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bless Ben Carson. We need him as president. Im suck of turds that dont care about their lives. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
here we go again Trump tells them here is a problem and this how Im going to fix it. Fox News. lol trots some so called expert out to say he cant do that. we have a saying in the south cant never did anything with the exception of Carson all the others have had a chance to fix VIA and I dont think Carson has what it takes to get it done. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz came out as the winner! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stoppushing Ben Carson. He wont win. You are idiots for thinking you can trade white votes for black votes. No one wants another black President. Obama proved they are black first. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump wants shorter debate to concentrate information and reduce ad time and profiting at the peoples expense....cnbc has to comply because him and Carson have too much leverage....cnbc ends up striking back by disallowing substantive questions to allow gop to help voters make an educated decision, again at the expense of the people. Fucks <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We have a panel of people from all political backgrounds, and they are all REPUBLICANS yep, thats fox news for you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The american people are not each others enemies, its those who are trying to divide us that are the enemy And who would that be, gays for wanting equal rights? Very clever doublespeak attacking gays in a backhanded way, Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Way to go Dr. Carson. When asked about your involvement with Costco instead of answering the question you used it as a chance to further the argument that you are unqualified for this job. You say that the Constitution provides for everyone and protects all people but yet you still believe in inequality. Thank you for clearing up the foggy air by blowing smoke up our butts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben carson best candidate ever since JFK <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson creeps me the hell out <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im sure Carson is a very good Republican front runner, but is that really saying much, considering who his opponents are. Trump? BLAH. Bush MK3? BLUH. Not only that, but bringing raceethnicity into the Presidential campaign atall is profoundly racist. Noone should care whatsoever about the colour of Ben Carsons skin, all that matters is the mans character and his political beliefs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Unless you are already aware that the Chaplin for the United States Senate is a Seventh Day Adventist you should go look up Rear Admiral Barry Black on wikipedia. Someone whos life story is very similar to Dr Carsons. OReilly should be ashamed of himself. At Fox they are all invested in the Republican Establishment. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a fucking liar who lied about endorsing a product when theres video of him doing it because it didnt fit his nice guy image. The guy is worth 30 million dollars but is trying to play himself as this nice humble Christian man. I feel sorry for his supporters who bought his new book because thats why hes really running. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy Ben carson won my vote, this guy is a citizen and a real patriot, hes getting better with the media, hell be ready . Ben Carson 2015 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Oh, yea...the experienced politicians have done their jobs Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo well the past two or three decades. Yea, we all want more of that. Thats what were really looking for. Who are these bozos? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Ben carson, he sounds like a walking sleeping pill <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You mean the final 3, Trump, Carson, Fiorina. These are the only people we are interested in. They have never held an elected office. The rest of them are participants in betrayal except maybe Cruz and Paul. Cruz maybe for Attorney General. Paul for IRS secretary. The rest of the lot should get out, especially Rubio, Jeb, and Fat Boy. Not to mention that habitual liar who all Marines Hate, Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has a messianic complex, is obviously enamoured with himself, and thinks he is Gods gift to the world. I can and will do without him and vote for Rubio, the only REALLY qualified GOP candidate offering real solutions to the nations problems with a proven record. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump or Carson..........Anything but a Low Life Demo <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
that reporter is mean for two reasons firstly, he WAS goading Carson to say something terrible that would cause a controversy and secondly he did not sincerely appreciate Carsons birthday wishes, may be he thought it was phony and political or hes had too many bad experiences with birthdays.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
all you Russians over here better help out..We love ya here..Vote Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is full of crap! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Didnt Ben Carson get them all together?????? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ll, Im starting to like Carson. He used the word fairness to all. Went on to say we can be fair to gays and still have marriage in the traditional sense. And make absolutely no mistake. There is a huge divide. Its put there on purpose by guys like Hannity and Ed Shultz ...and I must say that if I was in absolute power? About half of Fox News would be behind bars. Theres a shadow govt and we need to expose them <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You and Carson are not politicians EXACTLY! thats why i want them in office! so sick of experienced politicians that dont do shit. George Washington, Dwight Eisenhower and many others were not experienced politicians either <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Todd Starnes is a human skidmark. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

how can a Doctor like ben carson who swore a hypcratic oath do no harm even run for president and commander in chief , how can you haveyour finger on the button like most americans say, or order troops to war or start an act of war which will be your duties as american president, like i said you took the oath so i guess your word is shit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Every time I listen to Ben Carson, it humbles me. Each time I watch his videos, I become a little bit better of a person thats why I think he should be the leader of our nation. And the guy is literally a genius <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery. Therefore, beanbag Carson thinks that the Jim Crow laws were better than Obamacare. What a moron... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It was obvious Rubio and Cruz and Christie won this debate. Carson and Trump were right in the middle of the pack. Carson and Trump will remain at the top. But i predict the next poll with have Carson, Trump Rubio Cruz at the top 4 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

5 on Trump and Carson? Whatever. Joe Biden proved that you cant hang your hat on the opinion of these talking heads. He embarrassed these people beyond belief. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is a joke I actually like Jeb Bush but would never vote for him because of his brother. Rubio seems like hes all talk. Slimy politician. Huckabee is a joke lol Kinda like Carson Cruz is cool but too right wing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love how the video is called Donald Trump attacks Ben Carson over faith, when Carson was the one who started it and originally questioned Trumps faith. Most every thing Trump has attacked others on has been him retaliating to an original attack from someone else, but of course the media wouldnt report on the original attack, only the retaliation from Trump. Because the media hates Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is serving his purpose. His poll numbers will begin to decline and he will support either Cruz or Carson. That said, calling Kasich out for claiming he is the reason Ohio has rebounded. It is the state legislature that has carried the load and done a great job. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
President Trump and vice President Carson, or President Carson and vice President Trump. Qualified people need to begin to take a look at serving their government. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If you call people hating on Carson as being the most talked about during the last debate you are right. Trump won that debate and did this one or at least close imo. The people decide who wins not a few bias tv annalists. TRUMP 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hmmmm, hes reaching out to the different campaigns, sharing a new vision, and trying to change the course of something. Kind of sounds like True Leadership to me. I can understand how everyone can be confusedwe dont see true leadership very often. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The only talking heads whining about the CNN moderators or their ?s are the racist, sexist, homophobic Republi cans their ilk. IMO the moderators were razor sharp fact checked those blow hards around every turn. The debate was awesome, but now I bet the next one will be stacked with right wing types will be a total snooze fest, every one of these Republic bafoons getting on their soap boxes to run out the two hours st8 into an old rerun of The Golden Girls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

after witnessing 3 GOP debates and the 1st Dem Debate, only a fool wont notice the stark difference. they hit hard on GOP and the other Dem debate, the questions are SOOO NICE and BORING to say the least.

Kelly, TRUMP went in as the front runner a day before, not Carson but almost. More lies! Carson is about tied with Trump in Iowa and thats it. Trump kills it in every other state and poll.

Love Dr Carson. Such a leader <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is not black, he was not black when he was growing up, he does not relate to black people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is on the Trump Train. Finally someones other than Trump is bringing it to the peoples attention, the media is corrupt and so bias. I wanted to see real questions asked, not these clownmediamoderators trying to cash in on Trump with stupid nonpolitical questions. Total BS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary is a shit head. GO CARSON <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trap them you say, how about trumps words there babies trying to handle killers? I think most of them were a epic fail. they refuse to answer questions that matter and then cried about it. cnbc is a place where republicans get friendly news coverage. I guess they dont believe in their policies or they would have answered them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is ahead by 1828 % Carson is nowhere even close, this is a lie! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id vote for Ben Carson, but Ted Cruz is my favorite. He and Mike Lee were the only ones that stood against Democrats and the traitor Republicans on Obama Care and tried to get things done. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If were gonna thin the heard, then for the love of god, get rid of those who are polling lower than Hilary! So that would only leave Bush, Carson, Rubio, and I think thats it! Hell, Cruz is getting beat by Clinton by 13 points in... the Fox News poll! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will be voting for Mr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson seems like a reasonable man, but jesus christ he sounds like hes hosting an NPR podcast <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a neurosurgeon a great one but is that the resume you want for the 2016 president. Ben Carson stated that hes still learning about foreign policy and my question is do we want someone to learn on the job especially the commander and chief of this nation its not flipping burgers at McDonalds is running a country for god sakes <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is a retired neurosurgeon so I think he is well aware of not only the trials of surgery itself but also the financial trials and hardships. Its a refreshing and long awaited change, ...... someone who wants to heal, revive and make this nation what it was always meant to me. Faith, honesty and integrity, ...... traits that God endowed in each of us ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Duh! Because our President needs to uphold our Constitution! VOTE CARSON!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wish Carson would have pointed out that there is no such thing as homophobia, it is a relatively new, invented word meant to paint anyone with traditional views on marriage as having a mental disorder. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahaha at 203 Trump winks at Ben Carson. Trump rules! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This man is one of the best presidential candidates we have ever had. A man of integrity who understands the constitution is there to handcuff the government instead of the people. We need more candidates like this to overcome the people who have no principal but to dominate the people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not a Cruz fan, I would rather have Trump or Carson nominated. However Cruz is right about the questions asked. Those questions asked by MSNBC wernt relevant and wasnt what the public wanted to hear. We want to hear the candidates debate their positions on issues. We didnt want to hear insults by the moderators and gotcha questions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Ben Carson wins the nomination, Hillary Clinton can sit back and wait for the presidency with no effort at all. That guy seems to be sleepy, not interested or what? What a disaster!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Never have seen Dr. Carson ever struggle with a question. Pretty amazing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I totally agree with Dr. Ben Carson.....100%. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has not said shit that matters. He is a political wuss. Maybe he could say something in just one debate other than I really dont want to discuss that subject or Im not going there. Always some excuse. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wow Megan Really. You couldnt even end the interview without pushing your AntiTrump Agenda.

Isnt there someone else out there? Trump, Carson, Clinton, Sanders? is this the best we can find for a potential leader of the free world? I think not. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

They didnt give Trump hardly any air time. TRUMP 2016!!! Carson loves super pacs, and I cant see his weak personality beating Hillary Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Either Benjamin Carson or Donald Trump would be great as President even though they are quite a bit different. Anyone else is useless. Although I think anyone would be better then Obama <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Now Fox is trying to push Ben Carson. Pure Bull Shit. Trump is killing all the polls after the debate. Report that. How about the likeability with the media <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The problem is that you dont think for yourself! You always use the bible as some justification for something moronic you say. If you thought for yourself, you wouldnt side with the bibles creation story over evolution. But no, evolution must be wrong because the bible said blah blah blah. Carson, I am truly amazed by your success in Neuroscience. Especially since you think the earth is 610 thousand years old! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Where does carson buy his good weed? Only TRUMP 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hail to Ben Carson! This man is our USA only hope. Obama is doing all he can to bankrupt the USA and Ben is our turning point.

The fact that Carson can even stumic scum like OReily shows how commited he is for the American people. He has my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I find it sad the only attacks at Dr Carson are attacks against his appearance and his wifes appearance by liberals. Especially since they are supposed to be so tolerant and progressive. It just proves how useless and petty the liberals so called progressives truly are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think the republican debates have to be narrowed to those who can win swing voters, whilst representing the republican values. so widdle it down to Trump, Carson, Paul, and Fiorina. The rest are jokers. These four are powerful and can destroy Sanders or Clinton in any open debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Soo...trick im glad you have such a great understanding of american politicspretty sure how boring a candidate is has absolutely nothing to do with it...if you wouldnt vote for carson because hes boring you clearly have inadequate judgements on politicians... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am muslim born not religious Trump supporter and I consider myself progressive but I am not offended by Dr Carson, he seems like a genuinely great guy. The liberal left hates Dr Carson because they cant stand an honest black man who could think for himself, they hate his guts. You dont call these liberals progressives, they are, if anything racists and regressives. A TrumpCarson ticket would be a dream come true for me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Stephen Sigmund, are you for real? Arent you listening or are you just lying? Carson was clear from the start, and then he explained what he meant.

Trump IS still leading in the polls going into this debate.... New highly respected poll today shows Trump with 32% Carson with 18% which is consistent with most other polls that have come out. leadsnationallyaheadgopthirddebate Also, If tonights debate is about the Economy and jobs as reported, thenTrump has it in the bag. Watch for post debate polls to have Trump touching 50% nationally. <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson says he is not a politician... Of course he is... He is just better at hiding it... Hell, Trump could also say he is not a politician but does not. The only reason boring Ben Carson is popular is because he is black like Barrack Obama, even if he has no specific ideas for America. At least Donald Trump shows what his plans are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump is not wobbling in the polls. Tied with Carson in Iowa now and Trumps 36% vs Carsons 22% nationwide and creaming the polls in every other state. Where did you get this guy? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
New Poll October 27, 2015 Trump LEADS by 14% ! Well, it was fun for awhile. Reality has arrived. SO much for the Carson False Narrative. Poll results at Hill.com.....look for Trump leads by 14. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I can just see the black racists like Jessie Jackass and Al Sharptongue lining up to call Carson an Uncle Tom.That is how Black Liberals roll. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I dont believe that polls change that fast and that drastic. Just the other day Trump was way ahead of Carson in all the polls and then literally overnight they flip flopped. That many people changed their minds in a day or 2? I dont buy it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
look at the glum faces... it is worth tuning for, then listen their veiled attempt to ask people to disregard Carson. This is vintage I am going to have to buy a high storage external hard drive I am going to have a lot of hours of materials to have a laugh for the coming years, lol the circus is already in town I cant wait for the main attraction. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As an independent, Dr . Carson is probably best, most balanced, least likely bought by lobbyist , and most likely understand all classes of America! ladies if you exclude money factor, if you has a choice of picking a father or husbamd, you would likely pick him than any other republican than any other candidate. Trump is least likely to be chosen as a person unless you are gold digger. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who cares about what the main stream believes. Theres sooo many Americans out there, as farmers, construction workers, outdoorsmen and such that believe as he does, and some maybe most dont use social media because there too busy working and living life! Social media could be the best and worst this ever in this country. GO BEN CARSON! But I do not like that stupid forcing vaccination on the country <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Republicanism has become so similar to Fascist Nazi Germany, its almost hilarious if it wasnt so frightening. Ben Carson has definitely suffered brain damage, maybe he should operate on himself and try to resuscitate the few brain cells that he may have left. The man sounds and acts like he is on drugs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trumps aggressive strategy will likely backfire with voters against Carson. Just my prediction. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a sleeping pill, but hes better than the militant lesbian Hillary Cliton. Could you imagine if we let these perverts, the Clintons, back into the White House? Hillary will be having lesbian sex with that Muslim woman, Huma, who is in a fake marriage to another pervert Anthony Weiner. Between Bill, Hillary, Huma, and Weiner, that makes four super perverts under the sheets in the Lincoln Bedroom. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Its hard to believe how hard Fox is trying to take down Trump....When Carson just took the stance that he is against abortion even in the case of Rape Incest....Nobody will ever get to the White House with that stance the left will have a field day with it. Once again Fox the establishment are picking us a loser!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It was just a matter of time. Trump went into campaign a household name, Ben Carson well known in medical, political, and intellectual circles, so took a little longer to get his message out. Donalds act is getting stale and his spoiled rich kid antics are wearing thin. Ben Carsons speeches are much more educational and entertaining and richer with substance, and his strong patriotic American persona is connecting with many voters.

Funny, if it was bush and Rubio on top they would be referring them to being on the top tier. But because its trump and Carson, they are sure that the polls really dont matter. Had it been any other 2 polling the same the media would be talking a different story <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

He was asked about Israel a few months back and he didnt have a clue, L0L <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Trump keeps talking like this I tell you he will be president of United States this guy is coming off really well I like him he and Carson need to get together and make some kind of plan to keep out Hilary I mean Hillary it might be a good thing if him and get together they just need to come to disagree and not get upset. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont understand how American media can be so bias. How do people watch this rubbish and believe what is being said? There is always an agenda. How do the average normal American citizens get their unbiased news? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The crazier Carson gets, the more Republicans support him! Lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OReilly is not even in the same building as Carson intellectually... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is too wishy washy. It will take a man like Trump in order to get the country back on the right path. He is not afraid to speak the truth. The media is pushing Carson because they know Trump can win. They need Trump out of the picture so Hillary can beat Carson. The winner has already been chosen, people will have the illusion of choice when they vote, but in reality they have no choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dana should know how to read a poll. With 6% moe, the poll is pretty much meaningless with that margin of error, the poll says Trump could be as high as 28% and Carson as low as 18%. Besides, I cant see Republicans leaving the house to vote for a black Forrest Gump. Get real FOX. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
NOTHING BUT LIES we dont believe anything FOX has to say. You can take that to the bank! LIES by the establishment! #AMERICAWANTSDONALDTRUMPFORPRESIDENT Whatever happened to Ben Carson who was taking time off from campaigning to sell his book???? LIES NOTHING BUT LIES!!! We dont buy it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Carson takes the gop, Hillary is going win hands down. Therell be mass urgency to have a women president because prior there has been a colored president. If Donald wins gop hell take presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson but I fear he may split the antiestablishment vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant stand these weasels. Yall distort everything. Carson said muslims that support sharia law wouldnt fit the roll of an American leader. Which MOST americans dont think a caliphate is inevitable..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Morally degenerate people dont like Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would not let Trump operate on my brain, and I would not let Carson run my big business, only Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Turd Blossom is still polishing the Bush familys turds. Jeb is doomed and the GOP will crumble under the idiocy of Trump and Carson, which is one step from President Commacho. Rubio? Ha! There is no chance for our young and thirsty friend. Face it right wingnuts your going to have to start Feeling the Bern if you want to back a winner. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
its fox news that is out of touch with the mainstream not Ben Carson. Ben Carsons appeal is being a man of integrity against the corrupt lying establishment but fox news is part of that establishment so they wouldnt know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Calm, confidant, crazy Ben Carson is the flavor of the month. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WE WANT BEN CARSON.... GO CARSON GO.. WELL DONE... just throw trump in the shit hole.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
jeb is about to say like... the intelligence department about Syrians will bring in isis, that its not true like he is trying too keep the truth from the American public, my goodness I sure hope Trump becomes the President, and about hillary its only because trump has been keeping the truth real about hillary, also with Trump behind carson its a Lie, trump is still winning in Iowa, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Americans elect Carson they will get exactly what they deserve. Adios America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hm Carson would be incredible great puppet for me , isolated guys are best <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson will do well in places with high numbers of batshit crazy evangelicals but he couldnt win a general election. Carson V Hillary I vote third party Carson V Sanders I vote Sanders Trump V Sanders or Clinton I probably vote Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The poll is laughable. The establishment is getting desperate considering Trump was just crushing everyone like 5 days ago in a natl poll. Nothing significant happened since then. Regardless, let Carson hang himself. Dont waste time attacking him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trumps 38% and carson 22% <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How is CARSON not a divisive figure? 90% of blacks consider him, or ANY black Republican, for that matter, an Uncle Tom! Conservatives have long since given up on attracting the black vote anywhere, so where is the DIVISIVENESS going to make any difference in the election at all? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
its actually 38% for trump and carson is actually 1822% <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you enjoy the 25 to 30 million illegals that are currently in the country ? Then you are going to orgasm over the 25 to 30 million more that Carson will allow in . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a good guy but not Presidential. Trump not appealing to hardcore religionists is a strength not a weakness, because hes a moderate not a hard liner. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is backed by special interest and their money is being spent, so the puppet Carson is bought and paid for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump for president, Carson for vice president. I think that would be best case. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is leading in every state even Iowa this poll are not right even if they where trump is still leading 49 state out of 50 the media want to break our momentum cause now we even beat Hilary head to head there no one trump can beat but we must keep the faith and keep ignoring the media I like Carson but he to soft and inexperienced he cant get the job done maybe make a good vp for his faith but not president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson wants to cure gay people... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Americans vote in Carson they will get exactly what they deserve. Adios America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im behind you Donald. I believe you are going to beat that mutherfucker Carson down into the hole he came out of. I know you understand that the average person is about as smart as someone on the OJ Simpson jury, that can be the only explanation for the pole slippage in Iowa. I mean it is so obvious that you are much much better than Carson its ridiculous. I think people just want to do the opposite of what they think is right for some reason, likely out of spite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson? for what? wat can he do? wat? nothing? dats right nothing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mike Tyson endorses Donald Trump for president. We people want Trump. People with no tie to EstablishmentsLobbyists will vote for Trump. Trump for president 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THIS NOT GOING TO WORK BECAUSE TRUMP IS INSECURE ABOUT CARSON WHILE CARSON COULD CARE LESS. THIS IS WHY TRUMP IS IN THE EFFEMINATE POSITION COMMENTING ON CARSON. THIS IS WHY CARSON IGNORES HIM LIKE A BITCH. WOULDNT IT BE POETIC JUSTICE IF A BLACK MAN WAS YOUR NOMINEE? TOO FUNNY. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What about Carsons connection to Louis Farrakhan? When are the media going to talk about that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Poor Americans... having to choose between a sociopath and liar Clinton, an arresteddevelopment maleversion Sarah Palin Trump, yet another fundamentalist coocoo and Islamophobe Carson, and a cranky old Granddad who just yells and yells and yells Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If 10 million American believe that sharia law should be the law of the land then those 10million people should stop calling themselves American and should never hold a place in office in the USA! Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What Carson says isnt even that controversial, the media takes him out of context <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I seriously hope Carson or Trump wins the GOP nomination. It will be hilarious to watch Bernie or Hilary trounce them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BS on top of BS , we all know no White Republican will vote that piece of crap into the white house ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its a travesty we have people spouting creation running for the President. Carson as well as the majority of the GOP need to go back to caves. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This moderater is a hack robot using the same tired tactics. You clowns think youre geniuses. Massive hypocrisy about Carson being attacked when theyve lived inside Obamas ass for 7 years. These euroclowns go to all lengths to insult ou Intelligence with this verbal thuggery. I speak truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yall say Ben is a nut case why ? because he believes in God oh okay so thats why lol. Yall are the crazy people this man is very intelligent <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Amnesty loving Ben Carson who supports more H1B visas, who doesnt believe in legalizing pot and has said he will double down on the drug war, leading in the polls??? Another lazy negro in the White House??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

pat is a fucking racist pig. u can see a racist a mile away. they have this dirty oder to them of hate. I am not backing Carson But I am sad that the best nation for everyone still have racist pigs like trump keep talking crap open. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is great. Also, how many people are killed by the popular school killings compared to how many homeless people are killed for nothing every year.. Totally out of perspective. We should all be able to have guns. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only accurate thing these biased, deceptive pundits said was, this election is very hard to predict. they think they can predict everything based on history, well guess what, history is MADE through CHANGE, and try as you might you cant stop this one! TRUMPCARSON 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is walking Ambien Pill ,who in their mind would vote for this turtle in a nut shell <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump still has the balls that Americans lost to political correctness, And Carson has the heart that Americans can understand..... If they teamed up we could see major changes in the next 4 years TrumpCarson 2014 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

TRUMP ANDOR CARSON 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson didnt say that he wouldnt want a muslim being president. In fact, he said that he thinks a muslim should every right to be president as anyone else. He actually said that he doesnt believe that a muslim following Sharia Law should be president. I agree with that %100. If you disagree with that then look up what Sharia law is, and then come back to me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is amazing. If you argue me, youre wrong, dont waste your time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson and Jeb make me go to bed, dont be in a slump vote for TRUMP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I truly do hope Ben Carson wins the presidential election. There are way too many racists in the Republican party who would vote for him. Many Republicans will stay home on election day if Carson wins, just like during the 2012 election with Romney when Republicans refused to vote for him because he was a Mormon and they deemed him too liberal. If Ben Carson wins, Clinton or Sanders will be our next president. No doubt about it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I like Ben Carson. I think hes more honest by far than any other Rep candidate, and almost all Dem candidates. But President? Youve got to be kidding. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We all know the democratic candidates that are left are Feeling the Bern. Why dont they talk about Carson and Trump Feeling the Bern as well. Carson has changed his stance on Medicare and Medicaid and.... NOW..... Trump is talking ill about campaign finance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sluggish Ben Carson is what we need.... He is sleepy, low energy, and cant keep his eyes open when he talks... I like Obama so another tired Black guy is fine with me! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It seems as is Carson has trouble keeping his eyes open.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
im a democrat who voted Kerry04 Oboma08 and 2012 but Ben Carsons SDA Faith makes me consider voting republican for the first time having a Seventh Day Adventist for a candidate for myself being Seventh Day Adventist he makes me want to vote republican for the first time ever. WoW no cant do it kinda want to though voting Hillary all the way? wait cant make up mind <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love Ben Carson and im a democrat i guess im crazy sometimes beliefs make you a better person and Ben Carson to me seems like a really good person <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON YOU ARE BETTER AS A DOCTOR .DOCTORS ARE NEEDED . TRUMP IS BETTER AS A PRESIDENT <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
AS LONG AS CARSON BEATS HILARY THE LIAR .BUT STILL PREFER FEARLESS TRUMP .OK CARSON CUT OUT THE BULLSHIT .THE POPE IS NOT EVEN AS RELIGIOUS AS YOU .BUNCH OF CRAP. GO TRUMP GO ...WE NEED DOCTORS LIKE YOU YOU ARE BETTER THERE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont know where Ben Carson has been, but all the stuff hes saying Black people should march on, thats already been done and has never stopped for 396 years. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why is carson talking about slave masters???? when its 2015 and we have a black president and we pay no talent rappers and ball players billions of dollars to dribble a basketball or sing nursery rhymes??? im pretty sure we have already proven whites arent racist dont u think people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
IF YOU DONT VOTE FOR BEN CARSON YOUR JUST FUCKING STUPID!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WOW this is hard to believe that Carson thinks like most educated white non racist people! so hard to believe lol if carson was white he would be called a hater and a racist for hating blacks and not understanding their struggle etc etc....this in itself actually shows how racist the media has become against whites. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bahahaha then the people realize and immediately switch to Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson but man did he totally blow that question and he knows it, what a flub response <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I could see Mr. Carson as a VP to Mr. Trump but I just cant see Mr. Carson dealing with the U.N. or other world powers. I would like to see Carson and trump team up and finish the pack off. I think together they both have a grate deal to offer then all the rest put together <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One of the more revolting, and infinitely stupid, candidates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
38% for trump, and carson... has maybe 18% real number as of 537pm Eastern. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck these Bitches! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id vote for trump but never for Carson. Carson stands no chance of winning the general election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As far as Im concerned, no gaff! I will vote for Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wrong. NBC would offer them a chance to host. Bad idea because there would be a backlash against the candiates. Ben Carson would like generate as much interest as Trump. Killary has already had her turn, Hahahahahahah. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He who defends Black lives matter is making political suicide. Ben Carson has to not alienate the white voters no matter what his actual view is on the matter. Compare this to Bernie Sanders who declared out loud that Black lives matter. He ignore the harm that will make to his chances of getting elected and stand by what he believes in. Bernie had fought for the Blacks even as a college student. In terms of character, no candidate is his equal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016. Everyone twists his words to make him look like the bad guy, but he really just speaks the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Listening to Ben Carson is like taking a melatonin pill. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
iowapresidentialrepublicanprimary Actually, the new poll shows Carson up by a whopping 14 points and 10 points on average. Sorry Trump goons. <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson questioned Trumps faith, then apologized. So he s open to hit back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Being a 7th day adventist is perfect for Ben Carson because on the 7th day God rested and Ben Carson always sounds like hes just woke up from a 12 hour rest. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am not sure about the low energy, but Carson is weak on immigration and trade, I totally agree. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Comments from Carson that need to be considered. 1. On climate change temperature goes up and down meh 2. Disband the Ministry of Education.... These two points alone should dissuade folks from him. Sanders is the best bet at this instant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson literally got me into something that I disliked like politics <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sigmund did nothing but state things Ben Carson said incorrectly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Once people realize that Carson isnt just a whimpering soft excuse for a man but that hes also a 7th day adventist... we know how its going to go. Many people didnt vote Romney because of his connection to a deviant chirstianesque cult once they find out the 7DA are even more cult like than mormon... theyre going to run from Carson as fast as they flocked too him. Of course Carson wont notice because his eyes are too close together. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Did they mention Trump is leading every other poll or only Iowa counts? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets not beat around the bush. Muslim beliefs conflict with our constitution. There is no way a practicing Muslim can lead America. Tired of the PC bullshit. One thing I appreciate about Ben Carson is that he doesnt beat around the bush like most if not all politicians do. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love so much that Dr. Carson Refuses t get in the mud pit! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahaha what a joke these Political pundits are. Trump is blowing EVERYONE out of the water in literally every state but Iowa. Speaking of which, get some fucking sensibility Iowans and stop picking your candidate based on their religious beliefs for fucks sake <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is dumber than smoke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
With inexperienced radicals, in Trump Carson, trying to infiltrate, the GOP Gong Show has devolved into the Right Wing circus we saw in PreNazi Germany. The radicals are trying to usurp congress, and have made Fox News a beer hall. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Steve Dussy is smarter than Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
27% vs 27% in Iowa, as of now on 10262015PM. Your religion can not be antiAmerican in order to be president. Now the media has admitted the polls are real. There has been no other movement not H. C. like this. Trump pulls even with Carson, within hours of Carsons surge... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump need not attack Dr Ben. All he has to do is let Carson speak and voters can see for themselves that the man is profoundly dumb. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The one thing that the world is seeing about America is the debt. And how much longer will this rapidly climbing debt continue.. Now questions from with in America, Are we prospering as a nation and for how much longer? Who will make jobs? Who will protect the country from war? Who will protect the borders?... All good questions. But who is the right choice? I think both Trump and Carson can do the job. I just dont see Carson as a leader, no offence to those who do. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson Weak on immigration. Weak on trade. Pro forced mandatory vaccinations. Anti marijuana legalization. Wants to abolish Medicare. Lacks energy and enthusiasm. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If anyone is low energy, its Carson. I dont think he will accomplish much. Also, Im not religious. Trump 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The power the Democrats utilize is racial division, gender division, etc. when we are all just people. Racism is over for the most part in USA but they want your mind to stay on their mental plantation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson might be a little too nice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All this shows is the GOP is a Gong Show, which has become increasingly radical. We see this with inexperienced radicals, in Ben Carson Herr Trump, getting much of the press. Reminds me of the early stages of the Nazi Party, or the Black Shirt movement with Il Duce. Fox News is morphing into a beer hall....They dont have any mad geniuses, though. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
media seem to realize they have no chance to make us support Bush however they succeeded with Hillary and she leads there which doesnt say anything good about Dems... How can they support her? and Im afraid they are using Carson to move the support from Trump doesnt work with me! then they just treat Carson the way they treated Ron Paul in 2012.They are afraid of Trump because unlike Carson and Ron Paul, he will not be ignored! And his supporters with him! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Visit a SDA church and you wont vote for Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is a real Black Man. Obama is not. Ben Carson came from meger background. Obama did not. Ben Carson will not have to hide his background like Obama did. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the only candidate who really respects the peoples views, dreams and efforts to rebuild America. God bless him even more. Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ok, so I see why Trump is bringing up the fact that Carson is Seventh Day Adventist. They seem like a cult. I never heard of this religion until few years ago when my coworker was one. Someone made a joke that they made pies or something similar every Saturday. I thought it was a joke... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I somehow I through Megyn, Rush and ORielly would have disliked Ben Carson however its clear they like him...right? These are 3 people I never liked and never supported their opinion until now. I am not a Republican and I hate politics but Ben Carson has my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So we spend twice as much for healthcare as most other nations... according to Einstein Carson here... doesnt take into account that we have 5 times the population as most other nations. Twice the expense for 5 times the population and this sounds alarming to him? When will there be a conservative who understands how numbers work? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wait... hes a 7th day adventist!?! Oh my god, last time was a mormon now were moving even further into the world of the occult. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont want to get into the mud pit its not my nature then he insults Donald Trump on his faith? lol Ben carson really? what a lying piece of shit! anyone who would vote for Ben Carson over Donald Trump isnt a real republican. Just the same old establishment candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not sure if DR. Carson belive that Jesus will come back on Oct 22, 1844. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am African and all the way from here the Ben Carson Story is a faith based story. I have known this story since I was a kid. I dont know if he is president material, i have always just known his faith story. He will have to convince the American people. Ck <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think this guy was grown in a test tube by the GOP to fool the right. Ben Carson is truly screwed in the head, and speaks of the problems within our conservative population. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Pro choice, amazing rebuttal... Carson is a the right choice , I liked how he still had respect for Trump and how he recognized that theyre probably the only candidates without handlers <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I would recommend for Mr. Carson to let black lives matter evolve on its own. If anything Bens attacks on, or criticisms of, BLM should be recasted as suggestions for improvement. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I came here because of Ben Carson. No mention of him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson can not win in the General. If Trump were to get the nominee, and pick Carson as VP, Im pretty sure the Evangelicals will vote for a TrumpCarson ticket over a ClintonSanders ticket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The overall plan is to give people a choice. That is called freedom. The ACA is not freedom, it is brought on by force by way of financial penalty. That is unconstitutional. So I say Go Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Oh, and I should mention that a coworker of mine was talking about Carson. I asked him if he thought people in prison chose to be gay. He said no. And when he found out Carson had said that, it put him right off Carson. Carsons problem is that the majority of people will begin to hear what he says. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would have to say that Chris Wallace screwed this interview up. I understood exactly what dr. ben Carson was trying to say except for the times he was interrupted by ignorance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carsons foreign policy ideas for Putin are all wrong and dangerous for America, I agree with the Trump of Gd you dont stop Putin you use him just like Gd is.

The only way to save and free the AfricanAmerican is through school choice. Doctor Carson, would you issue an executive order, once president, allowing each student to have a choice in education? Instead of choice for the AfricanAmerican, Mr. Obama chose to support the public teachers and their union. Votes are more important than humans to Democrats. Government workers already have enough job protection. They don need unions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016, Jeb needs to control his crack addict daughter.. Cucks for Growth is going really hard spending in iowa doubt it would have any affect on the donalds long term appeal, Jeb needs to quit this election isnt for low energy losers.. Carson seems like a nice guy, he would make a great running mate for Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DO NOT be fooled by kindness... Carson is smart inside an operating room but NOT the economy. He does NOT have the experience nor the knowledge to Make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. He will just be like the other politician..talk and no action. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media has hyped candidates and have downplayed Rand Paul. If any of you have been paying attention and remember, the order of hyping candidates have been somewhat like this Cruz, Bush, Walker, Fiorina, Trumpfor a long time, and now Carson. Whats next? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
we are allowing the agents of division to take sway in america, he says but he is apart of this agency, who is he fooling? ben carson is sitting up he lying, on a fox news network thats highly controlled by the wealthy elite. this whole political charade is an agent of division, you fool. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Got a lot of respect for Mr. OReilly. But the GOP Gong Show has simply went far right, and these talking points are pathetic. Mental patients like Trey Gowdy and the user car salesmen Ted Cruz, along with Ben Carson Donald Trump 2 individuals with no experience, or relevant credentials, among others, have made the GOP a partisan disaster which morphed into a train wreck reality show. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson will only be a second Obama if he gets the nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a nice man But, we need a Get in your Face Man without Fear of the Decisions The President is going to Confront. I am Convinced DONALD TRUMP has that ABILITY. His Life has been Tough Decisions and Hes Proven Himself as A Man that can make the HARD Decisions AMERICA WILL NEED. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump and Carson this is gonna be a good race! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump supporters dont have to fear Ben Carson. He agrees with Trump on most issues after all. Trump has to be patient and not react negatively to Ben Carson doing well. Trump still leads Carson in the South and North East. If Trump wins the GOP nomination, he should name Carson as his VP candidate. A TrumpCarson ticket can defeat anything the Dems put up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Look at the thumbs down for this video. Hey David Mcintosh, Trump or Carson...none of your establishment candidates will win this year. The reason RINOs like Mcintosh say that Trump is a liberal is because he wouldnt recognize a real conservative if it was standing in front of his face. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben carson, a very smart man. Look at this man, an incredible neurosurgeon! Hes intelligent, rational, and most importantly could help this country get back on the feet like the founding fathers made it to be. People just dont want to hear the truth, well, because the truth hurts sometimes. And everyone is entitled to their own beliefs but seriously, this man speaks the absolute truth in every way, shape and form. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yep, Doesnt Jeb Bush and Hillary look better now... Common look at how bad of a surgeon Ben Carson Was. Look at how trump treats woman. Look at how bad Ted Cruz has treated his counter parts in the senate. This is the message from fox news.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Dr Carson please explain exactly how a broken Washington can be fixed again and why when it is fixed after the last Obama fix the State should protect our childrens future? Surely any sane Conservative doesnt want the State protecting our childrens future. That is the responsibility of the parents. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You do know Trump isnt a politician right? Does that guy know that?.... Either Trump or Carson will be fine as president but I think what will happen is Trump will win, then Carson will be Vice President in the end. Im cool with that too. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hey guys remember back when Obama was running for election and when anyone called him out on his policies they were called racist? And that the only reason they were calling Obama out was cause they hate Blacks? How come thats not happening with Ben Carson? Why arent the people who are calling him out being called racist? Its because hes a Republican. Democrats and Liberals will call someone racist to win an argument, Republicans and Conservatives wont. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

There are plenty of people that refer to themselves as free market capitalists that dont support cutting all regulations and privatizing everything the government currently controls.

I cannot see why anyone supports Ben Carson. His website has NOTHING about immigration.....he only recently talked almost tough on borer security due to Trump making this an issue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump just has better judgment overall than any of the other candidates. I do like Carson as a second, but Id like the media to spend more time focusing on Carson, because he hasnt been scrutinized nearly as much and were seeing him just coast along in close 2nd by smiling and being friendly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is for AMNESTY and would go to war with Russia if president he said it himself! Crazy wack job! So keep voting for Carson so you can learn the MEXICAN NATIONAL ANTHEM <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The establishment will do anything to keep Hillary viable for the top office of the country. lets face the truth of this matter...She seems unremorseful regarding the death of these diplomats who we very well know where under her watch. So at best she is incompetent to do the job in my view. Not to mention blood is on her hands. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i finnally figured out why ben Carson talks so slow. conservatives dont actually listen to anything but his voice makes him sound smart, just like donalds yelling makes him a good leader. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Trump gets the nomination hell never have enough votes for president. Vote Carson in the primaries. #Voteintelligently <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson handled himself very well in such a biased line of questions that attempted to only gender strife. Based on the way he conducted himself, and properly responded to such line of questioning, I say Dr. Ben Carson for President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

JuanTrueKaiserI dont give a Fat Shit about islam and wish that Id never heard of it.

Both need the protection for different reasons. Trump needs it because many people really, really hate him and are afraid of what might happen either to them andor the country as a whole if hes elected. Ben Carson needs it because hes a very outspoken Christian. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If they are putting Biden in there they are desperate as fuck! Biden had a brain tumor removed and part of his brain along with it.. thats why he has no filter..

Im a big supporter of Ben Carson, but I gotta say that the delivery of that comment about defending yourself in the face of a gun came off pretty insensitively.

Hey Megyn. You asked Trump a question about the war on women. Now youre asking Dr Carson about being calloused and tone deaf. Why dont you ask questions without accusations and insinuations?

this will be the best option for america and the world trump as president, john kasich as vice president, rand paul as secretary of state and carson as secretary for health. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im glad Dr Carson didnt allow him to corner him into a story about Adam Eve. The left doesnt hate that he believes in Adam Eve. Theyre angry are ridiculing him because he believes in God. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When the Trump Carson ticket run in the general election the debates will be tailored to them because they have shown leadership in this action and will not play games. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How pathetic are you for talking about Mrs. Carsons looks and her name? America is in real trouble and THAT is what you are focused on? Please do us all a favor and be in a short coma during election day. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shows that Fiorina is out of touch with Americans and Rubio is not a leader he is just willing to do whatever hes told. Trump and Carson showed their leadership. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Double talk and putting the finger up in the air to see from where the wind is blowing .... that is exactly what you Mister Ben Carson are doing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sean Hannity is pathetic. Such a piece of shit. Always racebaiting, instigating racial issues. Saying black lives matter IS NOT a divisive phrase!! Its not a racist phrase, its to put emphasis on the fact that blacks have been getting killed unfairly a lot lately, its really that simple. Its the fact that blacks do get unfairly targeted and treated unfairly by law enforcement. These are simple facts. For people to try spin the phrase and try to make it negative is pathetic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is donald trump the best leader that America could have?? If he is, i already understood why america is not great as before, because this guy is a businessman a showman but no a president, america got a lack of leadership and thats a shame.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump #1, Carson #2...the GOP primary is such a big farce. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carsons religious beliefs are irrelevant to whether or not he would be a successful president. If Bill Clintons infidelities were irrelevant, sos this. Just a smoke screen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So basically, Carsons plan for winning the presidency is....fear mongering? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson said he would go to the next one, what? the next shooting?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Waiting for SJW outrage over a woman giving Carson a sandwich... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

He needs to think fast. Trump,Carson and Fiorina all overtook him.Hes just not shining. I wouldnt rule him out though....only Jeb needs to go along with Graham,Santorum and Jindal. Theyre all clowns. Oh and Huckabee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It was just a bunch of harping on each other instigated by the moderators. More questions on policy and less race baiting and pitting the candidates against each other personally. These guys are not going to be victims of the media, they will call the shots. Listen to Fiorina whine. She just regurgitates stats in her droning voice.

Wow! The first coherent interview I have seen with Mr. Carson. He makes many excellent points and even Ms. Kelly doesnt completely dismiss the fact there are issues with police with and people of color. The problem is that he is so bat sht crazy on so many other things that his message here will be lost. Not that many years ago a famous black man said much the same thing and took a lot of heat for it. Unfortunately his name can no longer be mentioned in public. Hey, Hey, Hey! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im white. Independent thinker. Conservative. America and the World need Ben Carson. He is simply....brilliant. He always THINKS before he speaks and never talks down to anyone, unlike some other candidates and career politicians. Hey Ben, have you thought about Condi Rice as a running mate? Fancy THAT on the Republican ticket a black man for POTUS and a black female as VP! I love it! Would also go for any other of the R Candidates as VP, especially Carly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
...Carson is badass. Hes taking two weeks off for book tour. He does not want to comingle campaign money with his book money. Ben Carson is a rare one and really really what we need in these complicated times. I am suspicious of Barrack Obama, hes kinda sneaky and has fooled the American people, I am suspicious of Hillary, and Bernie wants free collegepoor house to the tax payers. Watch ratings go up while on vacay from campaign. Just watch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am Brown. I share Dr. Carsons views on this stupid Black Lives Matter movement. I will vote for Ben Carson in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont sweat the polls Donald. Just continue saying what you believe. Thats what makes you number 1 in the polls. Dont fall into the trap of capitulating to the polls. Doing so would just turn you into another politician. In addition, if some of your opponents have good ideas, dont be afraid to agree with them. Even if you and Carson agree on everything, you crush all your opponents in terms of leadership skills! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its not like the GOP have any novel solutions, either. Carsons tax plan would hit a 3T in just one year, because 10% is not enough to raise all the money needed to run the government. Trumps plan would raise the deficit 1.2T per year, too. Bushs plan would raise the deficit 3.4T. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Amen Dr. Carson. Sanity is refreshing, let alone intelligence. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i couldnt agree more with Dr. Carson, a man of intellect yet humble, a man of faith and reason......i applaud his stepping up, frankly, plainly and point blank. Its refreshing for a burgeoning political leader to have these qualities.................... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben is great. Americans are stupid if they vote for anyone but Cardon. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OReilly is banking on the fact that people didnt actually watch the debate. Because ONLY people who didnt watch the debate would think Hillary won. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Whether Ben Carson wins or loses, he needs a spot near the top. He is a great speaker and I love his ideas. So many good candidates on the republican side. Would love to see them all work together.

Trump does not deserve this much publicity. He is a big fat ignorant bafoon and so is Carson. No, there were no stars on stage because they all intelligently discussed policy and the countrys future. Bernie was correct. Were sick of those damn email attacks and want to hear something of substance to help this country. Can the Republicans give us an intelligent debate? I think not. All they do is pitch out fear and hate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would rather vote for Trump because he seems like a stronger leader and isnt as theocratic. I like Carson, but I think a conflict with Russia is superfluous. I think Trump and Putin would get along and be able to make business deals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God bless Ben Carson. He is a true man of God and desires the best for this nation and its people. Ben will win in Christs name, Amen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is a joke, Jeb Bush is a joke, Marco Rubio is a joke, Ted Cruz is a joke, Ben Carson is a joke, The Republicans are a joke, Fox News is a joke. But none of this is making me laugh anymore. The games over, Bernie Sanders is going to win, and we will get the money out of politics. Then media channels like Fox News will have to earn their money the old fashioned way by actually doing real reporting and not taking bribes from the rich. We will get our democracy back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What a thoughtful man. We are fortunate to have him running for office. If you want to say someone is the one we have been waiting for it is much more rational to apply it to Dr Ben Carson than the current occupant of the white house not that you should say that about anybody, but at least saying it about him wont disqualify you from serious discussion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Carson was right <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

No, Carson is going up in republican voter polls, but those comments when measured against the general electorate would hurt him, its an area where he needs to improve should he want to have a chance at the general election. Pandering to the worst of the worst in people will only get him so far though its actually pretty far into the republican race. Cant help but think that the great Republicans of the past would be discouraged to see this is where their party ended up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I like Carson, but he simply doesnt know enough about our nation and others to be President. He now thinks that the the founders gave the press a special place in the constitution because they were supposed to be honest. wow. Actually, while they are mentioned they do not get special rights. But more to my point the press back then was even worse than it is now, and the founders knew that. Why doesnt Ben tell us exactly what special rights he would take away from the press? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I was Hillary before Benghazi ......now I can not imagine her in charge of the whole country.....sorry. Now I am CARSON . Gladly changed party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The sentences Ben carson says are surely what he means , do we need an interpreter for him. Is this the president we want , an idiot who cant express himself correctly. Dr ben carson Do you prefer pears or apples , is certainly not the serious questions he is beind asked about,, so his answers need to be clear and unambiguous. Is there any intelligent republican voters left I wonder who can make an honest assessment of this zombie like buffoon of a candidate? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The mainstream media doesnt get that the public is not as easy to manipulate anymore with the internet they can check and recheck facts and see when they are being blatantly lied to.

Mainstream Media Reporter Dr. Ben Carson! Do you prefer Apples or Pears? Ben Carson I like Apples. Mainstream Media Reporter So you hate children who hate Pears? Is this really what most media have become? Reporting more controversy off Carson,Trump,Hillary, and other candidates alike. . . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson did not say prison makes you gay. He said that being gay is a choice. He used as an example, prisoners that are straight, going into prison, on some occasions have chosen to be gay after prison.. Come on, doesnt the LWLM misquote Dr. Carson enough? Are the good guys gonna misquote him too? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson is telling his opinion and likely a lot of people agree with him. The media doesnt want to hear that, theyll wait for the missiles to start flying from a radical rogue nation like Iran or A dirty bomb from a terrorist group. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rofl, the Bolling intellect strikes again, progressives are scared of Carsons electability because he is taking the ever popular stance of blaming the Jewish Holocaust victims for being weak.

Carson never lay blame on the victims. What a desperate spin. This is a man who saved lives for a living and consoled families on a regular basis. He was answering a specific question and answered what he wouldve personally liked to have done. Why ask a direct question when one cant give a straight answer? The liberal media with their disgusting racial slurs and vulgarity are behaving like children. Their true colors are on full display. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well if he rebuilds the country like he rebuilds his businesses... hell fire all the americans and outsource the work to Mexico and china.

Looks like Ben Carson is the typical Conservative liar as his claims of being held up in Popeyes where he claimed a guy put a gun in his ribs but Ben pointed to the cashier and said thats the guy you want, because people have been checking up including asking the local police and they say nothing like this ever happened. And I find it funny how OReilly who also lied about being in a war is trying to defend other liars. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben carson is also speaking out about the white house and the mainstream media lies, thats 1 of the reasons he is popular among the liberty lovers everywhere and good for him. Donald Trump and Ben Carson are the type of people America needs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Republicans have wasted their opportunity to lead. They got nothing done at all while in control of the senate and congress. This is why they will be thrown out of office in 2016. Repubs have ONE idea,,, cut taxes for the rich and increase military and police spending. When trickle down economic, perpetual war, and mass imprisonment failed they were out of ideas. Nothing is left but a hollow shell. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone that disagrees with the points that Ben Carson makes is exactly the people hes talking about, indifferent and filled with hate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow. Youd never hear a liberal or Democrat say that. Love Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To me..personally...the perfect candidate is one with Obamas views, but Marco Rubios military mentality. ..John Kasich is surprisingly close to fitting that bill <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So according to Ben we should just run TOWARDS the man with the gun? Because that worked out so great for the other guy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Right on Dr. Ben Carson. Use that God given power within. Putin is a bully biblically speaking Russia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey are a threat to mankind as we know it. Will mankind the earth simply pass away no longer exist? Absolutely not, it will go on until the devil destroys those who favor immediate gratifications. God doesnt need us. We need him.

smh @ the fact that 174 thumb downd this video guess those are just angry people that hate foxnews logos andor the keyword ben carson pretty sure they clicked on the video and immediately hit the dislike button wo watching probably autodeclared it as racist or hate speech <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The last time I checked, GQ was a fashion magazine. I dont believe that prez. candidates need to defend themselves against random articles. Ben Carson really is not a very impressive candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons ? Is there more than one Ben Carson running for POTUS ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Black People have been historically patriotic. We have fought and died in every War in America including the first War of Independence. Even when whites thought we 13 of a human being. If you ever been to war, you know that black men died right alone with their white brotherinarms. Ben Carson makes sense about the issues at hand and just happens to be black. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Christ, is OReilly a goon. But in his case its plainly visible. With Carson its in disguise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I do not believe that Ben Carson has a very good knowledge of what is going on in the world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A coon, as I understand it to mean, is an AfricanAmerican who 1 panders to the white establishment and 2 perpetuates all of the negative stereotypes of black people. Who does this more, the gangbanging thug, which Butler excuses as just under privileged, or the doctor running for President? ... this is just venom from an angry, attentionseeking black woman hiding behind tenure. UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA needs to fire this idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson was merely talking about who he would advocate as president, not saying who should be eliminated from being able to run. Thus the questions of whether Caron is going against article 6 of the constitution are missing the pint and misleading. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People, just one look at a picture of this writer Drew Magary that wrote this about Ben Carson explains it all. He is an ugly goofy looking looser just trying to get attention. He is angry that he will never be half the man Ben Carson is. He is just trying to get attention, he gets attention by being an idiot. Hes not worth it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im not a religious scholar but Ive been told that muslims make no distinction between church and state. JFK had to make it abundantly clear in 1960, that his church would not guide his presidency. If muslims see no difference between church and state, then Dr. Carson is correct in his statement. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They probably call him The Good Black behind the scenes <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson an intellectual???? give me a break. He talks like the cult leader who pours the kool aid into tiny paper cups.

Lets elect Ben Carson or Trump and lock up all the nonwhite, nonChristian except for Jewish people in the country. Then when the whole fucking economy goes to hell, Americans can serve whoever the next empire is. The American public wants to partake in banning Islam and starting a crusade? Letem!

Thank you Dr Carson for highlighting the inferior morality of Islam, Muslims and Muslim run countries. I support your comments. I think Islam is a backwards religion and is antiscientific, antinaturaljustice, cruel and antifreedom. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
it is truly amazing how dumb Ben Carson actually is when you see his knowledge gap between one specific thingNeurosurgery and everything else in existence for which he knows almost nothing. And the way he talks he always sounds like hes either just woken up or been taking a lot of drugs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What he said was scarier than Hillarys commy gun grab. We do not need ambiguous additions to the second amendment that make it conditional upon passing the states version of mental health evaluation, which could change with regimes...I mean administrations. Carson himself said that this country should remained an armed on to prevent tyranny. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Thats okay. All of the medias attention this week has been on Ben Carson, and he has shown America what dignity looks like and gained many new supporters.

I have always been a Ted Cruz supporter. But more and more I am leaning toward Carson. The only doubt I have is how his faith will impact his decisions.

Remember Jimmy Carter gave Iran to the ayatollahs. Obama gave Iran atomic weapons! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson has more intelligence in his baby toenail than GQ writers and editors could ever strive to have. Dr. Carson is intellectually lightyears ahead of them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson lied about having a gun pointed at him in a Popeyes organization.

I like Trump, but Bens right up there. If this doesnt prove the medias a circus i dont know what will. I mean the guys a brain surgeon and look how they treat him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great couple. I think Doctor Carson would represent to America I know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Irresponsible drivers endangering others on the road. Thats sweet. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like how total RETARDS call Ben Carson A BRAIN SURGEON stupid because of his creationist beliefs, yet those same people dont know anything close to what Carson knows. and further yet 51% of scientists believe in a diety or God and a form of a the creationist theory GOOGLE IT. BUT THESE SAME RETARDS have the gull to think they can call a brain surgeon STUPID. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i like that trump and carson are starting to get along better than the others, carson was the only non trump candidate who seemed like a decent pick, so together they could be great. Both of them are not career politicians and both are prepared to defend their controversial statements. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im for Ben Carson!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson surging? Lmaooooo. Yea ok. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this just shows how extremely racist democrats are <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its the pussification of America! Carson was right, better to die fighting than be slaughtered like a Sheeple. Evil will prevail when good men do nothing! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Moodys has been right on every election since 1980 and they are predicting a Democratic landslide in 2016 based on Economic and demographic factors. no matter WHO the candidates are on either side. republicans may lose the house and Senate too. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson, its time to get your Trump on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is right on this one. Why do they want to force the gay marriage so much. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RIP Ben Carsons candidacy. Nothing of value lost. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is filthy nasty probably likes tranny to <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
At this point it seems like Trump is more powerful than the president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shy , soft spoken yea real qualities in our next Commander in Chief. Hannity literally called him out in a low down fashion ....Carson sux <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As usual Faux News gets it wrong. What he would in that situation he actually did do....Point out the kid behind the counter to the gunman and away from himself. COWARD COWARD COWARD ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
substantial numbers of people used to believe that interracial marriage is wrong. I guess Carson is okay with anything that a lot of people believe in. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I do not understand these people. As a white mother, I am proud of my responsibility for that, but I know I am not as intelligent as Ben Carson. I respect him for his accomplishments, and he makes a lot of sense. Leftist media is bashing this man when they should be listening to what this man has to say. He is intelligent enough not to have to make personal attacks, and that tells me everything I need to know about that woman. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope to do exactly what Dr Carson suggested in that situation. I wouldnt just stand there. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson and Trump are speaking the truth. It is far from being racist or ignorant. Islam is not compatible with anything but Islamic teachings and sharia law. They are loyal to one capital only, and that capital is Mecca. Islam does not accept any other faith or practice. The push for dominance has been going on for centuries and if ISIS is not eliminated the strength and power of a Caliphate will unite the cause worldwide. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson avoids every single bloody question hes asked. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is very intelligent when it comes to nero surgery...but when it comes to politics he is a complete moron...look at this fool his worried about the left and he aint even passed trump yet lmao same mistake 8 years ago there bub <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a shyster quack....end of story. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is a typical example of press bias. Carson wasnt being critical of the shooting victims he was answering a question regarding what he would have done personally. I am a big chicken and I dont support Carson in fact I support Bernie Sanders, but I do believe that it might have been better to have rushed the killer than to just allow him to shoot me. I probably wouldnt have had the nerve myself, but would have hoped otherwise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is tool by aussie murlock! Trump 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
At least Trumps is not Jewish and nobody wants that idiot Ben Carson, just one look at his photo makes me wanna vomit, I am sure Trump is gonna take the Republican Nomination with a landslide ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Lindsey Graham is another chicken hawk, fear and loathing monger... I hope every single one of these establishment scumbags gets voted out. First he attacks Carson for trying to be a man instead of a sheep. And now he is spreading more fear to make the sheep tremble. All I hear is Iran, Iran, Iran all the damned time. Iran cant do shit and if they do Israel has 300 freekin nukes they can use to wipe them out. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How about a Trump and Dr. Ben Carson Ticket????... smart and effective! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Please keep telling the truth Mr. Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is an idiot. Yes he has an advanced degree yet he believes that fairytales are not only TRUE but that they should also dictate our rules to live and govern by. This is terrifying to rational people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson does NOT believe in evolution. nuff said. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

this guy needs a redbull and a double espresso <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the man and yes its totally obvious that the media is blowing what he said out of proportion. People go watch the video about what he said and see for yourself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for President! yaaaaaaaa! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
where are the civil right activists? where is NAACP? yeah, ben carson is black and a pure black is supposed to support the democrat, the liberal, the progressive, the socialism, otherwise heshe will be disqualified. wait a second, so black people now are still properties? is that any difference from slavery? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a GENTLEMAN. GQ, so called Gentlemens Quarterly, is not! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I like Carson a lot hes got balls and he doesnt talk crap. If Trump wasnt running I would absolutely support him 100%., I would love a Trump Carson ticket, both outsiders and proud Christians and strong Americans.

Morally corrupt people dont like Dr Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is being sued because he left a sponge in a patients brain, he also says that evolution and the big bang are from the devil He is obviously not qualified to be leader. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Republicans are in their death throes. A poll that has been right on every election since 1980 says that the Democrat will win in a landslide. No matter who is running. This is based on economic factors and demographics. 2016 will be a crushing year for the Republican party. And they deserve it for having no Ideas. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Johnny Carson was a good man. God bless his soul. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
AGAIN..Ben Carson makes perfect sense. He will make a TREMENDOUS President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is black so i guess we MUST call racism on the left. If it is racist to criticize Obama because of skin color then it must also be racist to criticize Carson. The left made these rules, now they must abide by them as well you cant have it both ways. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a cock! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

absolutely no offense Dr. Carson if you ever see this. But it seems like his speech is declining since his National prayer breakfast. Or maybe he was just speaking louder? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This man saved several thousand american lives. he should have a day named after him for that reason only. BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BEN CARSON ?? HES A LUNATIC . A PSYCHO KILLA ..... SKITZO ...... INSANE TO THE MEMBRANE .... BEN IS A GENIUS YET HE IS UNSTABLE . HE IS A SICK TWISTED HYPOCRITE CHRISTIAN . HE WANTS TO EXTERMINATE ISIS . THIS IS DEEPLY DISTURBING . KILLING A MILLION MORE MUSLIMS WILL NOT SOLVE ANYTHING BUT ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE . BEN CARSON WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT SO NO WORRIES .

Its way to early from me to decide whose getting my vote but Carson is right about the black community. Communities are now hoods and a lot young blacks are proud of that. This man was raise by a single black mother that couldnt read but she made him read. Truthfully a profound lesson could be learned from Mr. Carson and his success. Black people please wake up and listen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an edcuated dumbie . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need Ben Carson for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
mr carson, keep up the good fight, althought the current president, is a black man, he has made it very obvious, that, he likes mudslims, and dislikes whites, making me, somewhat, prejudice. But you sir, have been changing my mind,you certainly seem to be, one of the few MEN, around, the likes of obama, and biden, are very small, little boys, next to you, so carry on, carrry on, and fight the good fight,and show the feeble minded, what, a real man looks like <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media is like the Jewish Pharisees trying to catch Jesus for saying the wrong things at the wrong time. Ben Carson was obviously referring to himself regarding the Oregon shooting and that obviously makes alot of sense. Especially if theres just one shooter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shes right. Carson is a coon and a bigot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

very well said Ben Carson...... very well said <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny how liberals stick up for Obama calling everyone racist but Since Carson is a black conservative he gets no backup from liberals on racist comments. Really racism only applies to conservative people says liberals. They call everyone that disagrees with Obama racist. Liberals dont stick up for Carson. Hypocrisy! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson He is very down to earth Obama is the worst President in US history! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Ben Carson doesnt want to be a coon, he needs to become a tool for liberalism. Black people should know their place and vote democrat, otherwise their blackness is forfeit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lol, the joker images if Obama the vile racist comments that have been and will continue to be posted are in now way in the same vein as the coon comment. Carson is a coon. He just doesnt care what other ppl think he has found his role in the fox spin of racism. Has there ever been a black gop governor? Had obama not been elected they woukd be parading their new pet around. Lol funny <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr Carson is a man of true integrity. ALL lives matter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is seriously stupid, I mean really stupid. He says that the Islam doctrine doesnt allow someone to separate religious views from political views so they would have to renounce that part of Islam. Im sorry Dr. Carson, exactly where does the doctrine of Christianity allow for separation of that?? And Fox News, funny how youd never interview a Democratic candidate with the same attitude...why dont you just change your name to Republican News?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Honestly what the hell has the dumbass done. She has some bullshit degree in religion. Dr. Carsons mother worked 3 jobs to make sure that her kids achieved the american dream. Dr. Ben is the best neurosurgeon in the world, because he worked hard and used the mind that God gave him. Im sick of disgusting people like Butler that are given an audience <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yup, Trump just lost me. Carson it is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am yet to see and understand how it is that Ben Carson could and should be the leader of the free world. Talk is cheap, and he has no legislative expertise nor stature as a statesman and military strategist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Carson Is Correct! I have been saying this for quite some time.

Im Sure Some Schools Will Be Implementing This Soon... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is correct. Its best to die proactivily than passivily. I disagree with Dr Carson on russia bombing the islamic terroists for us. Let russia spend their money and help us get rid of the islamic terroists and bring a stable situation to syria. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Perhaps we should wish that the brave people who stopped that flight from reaching the White house on 911 should have not done so then. Everything this government does is to further undermine real freedom and to create a nation of sheep who will never even question their governments true intentions.

Carson should have added the fact that if some of the students and teachers were armed the shooter would have been taken down before his first shot. The shooter ran his fucking mouth first giving plenty of time for an armed student or teacher to eliminate the threat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey Ben Carson..... You want to see evidence about the effects of gun control? Come to Australia where we havent had a mass shooting for nearly 20 years. Completely idiotic to not look at the evidence of where gun control has been implemented. Carson is living in a dream world if he thinks its a good idea to keep 300 million guns in circulation and expect the mass shootings wont continue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How do you not love this guy? Hes calm, moral, positive, sensible, and hes a great black role model who doesnt believe in taking other peoples stuff to achieve greatness unlike the dbagger we currently have as president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

With all due respect to Carson he will not be able to turn this country in the right direction as Trump will be able to . Also, because of the incompetence of Obama, it will be one hundred years before another black man is elected president of this country. I just can not see Carson telling people off. He is to passive. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have a huge brain and I love trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I still dont know who Im voting for, but I like what Trump and Ben Carson have to say. Neither is a career politician and I think that is exactly what we need. The liberals, and many republicans have been going in the wrong direction and we need someone like Trump or Carson to turn it around before it is too late. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Beck thinks humility is important in a President? How many humble people run for President? Why not come out as a devoted Carson supporter. Clearly hes the most humble of all candidates. There seems to be some sleazy agenda in Becks appearance here. Looks very suspicious. His critiques are shallow and nitpicky.

Trump would not accept second place, but Carson would probably appoint Donald as a special advisor, which would mean Donald could continue running his business and help in Carson with negotiations. I think a Ben CarsonRand Paul ticket is a real possibility, as Carson has a very high regard for Rand. The Republicans would love to see a CarsonCruz ticket. But who knows, still a long ways to go. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is not dumb Messiah was crucify I as a Catholic Believer he is right I dont like America any more no justice in courts slaughter Babies killing our future work force never mind morally wrong gay marriage militants persecuting faithful Catholic Christians or evangelicals they lose jobs over a gay militant sue such Marriage will always between a Man and Woman no matter what perversion goes into our society <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wow, Megyn Kelly has a surprisingly authoritativesounding voice. Bernie Sanders surprised me the same way the first time I heard him. But to sensible folk, content is king. Thats why Im voting for Carson. It will be much easier for him to see reason regarding semiautos than it would be to get us out of the mess into which Trump would stubbornly run us the moment his ego is at stake. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Solutions, solutions, solutions. I want to jump for joy every time I hear Ben Carson speak. God, please give us Ben Carson for president while there is still time to save, heal and restore our country and freedoms and may we use them more wisely in the present and future. Go Ben, Press in.

for fuck sake we need someone that will get us closer and friendlier to Russia and china and iran and not in more conflicts with them and the War keeps going , dont you see that?

I like Ben Carson and agree with him on everything Ive heard except this Why are 1 out of 80 children becoming autistic? It was 1 out of 10000 Why does the liberal paid off media Fox included constantly try to put anyone who opposes vaccines in a bad light? They try to vilify anyone who opposes vaccines When they do that you might want to find out why <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson bewilders me with his view and lack of understanding on his own constitution it secular position on religion allowing people to practice their religious faith without personal cost or persecution as long as they act within the law. He is running for president????? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
MSMs we SEE. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON FOR PRESIDENT. HE IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT GOP CANDIDATE. TRUMP WILL BE BLOWN AWAY BY DEMOCRATS WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH. HE IS SIMPLY VOLATILE UNLIKE CARSON WHO IS CALM AND HAS A SOUND MENTAL ASTUTENESS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Ben Carson should be Donald Trumps VP, The Donald would sort things out and be tough on opponents while carson smoothes out the political side of things. Great Combo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ehh they both are socialist nut jobsObama copys trump or carson will crush them Im going with trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BEN CARSON what a Guy!!!!!!!! Gp BEN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump would need to be a fool not to tap Carson or Paul for VP. I think Paul has more staying power than Carson, but I could be wrong. I like Rand Paul, but he needs to grow a pair, or just drop out and let McAfee run against Trump. I hate to say this, but seeing how good Trump is on gun rights makes me hate him less. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So why does the media work so hard to incorrectly use the amendment rights to slam Carson but also works just as hard to convince the public to give up their 2nd amendment rights?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is not a matter of diction or English. It would have been best for Mr. Carson to have acknowledged his error and changed the subject to another topic. Campaign over! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is the character, the morality of an individual that matters. Carson has made a major mistake. More to come? All religions are ONE. God is ONE. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump needs to shut his pie hole before me foot reaches down there Carsons whole life is been faith without faith there pratically wont be hope thats probably why so many people hates Trump because he criticizes too much if he sat down and read a book or ben carsons book OR WATCH THE MOVIE he would see why hes full of faith <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is my first pick but I would have absolutely no problem with Carson winning. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ben Carson, but the only major criticism I can really give him is his stance on vaccines... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

i now regret ever reading Ben Carson while in school,i have been deinspired. Ben is a total disgrace and maybe only a dummy after all.

ben Carson is no different than any other political figure hell be a puppet on the string of congress <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i like carson, but doing a study on people isnt going to help kids this generation, really is putting away the guns for sure, over here in australia we have no guns, only police, armour guards, and the army, which are not aloud to carry it at all in public...out of all things he said ive watched, its probably the only statement i dont agree with, if i were american, i would vote dr carson and trump.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson and Trump they should run together <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is an idiot. Id rather have Donald Trump over him and both of them as President will destroy this country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the one who politicizes everything. The Oregon shooting doesnt all of a sudden mean Christians are being persecuted. 9 people were gunned down and hes taking advantage of the situation.

Well in her defense... she was only a model so she could land herself a desperate old dude that she would never look twice at if he wasnt wealthy. Its not like she actually wanted to be a model but she needed the exposure to find that sugar daddy. Just think, she could be the first gold digger playing the role of first lady while her husband pretends hes a president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would love to endorse that anytime soon but I doubt that will happen. The hope is, If you beat the hell out of them, progressives will reform sooner. Yes, Carson is the correct, moderate Muslim. The real irony about Muslims is that there will emerge and clear a suicidal form of Islam not fake, like CAIR that could be consistent with the living expectations. The only thing the constitution tend to see is force, and that is what they are least likely to respect. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder if blacks will be voting for Ben Carson because of his skin color............ Who am in kidding, of course they will. Lets hope they remain as stupid as usual and blindly vote for Ben Carson for the sake of him being black, and help in our favor. Winwin situation for everybody.

The issue with the question that was asked of Ben Carson, was that if Ben Carson was to answer yes, he would be exactly what he was saying to be bad for this country. Divisive. Ben Carson cant answer that question in any other way than he did without being divisive. He is avoiding hypocrisy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If only Ben Carson had been our first black president what a different world we would be witnessing today . The man has tremendous restraint and thoughfulness. The fact that he does not resort to dirty lowhand politics sets him way apart from the mainstream candidates. Unfortunately to say that being reserved and not doing the normal bashing and playing the game, he will suffer tremendous fallout in terms of a fair treatment by the lamestream media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I dont hate the guy but I do not have good feelings about Ben Carson being US president. Unfortunately I do not have good feelings about any others either. Also this 10% tax thing. I do not know the details to it, but I hope he isnt fixated on 10% as a tax standard. Hopefully his plan is more complex and flexible than that! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is proof that perfectly fine people can be made ignorant, even stupid, by religion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would not put a Christian for a president in a muslim country because I think it does not FIT very well with the context. I think it is the same thing what Ben Carson says and also his own opinion about a muslim president in America. I dont see any discrimination or problem. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have NEVER been so complexly humiliated of my government. We were granted the honor of living in a free country UNDER GOD, but our chosen leaders have sold out His beloved Israel.

Donald Trump is a joke he wants to put a bigger fence on the border when it will costs bilions of dollars and make our debt worse besides illegal imigrants can get around the border.

The only one that is capable of being our next president is Dr Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trump is an idiot. he inherited 200 million from his daddy. in 1990 he was 5 billion in debt. how the frick do you drive a casino into the grounds like that. casinos are cash machines. then 70 banks bailed him out so they own his ass. he also got a shit ton of government bailout. then he uses the government to try and force an old widow out of her home to tear down her house and turn it into a parking lot for limos for his casino. #vote ben carson #doctors have to tell the truth <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is simply NOT going to go there!! That right there is why I am voting for this man!! He is no politician He says the same thing as Trump only says it with careful thought. Trump just blurts things out and says the same ol same ol. It gets old. People are beginning to see it. I am not a religious person. Carson just MAKES SENSE AND IS VERY TOUGH TO PERSUADE. Thats why he will do a fantastic job. Cannot be bought!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson for president! What a smart and proven man. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You guys Believe this guy of all the nerve Ben Carson Big bowling bald head ..you can bowl your way into the oval office the American people are not bowling pins.Bowling Bald head Ben Carson...,haha HAHAHA hahaha <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
she would be a great and well respected leader <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the realest nigga out there. He doesnt have biased ideologies and act like black people are perfect and are victimized for no reason. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont see whats the problem of not approving an extremist of any kind being in power. Carson should really be more clear with his words however, especially knowing how the media loves to mislead their sheeplike audience <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson for president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson you fk monkey... chimp... ugly nikker... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Evidently neither Trump nor anybody here has read any of Carsons books. He has ALWAYS been very faithdriven and an avid Christian. And what he said was absolutely true. I dont think I can picture Trump also saying that his success is not of his own doing. Im still in favor of a TrumpCarson ticket in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is so stupid....He talks more shit than trump.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson, I saw many Muslims who can separate business from faith. I believe they can separate politics from faith, too. However, I saw one person who cannot separate politics from faith, and its you. If my memory is correct, you specifically mentioned that your 10% flat tax idea is from the Bible, not from calculation. I think it is you whose religious idea cannot stand with the Constitution. If we go with 10% flat tax, the Union will perish together with the Constitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson would be a great president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yawn. This Carson fella? Boring. Talks to slow. Like your science teacher in the 7th grade. Get outta here with this crap. Vote for TRUMP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will condemn Ben Carson when someone explains what Sura 9 of the Kora Quote!!! And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them go on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. !!!!! Someone address this please, they memorize these verses from a young age. Explain IT!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Ben Carson gets nominated then the Republican will win and so the democrates are fooling people in the media and trying to deatroy Dr. Ben Carson so that democrat candidate can latter make fun of the Trumphet and win the election. Trump and Fiorina both are democrats agent and CNN is fueling them... hahaha... what a politics <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a clown! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If presidents oath on the Bible if we say God bless America in the theme song and if the dollar states in God we trust... There can be no one qualified to be the president but Dr. Ben Carson. America should not perish with out having proper conviction, faithful people and firm philosophy as a nation to stand on. Faith always matter to see the unseen and its a rudder to the future of America. God bless America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To Davis, Carson and all those other religious coocoos I know you religious nuts are really thick. Talking to you is like playing chess with a pigeon. They eventually toss the board on the floor, poop all over it and proclaim themselves the winner. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is an important issue ......not a kelly file issue........FOX get some one people want to listen to. Carson just told you the people dont buy this BS anymore. Carson is clear and doesnt need FOX. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is awesome <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Awad of CAIR was unaware he violated an Internal Revenue code by asking Dr. Ben Carson to step out of the race. Awad is with CAIR. CAIR is a civil rights organization. This organization, under the direction of Internal Revenue code isnt not allowed to meddle in such affairs and interfere with an election. AWAD fell for this and opened his mouth against Carson, HOOK LINE AND SINKER. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump could easily blow away Ben Carson with his hot steamy farts !!! Lmao !!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clarifying and modifying are not the same! One is when you over simplify your point for people too dumb to get it on their own. The other is when you change your point for people too dumb to understand the clarification. The comment standsBen Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson received 100,000 new twitter followers the day after his initial comments. Wouldnt that be a clearer message about how Dr. Carson resonates with people than what any journalist could spin? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is spot on, those who disagree are either na or they are hypocrites. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not 1 question answered. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson made no mistake u idiots. Geraldo, u are weak an a coward. u all sound like the politicians we are getting rid of!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is bulldozing a way for Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Howie I usually like you but here you are being too antiCarson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is playing the Trump card getting a lot of media attention. He is much smarter than the media gives him credit for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Do you really want this meek mild mannered man your president? The world has lost respect for us already. Putin is eating our lunch. We need someone strong, smart and firm. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes, Carson is correct about Muslims. The hope is that there will emerge a moderate form of islam that could be consistent with the constitution. I would love to see that for real not fake, like CAIR, but I doubt that will happen anytime soonThe irony is, the only thing the muslims tend to respect is force, and that is what the suicidal progressives are least likely to endorse. If you beat the living hell out of them, and make the expectations clear, they will reform sooner. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes, Ben Carson is absolutely right about the muslims. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who cares what the islam guy wants! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It seems like the Media want to pollute Ben Carson reputation but they are barking at the wrong tree lol, Ben Trust God more than anything... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump doesnt have the chance of a snowball in hell of defeating Ben Carson. Republicans have given Ben Carson a 56% favorability rating, which means Ben is their top choice. Trump looks like a grumpy old man with high blood pressure who needs another facelift. His rhetoric is hard to listen to and he doesnt really say anything, or if he does it is probably something he has borrowed from Bush or Carson. BEN CARSON IN 2016 PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Islam is a rogue cult. It should be expunged and classified as a non religion. I will not be surprised if CAIR gun down 100 Muslims in a mosque and claim that carson is responsible! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Those Muslims were honest, and Ben Carson was right <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fundamentalist rapeos have no respect for our Constitution, they place Sharia far above our laws.... Of course one of them cannot be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
arent u the media????? lol, this dont make much sense. but go ben carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is being neglected by the media from the beginning of his campaign. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson in no way violated the Constitution. He stated his opinion and that is all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is an exceptional Neurosurgeon. I think he should resume his field of expertise and leave politics to the cut throats . Hes too nice and low key for politics. Its a sleazy. business. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson doesnt need the mainstream media to win, and they should know this because the most effective form of advertising is word of mouth. So who is it really going to hurt in the end? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I could never trust a jew in position of power because jews can lie to forward the cause of Judaism. Judaism is an ideology counter to freedom and the constitution. I support Dr Carson I think he is the most aware of the dangers of Judaism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like that Dr. Carson spent his life doing things, not talking about things. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Face it folks ,,,,, Ben Carson will be the next President if you all vote for him !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson...o nobodyyyyy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
too extreme.. he is WISE .. none of these fuckers call those terrorists as Extreme... BEN CARSON MUST be the next president.. America will be a good Country if he becomes the President... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
god bless dr. ben Carson in Jesuss name word <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson 2016! Or I cant wait to see CNN and MSNBC In Burkas <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is really picking up momentum as they see how true and HONEST Mr Carson is. I pray conservatives see his is clearly the BEST option. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck everyones opinions either way religious law has no place in a secular country and Dr. Carson is free to believe anything he wants to. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has no energy, I think half the time he is falling asleep. Go Trump! If the entire establishment is against you, that must be a good thing for humankind. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why doesnt this idiot just answer the freaking question <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson states how he feels personally about the topic then a bunch of nonMuslim people get offended. I love America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You see how Carson glances at his coach before he opens his mouth. Bottom line Dr. Carson, youre prejudice and probably racist as well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everybody knows Carson is right the thing is politically you cant say theres a religious test for the presidency. A muslim would never be elected, but we do have freedom of religion in theory. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016! He will save America! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
YEAH CARSON U BE THE LEADER . CARSON FOR PRESIDENT 2016 !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder what Hillary Clintons opinion on this subject would be???? Oh thats right, democrats dont get asked gotcha questions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for 1st black president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has my vote. his track record for making things happen is outstanding. every time you see someone complaining about trump I guarantee its someone that doesnt want to make America great again. cnn and fox need to wake up and quit being slaves to the upper establishment <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When, oh when are politicians gonna understand that Islam is not just a religion?! Politics and religion are inseparable in Islam and it is therefore not defended by the Constitution!!! Shariah and Mosque are 2 sides of the same Islam coin. Ben Carson is absolutely right. Shariah and therefore Islam, is not compatible with the Constitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To all the kids watching this. This is why you need to study math, history, English, etc. Look how Dr. Carson is gentle, intelligent, and logical. I will vote for him if he is nominated. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hang in there Dr. Carson, glad to see that this is increasing your supporters because the American public GET what he meant, its the media pretending they dont, so they can drag the issue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media is like Johnny Depp in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie on Carsons explanation yes, but wheres the rum? its hilarious! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doug Schoen, get your facts straight. Ben Carson didnt say he didnt want a Muslim to be President. He said he wouldnt SUPPORT a Muslim, who wants to be President, who put Sharia Law over the U.S. Constitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Donald Trump has a great tax plan <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its Obamas fault for Ben Carsons remarks.Beyond that my answers to ANY question will be its Obamas fault...... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think the president is smart but it seems to me that the Fox press believe they are more qualified for this work. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is NOT smart, and is a mediocre Doctor. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Libtards Sheeple will vote for whomever gets the nomination from the DNC like good little progressives. All while those claiming to be Right, Conservative or Republican cant agree on shit. The MSM is helping divided the RNC and the so called Right is sucking it up like KoolAid. TRUMPCARSON 16 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson has something the other candidates don have, and is God blessing, and i pretty sure that he will be the new president of the United States of America, Trump is an asshole, he might have a lot of money and a lot of companies but he is a hater and my God is bigger tan his money and his Little god satan, God bless Dr. Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I respect Ben Carson for staying true to his beliefs. His view on not supporting a muslim president is completely fair and does not contradict the constitution in anyway. It doesnt stop them from running, which would be unconstitutional, only makes it harder for them to win. I completely support him in this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben Carson is good looking! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is not going to make it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and Carson are the only 2 choices. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont believe Ben Carson is polling that high that is bullshit fox <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i dont think it will hurt Dr Carson for the muslim comment. Islam is a dangerous ideology like communism or nazism. Prophet Mohammed was a murderer, pedophile and polygamist. This is the perfect man for muslims. Sick for us but muslims have a different moral compass. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol the founding Fathers of America, signed a Quran...That Quran, in the nations library...lol Great Carson, do ur research! lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes Quit harping on Carson and Trump. We are glad to hear about limits on Sharia. Your donors are obviously wanting Sharia. This is why we dont watch your news and support Trump and Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I LOVE how his demeanor settles her down as they speak to each other, shes all fired up to start with and then by the end of it shes all calm and respectful. Ive seen her in other interviews and shes on full throttle though the whole experience. May you always walk with God Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The last thing the world needs is a fifth term from a BUSH ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson DID NOT back pedal. What he did was set THE MEDIA STRAIGHT on what he said that you all twisted around to suit your agenda! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My choice will be Rubio because his ideas best represent America to the world though acknowledging his father s family are asylum seekers from Cuba , which is unfair disadvantage for him in political arena. Carson , Fiorina are simply incapable of doing commander in chief and moderators, and trump is liberal his current wife is Slovenian lingerie model And true ignorant of foreign affairs Can Rubio beat Bernie Chavez? Yes! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not voting for NONE of these SNAKES, Ben Carson is a UNCLE TOM NEGRO and Donald Trump is a LYING ASS SLICK CRACKER. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
is islam consistent with the constitution is a very loaded question. i dont think there was a way for him to answer this question without pissing someone off. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
im still waiting for ben carson to rebuke someone by saying trust me its not brain surgery, i should know campaign staffers need to get on that god dammit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When I have listened to Carson speak during the last 20 years I just hear a very intelligent person speaking common sense who therefore has my vote. It seemed wrong hearing democrats say you had to vote for obama or you were a racist while his mom was whiter than me. Does that mean those same democrats would be twice as racist if they do not vote for Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bravo Ben Carson !!! Now Im gonna support HIM ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I stand by Dr. Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
he makes one fucking comment about muslims then they suddenly start hating him and telling him that he will never be commander in chief...lol what a fucked up biased country. Donald trump talk and hate about immigrants and other people all the time but votes are still piling up on him. carson should be president, this one comment he made shouldnt be enough to slow his chances. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For someone who is smart enough to be a surgeon, Ben Carson sure is pretty stupid when it comes to the constitution. This is not a theocracy. Kim Davis broke the law as someone who swore under oath that she could do her job, but broke that oath. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
...carson, not a coward, he does not play. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Do people actually believe this used car salesman disguised as a preacher man? He is sooooo full of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson should have asked her if the carpet matches the drapes just to piss her off <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As Malcom X would say Ben Carson you are a House Nigga <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson will be an Establishment President, just like hes and Establishment doctor. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson supports FORCED VACCINATIONS! He will never get my vote! Forcing someone to have a needle stuck in them is NOT THE AMERICAN WAY! Not to mention all the nasty crap they put in the vaccines! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doctor Ben Carson is good negro. @Deray is a no good and homosexual. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No Muslims should be allowed to be President. Islam is explicitly incompatible with the US Constitution. Carson is 100% correct. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is right. That muslim piece of shit can go back to his toilet of a country and go fuck himself <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Terrible commentary by the Fox correspondents, excellent and genuine comment by Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
good for you Carson a man who speaks up and isnt afraid your wife is blessed Praise God for you <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The US invasion of Iraq created the conditions for them spectacular groeth if ISIS. Every US intelligence agency predicted that an invasion would increase Islamist violence. Why did Carson support the invasion? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have th agree with Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
exactly how in hell do people, even those with their head way up their ass vote GOP? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

ben carson,is another barack obama he or any one else who runs for president of any where will not get my vote,ben carson is another blood sucking tick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What the hell is wrong with Ben Carsons response to the Muslim president question? He makes perfect sense! He has to recover from that? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TrumpCarson would be a great ticket for the GOP. Carly is actually pretty in a way, but she is not really Pres. material. The rest of the field are life time politicians they will never do any of the sht they say they will, why start now?. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carsons faith guides his actions, and what Bill OReilly tried to do here was get get Dr. Carson to smear a competitor, which he refused to do. Because if he did, the Media wouldve taken it waaaay out of context. Good for you, Dr. Carson. #Carson2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the difference is in personality and THAT is what he Carson means Trump may believe he is a religious person but that is not what most people have seen him as. I concentrate on what these 2 have in common! some of u know what im talking about their STYLE and personality is utterly different but on one subject I think they are on the same page! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
....carson is f...i...n...e. Okay now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a liberal muslim democrat and Dr. Carson is 100% correct. Islam has no place in America except for a few quiet enclaves of decent law abiding people , but not any more immigrants. We are a really fucked up group us Muslims. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Megan Kelly makes me sick. But I really like Ben Carson and what he has to say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson a controlled black man. By White American. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If Americans harken to the truth and whats right, Dr Ben Carson should win 2016 by a landslide victory <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would not question Ben Carson or Bernie Sanders integrity towards #blacklivesmatter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is a democrats channel and they are favoring Trump and its about money. I hope they give time to Ben Carson to talk instead of all the stupid qurrels of Trump like the 2nd debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Really Rand Paul, he is so far down in the polls, no one cares what he says. Even if it is about Hilary. Who cant be trusted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is right. The quran is not constitutional at all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a gay atheist a Conservative Christian President is bad enough but a MUSLIM President??? Out of the question.I dont support Dr.Carson but hes right on the money on this one. It takes balls to say what one is really thinking. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
....so this is why overwhelming support is coming into the Ben Carson campaign!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Voting for Carly instead of Trump, would be like siding with someone who got FIRED on The Apprentice! Carly needs to put her face back in the potpourri sack, and Ben Carson needs to attend to his pages at the trauma center! Nothing left after that, why wait, Donald Trump is going to make a great president, I cant wait!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a liberal democrat and I agree with Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This clown proves Ben Carson is right. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Trump, but not for president. If he gets the nod, Hillary will scoop up ALL the Hispanic, Black, Gay, Muslim, Feminist, and Moderate voters, which collectively are a landslide. Trump is a typical CEO, he says and behaves as he wishes because the minions would never challenge him. The American public does not work that way, and they will certainly not forget or forgive his behavior. Fiona, Carson, or even Rubio are the only ones that have any shot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Geraldo Riveras comments dont make sense. Ben Carson doesnt support a Muslim being president. He did not say that it was illegal or against the Constitution for it to happen. I take that to mean that he wouldnt vote for a Muslim for president or endorse one. So what? Most Americans probably would not either. If a voter votes based on a candidates religion, the voter is free to do so. It has nothing to do with Carson believing in a legal litmus test. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a great man <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is right that we should discriminate on a Presidential Candidate based upon his religion. Given the racist nature of ConservativeEvangelical Christians, discriminatory attitudes towards other faiths, sex slave devotion to the Israeli PM and disloyalty to the US President, tacit support for abortion terror, love of wars and attempts to force the Bible and establish Dominion over the country, the U.S. MUST NEVER HAVE AN EVANGELICALRIGHT WING CHRISTIAN PRESIDENT AGAIN. EVER!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
with all that money WHY does he not get hair plugs?!!? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hopefully we replace John with a more competent conservative leader willing to make Obama eat his words <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Judging Mr. Carson by the content of his character, I have much respect for his accomplishments as a neurosurgeon, however his views on religion, many of his political views, and his views on evolutioncosmology are just plain nuts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP 2016! kelly can go to hell.carson is soft!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Mr Trump and Dr Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
IMO, CAIR wanting Carson to withdraw from the race because they dont like what he said, only reinforces Dr. Carsons point. Freedom of religion, and freedom of speech are both part of the first amendment. If CAIR doesnt believe in freedom of speech, theyre already proving that they couldnt separate the constitution from their beliefs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is totally unsuited for a president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im pretty sure that Ben Carson is my pick for President now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is ridiculous... looking for video with Carson, NOT this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is a bigot,still believing that sexuality is a choice,thinking that going to prison makes someone gay,,really??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why does it always go back to race? its like a trump card that always come out whenever Carson intelligence comes out. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need someone to stop illegal immigration ... bring back jobs and companies, decrease the deficit, and strengthen the military ... My money is on Rubio , Cruz, Fiorina, Christie, or Trump having the best chance at pulling it off ....... Bush and Carson dont have the leadership qualities needed IMHO ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love this mans integrity and honesty. Will be a great president. Carson Rubio great ticket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How many times does he have to say it ! If they dont subject their religious beliefs to the American way or constitution he doesnt support them ! this just proves how horrible the educational systems of the world really are .... Carson 2016 bring intelligence back to America <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Man why is this man saying such things. Its hard to believe that hes a specialist Neurosurgeon <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You only need 1 brain cell to understand what Carson was saying, why does American media always take a snippet from a conversation and turn it into a controversy? Trump was asked we have a problem with Muslims.....? No one fussed abut that question. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is right. Islam is a dangerous ideology. We need to keep muslims out for our freedom. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree if ANY RELIGION that upholds the supposed american values I dont know Im Canadian myself thank god and doesnt enforce any backward belief system can run for President. Now what I dont understand is why all these rednecks and ghetto idiot Americans think they KNOW what Islam is. They dont know shit!! But then again explaining to them is like talking to a fucken wall. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARE should go to hell. Muslims and Islam is not compatible to the US constitution. How could a Muslim be in a President of the US. Mr Carson do not withdraw, Care does not have the right to ask you to withdraw. They can go fuck themselves. You have to stand up for the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
White supremacy destroy the black! And American Indian race! The white man that goddamn devil the Bible speaks of! ben Carson is a Uncle Tom ads Negro! White supremacy is the biggest threat to world peace today! How can black come together with white supremacy always in the way! Look at the Middle East the Caucasian race turned the whole Middle East into hell! White people are parasites planet! Everywhere they go they fuck shit up! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Islam was a religion, I would not vote for Ben Carson. This said, Islam is a Satanic Cult that worship Satan. I am glad we have an America that knows that Islam should be outlawed world wide. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson doesnt want Sharia law to be part of a USA Presidents desire or religious conviction while onb office. What a bigot. Man I hate people and their religion when their religion disagrees with someone elses religion. oh crap! I am retarded! Guess Carson WAS wrong. Americans are ignorant pawns. Likely mindless hypocrites voting Hillary for the sake of ignorance and a little bit of self inflicted punishment. OR NOT! wake up and think people! CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wish carson and 90% of the commenters were dead. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why are they pronouncing divisive incorrectly over and over? Oreilly says it wrongly, and then Carson repeats it. Just curious... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I could start a religion called Fuck America I will destroy it! Then run for president ! Should Ben Carson vote for Me? Stupid fucking Media!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
129 When JFK ran for President, it was he who had to reassure America that his being Catholic would not conflict with his duty to uphold the Constitution. We laugh at this today, but at the time, it was a genuine issue. The political position of Islam is a very real issue, and it is Muslims who must square their religion with American values, which the majority of them have failed to do. As usual, the PC police have everything bassackwards. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its too bad Muslims werent this outraged after all the attacks by Muslims on innocent people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We are heading for a clash of civilizatons, agian. Islam is not compatible with the US Constitution. The Muslim horde that once attempted to overtake Europe is upon the world agian. This is what they do when they have sufficient numbers. As usual, we just put them in their place after having to reduce their numbers, once agian. Just history repeating itself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

FUCK CAIR THEY ARE AN ISLAMIC STATE FRONT LOBBY A BRANCH OF THE RADICAL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, THEY USE THE LOOPHOLES IN OUR CONSTITUTION TO PUSH THE ISLAMIC AGENDA OF OVERTHROWING THE USA. ISLAM IS NOT A RELIGION, IT IS A POLITICAL SUPER POWER LED BY THE SAUDI KINGS, THE REASON THEY WONT LET US DRILL FOR OIL OR GET IT FROM CANADA IS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO INVADE AND OVERTHROW THE USA WITH WAR BAITING AND RAISING OIL PRICES.

Donald Trump and ben carson are the only two outsiders that never ran for public office before Carly fiorina was the establishedment choice for california during her failed senate campaign running on her record of outsourcing jobs to china an laying off 3000 workers at the company and never ran a company since shes no outsider just a billionaire bootlicker <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

No career politicians! Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Any religious devotee Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu, Confucian, Taoist, etc. who believes that hisher holy text supersedes the US Constitution in the conduct of public business should not be allowed to be elected president. This particularly applies to fundamentalist Muslims because many Muslim nations are theocracies no separation between church and state, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran. So, in this regard, Dr. Carson is correct. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has common sense and Todd is a Dem. hack. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson said the dumbest thing, and and she says sweet man. 039 There goes YOUR journalistic integrity, Deidre, or whatever your name is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

WHEN I HEAR BEN CARSON SPEAK I INSTANTLY THINK.... YOU CANT FAKE BEING A BRILLIANT BRAIN SURGEON..... WE ARE NOT LISTENING TO A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER WHO READS TELEPROMPTERS . SOME TIMES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CORRECT WORD, AND THE ALMOST CORRECT WORD, IS LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIGHTNING, AND THE LIGHTNING BUG.. MARK TWAIN... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson believes in Creationism. That should be enough for people to not vote for him. But alas, people in 2015 still believe in ancient bullshit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
love how they cut off the part where Carson says even if it was a Christian running for president and they wanted to establish a theocracy that he wouldnt get behind that... ugh. media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a smart dude <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I like getting the chance to hear what everyone is thinking, I want to know. Whats the best solution. As this is some of the first information I have gotten. Trump is for Trump is all I have heard so far. Ben Carson looks like he is lost, or stoned. For me right now Cruz or Kasich appear to be honest and sincere enough. But even at the I am still waiting to see what happens, who is the one with the right stuff I can get behind. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
KUDDOS to you, Mr. Carson !!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a 7th day Adventist and we are strongly against the combination of church and state so he shouldnt if he stays true to his religion, witch he would would never combine the church and state. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kim Davis thinks her law supersedes the constitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
please after this gay lover obumer, who would even let Fiorna on this campaign. you think she knows about building a nation, please tell her to go back to the kitchen and cook up some more bull shit, and feed it to that McCain girl.

So basically at 336 Geraldo agrees with Dr. Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You people seize the occasion for an opportunity to rubbish Ben Carson. Ben Carson has said it right but you choose not to see all of it. Ben Carson said if the Muslim is not a radical Muslim and or has values not in conflict with the Constitution then he Ben Carson has absolutely any objection to the Muslim becoming President of the USA. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BEN CARSON is 100% a great candidate For Presidency For The US! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON is 100% CORRECT AND SPEAKS TRUTH! HE chose his words very wisely and will NOT allow for any form of manipulation! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God bless my brother in Christ Ben Carson, but frankly hes too nice and too intellectual to be President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We dont want sharia law. Ben Carson for prez <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson stated he is in favor of MANDATORY vaccines. Lets see... a eugenicist vs. an idiot. Dont vote. Voting makes no difference your vote has NEVER counted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
While I dont agree 100% with Dr. Ben Carson, overall he is the superior candidate in the field to change America for the better and to put the American people first. Climate changeglobal warming is the main issue where he is missing the boat, but evidently Gov. Jerry Brown has sent him a packet of scientific data in order to educate him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is definitely the lesser of two evils here. Donald Trump is just crazy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A Trump Carson team would be a sure winner in the general election. Not sure if they could get along with such contrasting personalities. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please like this great mans Facebook page. Dr. Ben Carson Facebook <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
0.9 %of America are Muslims. In no way do I want a Muslim to be president. Doctor Carson should look at Leviticus 2013. He may also think a Christian should not be president. I totally agree with what the bible says. Jerry King aka Geraldo puts the constitution ahead of the bible, that is a sin. I believe GOD made this country great, not the people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You dont tell me shit, you fucker! Trump the orangutan and Carson the chimp should both go back to Africa. Thats right, I say Trump was born in Africa. Wheres the proof otherwise? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson is absolutely RIGHT on islam. The planet needs more democratic states not islamic ones. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Liberals will take words out of context and twist it to launch their attacks on those they dont like. .............and to see FOX behaving like that as the rest of the mainstream media, is disappointing. ...........Dr. Carson said nothing wrong or untrue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So many ignorant and naive people. ..........brainwashed indoctrinated politically correct sheeples. ................happily led to the slaughter. .........mindboggeling. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has said he got his tax plans from the bible....hmmm <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have example for Carson Turkey. Muslim country that separated state and religion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No you didnt, Carson youre back tracking. For a man that I am sure has been discriminated against so much during your lifetime Carson, I would have thought you would be have had more compassion for others. Be careful what you say because once you have said them, it is hard to take it back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People like Cruz just like to pay lip service to the constitution. Ben Carson probably knows the constitution better than all those other candidates but keeps it real. You all should move to Iran and Saudi Arabia and say anything against sharia and theyll convert you all all cut your heads off. We need a president like Carson in this country. A smart and true American. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All you atheist , hell wellwishers , gays , etc ...have destroyed this country and the only thing that might get us back in good graces with the Creator is a man like Carson who obviously has the hand of the Creator on his life. And as for Russia and China being too aggressive for Carson. I believe that he will operate with gifted hands when dealing with them. HERES THE BIGGEST PROBLEM ! OUR OWN PEOPLE AND THIS NWO B.S <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One thing I would like to ask of Donald Trump, why do you always make the Illuminati sign with your hands? The Pyramid. Are you part of the Illuminati, Mr Trump? As for Carson, ask him how many Sects there are of the Islamic Faith? What about the Constitution about separation of State and Religion and he wants to be President? Have you forgotten what happened to your people Carson that you can discriminate against others the way you have been doing? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
illuminati wont let carson win cause he wont go with the NWO . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is CORRECT. A Muslim cant separate hisher beliefs under the government from the requirements of the religion therefore they would rule under a theocracy which violates the requirements to hold office under the Constitution of the United States. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what they seem to overlook is that the US constitution says the government may not institution a particular religion. On the other hand there is one particular religion that starts with I, that specifically wants to impose itself on everybody. I think Carson is right. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is a much better and indepth analysis of what Dr Carson is up against gellerbreitbartnewsbencarsonzoomstotopofmediaskilllist.html May God bless Dr Carson! <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does the GOP hate the US Constitution? Article. VI. of the United States Constitution clearly states But no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson handled that well. Now if it was Donald trump..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CAIR is a Muslim Brotherhood organization, and should be identified as such by Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Again, we hear a hypothetical question directed towards Ben Carson in an effort to make him look bad... I am never surprised by the media.. Not one of the candidates running for Presidency is Muslim... so what the hell does it matter!? Screw the media and these people attacking Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hey Democrats!... is Carson a racist too?? ahah <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is right...particularly about the requirement he stated having renounced Sharia Law. The law that constitutes ISIS raping and slaughtering people. Carson stated his own personal opinion, which he is entitled to under the 1st Amendment. He did not say that the Constitution bans Muslims from Higher Officer. Get over yourselves people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Are these guys seriously discussing politicians ability to lie? Ted Cruise is trained in lying Ben Carson is just a doctor he should get media training to lie better They are giving advice how to dodge questions thereby not disclosing your real views. Man this is a fucking joke. I dont wanna vote for the person who tells me what I want to her. I want someone who believes in what I believe. But I still prefer someone honest I disagree with than a slimy lair like Ted Cruise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz and Graham are wrong. No muslim should be allowed to be president or of any other political position in this nation. Islam is a totalitarian Satanic religious cult just as National Socialism was in Germany. However, Obama is a muslim by his own admission and is president because of his deceptions.Therefore, he should be removed from that office. Thank you Mr. Carson for telling the TRUTH. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Carson. This is a Christian majority nation, so we need a president to reflect the fundamental values of the majority. Do you think a Muslim nation would want a Christian president to represent and guide them? Its interesting how the media so quickly defends against religious discrimination but if Carson was asked the same question about Satanism I dont think we would be behaving this debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How ironic is it that a black man is asserting that a muslim should not be allowed to be president. Does he not realize the same thing was said about his own people. How easily do people forget. As a black man, watching this was cringe worthy. Malcom, and Dr. King must be rolling in their graves. What a disgrace! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I can see the conscience police are out in full force today. Dr Ben Carson was only stating his belief. Whats amazing about the American electorate, they dont want to be told the truth, they prefer a politician to bait and switch them, tell them one thing before they get elected and then once they are elected to go back on that statement. I admire the doctor for standing strong and refusing to tell a lie or to violate his conscience just to get elected. Dr. Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

There is no such thing as Christian persecution in this country... Christians are simply not allowed to use the government to force their beliefs on other people..

Ben is right but he is also wrong because discrimination will still exist. That being said Carson himself even said if you have a degree its a CHANCE. that chance can easily be taken away by again discrimination. That is the Republican way. Whereas Democrats keep discrimination going by providing assistance to keep blacks in poverty. Either way it goes, black people need to get their shit together and build our own way of life and ignore this ignorant two party system. End of story. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets be clear, Carson never said to ban a Muslim, he said he doesnt support a Muslim president. Second, shariah law is a real and imminent threat that and does not follow American morals or the constitution. Go Carson!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i only vote if carson or trump is republican nominee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People finally learned that Ben Carson is a religious nut job. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has proven success, doctor carson has proven success, all the governors including Bush have proven success, and this woman has nothing but a totally failure of records from the 2 companies she lead. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the end of Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All Trump has to do is just what hes been doing which got him here in the first place. Just being honest about his views. Thats all the voters really want. Honesty and a take charge leadership quality. And Donald has shown hes about as take charge and honest with his views as they come in this race. And good for him for sticking up for Carson. He would make a good VP to Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I could never trust a muslim in position of power because muslims can lie to forward the cause of Islam. Islam is an ideology counter to freedom and the constitution. I support Dr Carson I think he is the most aware of the dangers of Islam. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson Should Have Been The First Black President Megan I Am More Than Sure That All You White People Talk And Make Stupid Ass Remarks Because You Do Not Know What Its Like Not To Have And You The Media Are Pushing This Bullshit Agenda Taking The Father Out Of All Families Pushing All The Gay And Woman Power Bullshit!!! #IJS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well done, Dr. Carson. You have my respect <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is blowing it with too much religion.....Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A islamic saying for a republican candidate to get out of the race? LOL fuck no! Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A gotcha question by NBCs Chuck Todd on Dr. Carson. No question Muslims are despised and hated in America <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am really starting to love this man. He would make a great president. So many good candidates this time, Carson, Cruz, hukabee , I admire him for speaking the truth that everyone else is afraid to say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Democrats Freak out about Carson basing some of his ideas off of ideas in the bible Democrats Freak out over Carson saying that a muslims should not become a president because they will base their laws on their religious laws So democrats support Sharia law, but oppose biblical law? Just sayin <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We have to take this country back!!!!!!!!Obama has ruined it. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone that reads the Quran will realize Carson is correct <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yep first the Muslims tell Germany to give up their Oktoberfest and now the Muslims here are saying Ben Carson should not run for President for expressing that he would not support a Muslim for President.. He is speaking for those of us that are tired of being threatened by Muslims and coerced to make special way for them at every turn. We refuse Sharia period. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON SAID WHAT MANY PEOPLE THINK. And he is right. Islam is intolerant to other religions, and its goal is to convert the world to the Islamic faith by force. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DR. CARSON IS A GOOD MAN AND CAN BE A GREAT LEADER, BUT HE SHOULD BE IN POSITION DURING COMFORT TIME, NOT IN THIS CRITICAL PERIOD AFTER 7 YEARS FROM THOSE MOPS INTENSE DAMAGED INTO THIS COUNTRY. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump tickles our ears but I sure dont like his attacks on peoples looks and his arrogance! His head is too big to fit through a normal door. He demeans women. Im ashamed of anyone voting for him! Too easily swayed by entertainment value! Carson gets my vote! And I have a lot of respect for Carly! But Im even sadder that Scott Walker is not in the race! He can take the HEAT! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey guys, I liked Trump at first, but now I am certain that no Republican has a chance at winning. They all look like clowns. and it doesnt matter what I think, most of the nation is laughing at the candidates. The only Republican who looks sane is Fiorina, but she has a horrendous track record. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Constitution is based on JudeoChristian values that are being destroyed to destroy it! Muslims are a nation unto themselves. They do not put the Constitution over their faith. They do not support the CONSTITUTION of ANY COUNTRY when they grow in numbers! FACT...not fiction! They want Sharia...and that is what they fight for! Not the Constitution! Dont let them in AMerica...too late...the President IS a MUSLIM! oops! Peace? Not at all! He is all about destroying the USA and ISRAEL! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
amercan values? yea let get some, at the same time lets get some balls, Go Carson, set people straight Ill say it for you Muslims, the Quran, islam is more full of shit than any other religion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Christie, Paul, Fiorina, Huckabee, Carson, Cruz, Rubio, Jindal, Graham, Santorum, Bush are all next... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great Video! Im sick of this PC nonsense as well. It is time for a Non to be president. NonPoliticians 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This Ben Carson believes in the white god, imposed on them by the white man. This black slave have become the slave of a white god , with blue eyes, blond hair and tall.Earlier the white man enslaved..... slave likedefeated naturelike Ben Carson, now they have enslaved their soul. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Again, the media blows a simple opinion by Mr. Carson completely out of proportion. In addition, the sound bites edits out the context as to WHY he said what he said. Why is it a top story? Ratings. Pure simple. However, the blonde lady is definitely offering a clearer understanding of Carsons remarks than that guy named Rivera, who thrives on fallacies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These people are morons. He didnt say the constitution doesnt allow it. He meant , he feels a Muslim wouldnt uphold the values of the constitution. Holy crap!!!! These people are idiots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No wonder the country is so messed up. Its like a creepy Stephen king novel. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz, I read your book. I have to admit, I skipped most of itI didnt buy it to get a family biography. I was interested in your Senate experience. I like you as a Senator. I dont think you would make a good president. I simply cannot stomach another politician. Im voting for a real human beingBen Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the state will protect your right to exercise your belief not to sponsor your belief. Ben Carson is so far out of touch, its no wonder how his appeals to his base. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what can i say. this carson guy is clearly a hundred times smarter than Trump for sure. I will be fine voting for him. Although he needs to pick up some energy during speeches. too soft speaking falling alseep shit doc <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The people who attack Carson are the same people who told us we are going to bring democracy to Iraq forgetting that Muslims want Sharia Law not democracy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is everyone saying what the candidates SHOULD say? The whole reason why Trump and Carson are doing so well is because they are NOT the typical blow it up your ass seasoned politicians. They are real Americans who say what they think instead of having people write their speeches for them or desperately filtering their words to be the most politically correct meaning FAKE!? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The religious test had to do with Christians not Muslims. The Muslims are using our ignorance against us. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a dumb uncle Tom Coon.. I wonder his views on Malcom X, who was a Black Muslim that fought for civil rights for him to run for President.. this Guy is catering to a Racist Conservative base that would not support a black man running for office like 50 years ago.. its sad when the oppressed oppress the oppressed . his comments were offensive to African Americans that are Muslims or did he just thought think that only people from the Middle East were Muslims <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id vote for Carson in a second. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
GREAT! Ben Carson should become president and revise article 6 of the constitution to outlaw muhammadist sharia law. Muhammadist do what their founder Muhammad did thousands of years ago,,, rape, murder, steal, lie,, and act like victims so leftist fools will protect them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson spoke out and now he is asked to drop out, cmon Mr. Cruz we dont have to bow down to muslins it aint muslins who are attacked it is the Christians.All this religion,who is right or wrong,who is corrupt who is not corrupt.All this is, is just one big cluster fuck.Go Donald Go!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I happen to believe that God faith does play a big role in Ben Carson life and thats apparent when he talks and his actions, hes extremely likable . Ben is very , very smart and he makes me want to support him for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont think Trump was answering specifically about Carson statement. They took that part of an interview he had given, which kind of related to the event where the guy asked him about the Muslim people matter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson answers a question honestly! But everyone is focused on what he said. Not how he said it. PC POLICE must be stopped 2016. Is there a Doctor in the House?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson is right, and I love Trump but Starnes is trippin.. the US was founded CONTRARY to JudeoChristian values. Jesus is not mentioned in the Constitution , the Constitution is secular and written by Deists wanting to get away from a Christian Theocracy back in England. They didnt like Theocracy nor Monarchy.. the values of the US Constitution are religiously neutral.. it basically just says your rights came from God but no one knows who God is so lets get on with shit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Literally no one would vote for a Muslim president, are you fucking stupid? Carson basically said what most of us already think. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is RIGHT. Shariah politicalReligious Law is Totalitarian rule of the people. The Constitution is rule of the Government NOT the people. Muslims eat, drink crap shariah Law, thus a Muslim would ONLY make a good antiAmerican totalitarian pen phone dictator, NOT a good bipartisan Constitutional president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
thank god. Shorten the goddamn debate to Trump, Carson and Fiorina and keep it that way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its the funny the Trump idiots dont see this. The hosts are trying to give him a rationale way out to defend this bigotry by saying this guy was a plant. But instead Trump readily admits that no his supporters are just bigoted and stupid. You can see the reaction of the hosts on 553. They cant believe what they are hearing and quickly have to change the subject. Trump supporters you are awesome you are a blessing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does anyone actually support this loser??? No one with a brain. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go TrumpCarsonCruz! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What does it matter? Carson will never be president, so whatever he says or does is meaningless. Ditto for the rest of the TEAliban GOP who are running. Even Republicans are jumping ships over to Bernie Sanders. Look for Republicans for Bernie on Facebook <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson was really wrong for that, he out of all people should understand the difference in religions for Muslims. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I believe that Mr. Carson said it perfectly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Dr Carson. King Abdullah of Jordans country hates the USA the most. The Islamic ideology does run counter to freedom and the Consititution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the one with the loose cannon answers....remember the one about gays in the prisons......way to religious for me.Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson gives honest answers, and is not a politician. Too many low information voters wont be able to get past that They want political hacks with talking pointsrehearsed answers. And that is what politicians will give them. That is the fundamental weakness of democracy. The best of the very flawed forms of government, and one that has a limited lifespan. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Mr. Carson .......CNN recently called people who would not welcome a Muslim American President Racist... CNN is a bunch of idiots!!!! Muslim President ? Never!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I love Dr. Carson, and think his views are spot on. Now the BUT factor Why are Dr. Carsons views breaking news, in the sense of immediate, earth shattering info? Fox, and others will attribute breaking wind to breaking news. North Korea firing a nuke or some other such calamity is breaking news to me. If Chicken Littles sky is constantly falling, when should we really be concerned? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
More Trump bashing and baiting from Megyn Kelly. Dr. Carson is so respectable!!! He didnt take the bait!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio was very impressive in the 2nd debate. People are talking about Fiorina because she grilled on Trump, but Rubio made strong points of his own merit and elevated above the nitpicking Fiorina indulged in. He put himself on the radar big time. Trump vs. Rubio, I dont think Fiorina has a chance and I dont think Carson has the leadership ability to have a real chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sorry but Ben Carson doesnt have the fire in his belly to lead America out of the mess Obama got us into. There is a time for peace and a time for war., how many cheeks does America have? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BEN CARSON IS ALSO AN AMERICAN ROBIN HOOD! He has accomplished so much in his life already, that he could just be retiring and enjoying a well deserved peaceful life with his family and friends, and yet he decided to take all these race challenges because HE TRULY BELIEVE in helping us, AMERICANS, and the world. I ADMIRE YOU BEN CARSON! We need you Ben Carson. I am voting for you! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fake ! Trump is leading and will win, because he is the only real candidate ! Who could take seriously a poll where Ben Carson, a guy that seems to be sleeping every time he talks and has no real knowledge of anything or personality, grant him 10% ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fiorina is the establishments flavor of the week. Carson was last week. All in a coordinated effort to try to slow Trumps rise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I would be happy with trump or Carson but I think trump needs to get. bit more serious with his plans then again. he has a long while <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The main problem with Carson is that he is a member of the SDA Seventh Day Adventist cult that is headed by the false prophet Ellen G. White. Carson can say he has faith in God, but once the SDA doctrine is examined against the bible, its obvious that Ellen White teaches a false god, and a false christ that has nothing to do with the Jesus Christ taught in the bible. All SDA members are highly deceived by Ellen White that includes Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson looks and acts like he smokes a shit load of weed on a daily basis. Thats why hes so soft spoken and blinks like a stoned panda bear every 3 seconds because hes trying not to pass out from the chronic! LOL!!! Otherwise, he really has no message and nothing to say. No wonder even Jeb Bush looks like the energizer bunny in comparison. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carly, there is no fetus on a table in that video... unless youve been watching abortion videos regularly. Trump did well. I loved both his handshakes with Jeb and Carson.

Fox violated its Three Bimbo Rule, change title of the show to Outbimbod Trump is attacking people because HES BEING ATTACKED FIRST?

trump looked like he was about indulge into his own ass and eat his own shit.. he got fucked by everybody at the debate and still he has the nerve to laugh about it..his wife and daughters should get raped by ben carson and mike huckabee just to teach donald dump a lesson.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Immigration Well done Trump and Ben Carson! Carson says they have a GOOD fence in Yuma, Arizona. He says it works! 2 fences with a road in the middle. Hmm... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We learned that Trump does not know the difference between anecdote and evidence when it comes to science. How people still like him after his autismvaccine bit is beyond me. How Carson did not take the golden opportunity to blow him into a million pieces at that moment is also beyond me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Every time he starts to speak, Ben Carson seems to fall asleep. Nice guy however. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I really am impress with Dr. Carson, Rubio, and Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow and the woman Vet chooses a Bush. Tired of the Bush family ideology. Fiorina being able to mouth statistics is not a help. Trump and Carson or Cruz still looks the best. Primarily because Trump seems free of the need to tow the party line. He is also able to put together a team to solve problems and so is Carson Carson may be the only person to not be bulldozed by Trump and be able to work with him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It always seems like Carson takes in some Xanax before he speaks.. way too calm in my opinion. He is a joke,not because he is a bad guy or anything, but because he has no political experience.. Bottom line, you have to have experience. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson always talks as if he is on Xanax. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only reason Ben Carson didnt do very well is because the format of the debate encouraged interruptions and rudeness... none of which is in Ben Carsons character. I think CNN did a terrible job with the format and moderation in this 2nd debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kellys face when Carson nswers says it all! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
to call this a debate is a stretch,it looked like a game show,TRUMP and CARSON where the only two that did not look like a silck mouth politician. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Ben Carsons tithe idea for the TAX proposal. Love the idea of living by the bible. As history has proven a nation under the ideas of the bible is a nation that is strong and wealthy. A nation with out the bible... look around. Sure China is doing good, but if youre a second or third child you arent aloud to breathe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

the only people on that stage that did not look like a politician ,where TRUMP and CARSON. BOTTOM LINE! fox is now pushing fiorina,she is and will be owned by the boys.TRUMP OWNS TRUMP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Jeb Bush....Get out of the way !!!! DONALD TRUMP in 2016 !!!! Ben Carson for VP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When your on the TOP of the polls the dummies aim at the leader, instead of the issues. Ben Carson is vary smart man I hope Trump picks him as a VP and put Fiorina as Secretary of State. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON ONE OF THE LOWEST SCORE ON THE CNN DEBATE! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz, Carson, Rubio, and Fiorina all had amazing debates, hell even Christie. I think they are the top 5 that have a shot at actually being competent as potus. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youre a joke Orielly .... Trump was attacked again left right and centre Its obvious FOX backs the establishment <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben! we really dont need you to be philosophical and spiritual!! we need you to be Strong and deal with the issues that Truly are on the minds of todays Americans Get in There!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has impressed me. He seems calm under pressure wonder how much of that comes from being a Neurosurgeon humble and intelligent. I think he would be a pretty good President. I would be alright with Carson,Cruz or Jindal. I also like Huckabee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox defends Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio all the establishment , proamnesty, RINO traitors. Then Fox attacks all the principled outsiders, Trump, Carson this surprised me because I thought Carson did well and Im a Trump fan so it exposes Krauthammer for his phony establishment views, and a backhanded compliment to Rand, but then goes on to compliment Christies pathetic night. Christie did NOT look good... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We dont need a Scott Walker in the White House ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i cannot believe FOX is trying to spin that debate into anything other than a crazy sideshow of freaks.. questions like who would you put on the 20 bill? bush said Margaret Thatcher, a brit, and most everyone else said their Wife LOL and what would your secret agent codename be? another excellent round of comedy but still a stupid question.. What about the TPP? what about Iran Contra while were kissing Reagans ass and killing Obama about the iran deal???? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a Democrat, if I were to choose any of the Republican candidates I would choose Kasich. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think this short format is better for Carson any longer and I get bored with him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Could one sane person actually see Dr. Carson as a presidential nominee? I think hes not well spoken, and i could not see him negotiating a Iran redeal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These politicians have taken debate class and can talk the good talk but they all have been part of the problem not the solution because all they can do is debate. Theyve been in congress and everything has gotten worse.We need people who can get it done not argue like freakin lawyers who can talk their way into being president. Trump or Carson. They are our best bet. Also shame on CNN they were totally trying to get them to fight each other rather than get to serious question. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is such a troll. Hes in it to split the vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The faster we get this down to Trump Fiorina, Carson the better <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree the format was unfortunate. Poor Carson looked appauled and its not his thing to get down in the mud, he has too much class, so this was unlucky for him. I was especially impressed with Fiorina and I thought Rubio was studied and composed. Christy did not dissapoint, I expected him to lean in and he did. The first debate hosted by Fox was much better. Mr Krauthammers analysis was exactly what I came away with as well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump won! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What did you think of Trump? I thought he didnt do well in the first debate says Krauthammer, which of course means hes clueless because after the first debate Trump soared. Nothing got lost in the shuffle as Kraut said. People heard Trumps answers and more and more began liking him. More and more republicans are realizing that its best to vote for a nonpolitician. So Trump, Carson and Fiorini will be the top 3 and 2 of them will comprise the ticket <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The fact that theres a possibility the debate will last for at least 3 hours gives Ben Carson a huge advantage. Hes done surgeries 1215 hours, plus the level of stress that comes with the surgery is huge. 3 hours debating against fellow candidates is going to be a walk in the park for him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has my vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is my pick to take the Republican Party. Im a Democrat <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson talks like a monotone zombie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Will Rand Paul get bitchslapped, again? Will Cristie or Trump put the traitor in his place? Will Carson stay awake? And, will Carly manage to sell HP tanking as a business credential to vote for? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Watching these campaigns by many if I can even call them that really shows me just how negative society in the media has become. Most at Fox News are SO negative and always wrong aswell. All at CNN are NEGATIVE. The others in the campaigne are negative.Trump is the only positive and creative thinker in the bunch. Yet hes being attacked daily by median and the jokes like Ben Carson, scott walker, rand paul daily. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson reminds me of Cleveland Brown <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Oh their stirred alright Todd! Fact is they are scared shitless that people Love Trump! The puppet masters are pulling out their hair trying at every angle imaginable to bring Trump down. Fake polls with Carson, lying about him surging, etc.. when in FACT Trump IS SURGING! More and more everyday! The REALITY IS TRUMP IS WINNING EVERYWHERE! Give up lying ass news media! DONALD TRUMP NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 2016! HE GETS THINGS DONE! TRUMP 2026! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its a good thing Carson his standing his ground on his religious faith because the media wants him to say something negative about trump and if he does, we will be hearing a whole lot of he not as holy as he claims I think Carson understands this and thats why he is still so composed. Carson for president 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey, you have one for almost 8 years already, and you know where you are now. Will you have another one ?From what I heard, the good doctor hit the patient first !. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carsons pro mandated vaccine stance and antiautomatic weapons in large cities, so only the criminals will have them, make Ben a HELL NO for me <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson does not need any kind of strategy. Hes a fucking NIGGER and this alone will win him the election. America worships the black man Obama is proof . The only way Carson will lose is if he runs against another nigger. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well if the media the republican party lie all the time about the numbers I would get pissed off too. Carson is a good man but way way to weak to be going up against people like ISIS or North Koreas Kim IL Dung. He will be just like Obama think he can talk these people into being nice guys, sorry that attitude is going to get a lot of people killed. They only understand power force. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like the idea of Ben Carson as president, but I disagree about the black lives matter movement. I do agree that people on all sides can use it as a distraction. He was right about education. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate to admit it, but Charles is right. Trump hates to lose. We shall see. The summer of Trump is over. Will it be the Fall of Trump now. I can see The Trump as President though, but not Dr Carson. Carson is smart, nice, but the wicked world needs a Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All Lives Matter!!! Thank You Ben Carson,he just may have my VOTE!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If all the candidates attack Trump tomorrow, it will backfire against them <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson said he shares the same vision for America as Sharpton. Thinks The World is 6000 years old and supports mandatory vaccinations. Good luck winning with that platform. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look at the do as we tell you puppet Kelly crooning FALSLEY over Carson. The anti Trump media finally has someone so she can use him to go after Trump since Trump showed the world what a bimbo she is along with her anti Trump media controllers!

These polls are Bullshit! 327 people! HA HA! Proof that the news media is using Fake polls against Trump because they cannot stand him. Do not believe FOX is for him, they pretend to be as the set up for the knife in the back! In reality Carson is no where near Trump in Overall National Ratings. Trump is near 54% to Carsons 18% and that is the Real National numbers! Like Trump says the news media are dishonest!

Trumps supporters know hes not a polished debater, and they seem fine with that. Trump and Carson have the most to lose because theyre the frontrunners, by a big margin, and they have the least political experience. It will be interesting to see if the debate has any impact on their poll numbers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The poll is rigged in Carsons favor. In the survey they asked Who is the first candidate you will vote for The second question is Who is the second candidate that you would vote for Ben Carson collects more votes because they combined the two question and then gave it to Carson, but Donald Voters dont get this advantage because they are usually split on second candidates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DR BEN CARSON FOR A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 2016..united we stand <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
None of this matters. Its way too early. The bluebloods will attack both Carson and Trump while talking up Jeb Bush. It will work. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr. Carson is a breath of fresh air. His great ideas comes with reasonable solutions. Both he and Trump will have the opportunity to outline further details on a host of issues during their next debate. America will be listening...and deciding. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson 2032 because thats how long it will take him to catch up with the others. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is being ignored because he isnt saying anything people want to hear or anything new. He copies Trump, gives religious reasons for governance, wants mandatory vaccinations, will take donor money, says he shares the same vision as Democrats. Once the media picks Carson apart, the base will no longer back him, thats why the media is ignoring. It is for Carsons own good. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You hope Trump is not going to be president. He is looking better and better and so is Carson. You guys are going to lose your special interest money. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They think Carson is going to hide from Trump, good idea, but it wont help Carson to be fearful the entire campaign. Carson has already shown his weakness by attacking peoples religious convictions which reminds me of a person that has never been tough, so they dont know how to be. We need a tough President, not a push over. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump getting bashed by special interests, why does anyone think people will care what a bunch of establishment billionaires think of Trump. They can throw all their money behind Carson and still lose, good for media advertisers, bad for antiamerican billionaires. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To win, you need to stay in the spotlight, especially that last month. Has Carson been tested as much as Trump, in terms of STAYING POWER? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, big change in GOP! Six months ago, they ostracized Christie bc he hugged a black president, but now Republicans are flocking to Ben Carson bc hes not a rich, obnoxious white man.

Ben Carson used aborted babies in his research. A christian would not have used aborted babies or conducted researh that called for the use of aborted babies. He is lying about his faith. If he is conducting medical research then he can be considered a scientist. Almost all scientists are atheists. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This isnt Carsons full immigration plan. He wants to put Military, Border agents etc.. on the border. Also he said Immigrants need to pay all back taxes, sign up as guest workers, if they have broken the law, other than being here, they wouldnt be eligible to stay. They would not be elgible for any welfare programs. Thats the main part I can remember. It is not feasible or legal to ship 11 million immigrants out of here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wouldnt leave the running of the country to an idiot who takes anything upon faitha claim without any evidence, that is the last thing a competent leader should have. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

No fox news he did not fire back, but I still like Ben Carson better as the nominee only because he is logical and uses reasoning. There is the catch 22 because people do not like subtleness. They like kicking and screaming which is what the Donald is known for. I still agree a lot what with Donald is saying, but I just prefer Ben Carson more. Please reply to me who you guys prefer and why. Donald is better in a debate, but lacks the explanation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
About time some one said it the way it is. I see so many beautiful children out there whose families are trapped in the government handout mire. Such promise in each face, yet told by the system that they cant do anything for themselves. My heart breaks for them. Dr. Carson, even if you dont make it all the way, I sure hope your message gets heard by these children and their families. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is an incredible human being, he is TRULY conservative. Donald Trump is a clever opportunist, these hard line republicans are getting fooled badly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Can you say AGENDA??? They cut the video off to attempt to stir up more strife. Dr. Carson is classy and has no need to hurl insults in order to communicate has no need to prove himself. VERY disappointed by all the irresponsible media reporting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have tried to get into Carson but I always end up turning him off because he is so boring. He might make a good VP though. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lets get this guy into the Whitehouse.Its time to push Trump out of here..Carson is True. Im walking 50miles on Oct 11,2015 From 495DePa line to Kent County De.Who is with me.if you cant walk the whole way.im gonna anyway. Lets get the real deal in the Whitehouse..let Dr carson Operate on this country the right way and get us walking again.. <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You guys should know better. Politicians say almost anything to get elected and you know the president doesnt run squat. Our government does whatever big business tells them to do. Government and business in this country are one in the same. How do you think businesses were able to use our hard earned tax dollars to bail out of trouble? Why is the US in the Middle East? There is no other reason other than to help business. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope to see Dr. Carson give more thought on this issue and consider how to both communicate his solution better, and better address Megyn Kellys question of how to handle the complex diversity of religious thought and conscience that exists in this nation I believe that is a valid question that Carson isnt addressing thoroughly enough. That being said, his response to Democrat racism was excellent and right on the nose! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson the human sleep aid <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stale News Megan Kelly a lot of people are talking about this for a long time, this your long shot to boost up the ranks for Dr Ben Carson against Donald Trump, but tis not going to work!! You just gave Donald Trump his trump card to play with!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bigotry from a black man who would have been sitting in the back of the bus 50 years ago??? Carson is an asshole. I noticed he didnt like talking about a Muslim who wishes to deny rights to Christians . How about an atheist who wishes to deny rights to religious people? A Catholic to divorced people? Carson you asshole, no ones forcing same sex marriage on someone who isnt gay , but you ARE forcing your religion on gay people and denying their rights under the LAW. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
its gonna be trumpcarson ticket book it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Guest worker status? Fuck no. Carson lost my vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson needs to stay a doctor. Guy hasnt ran a business. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well Dr Ben Carson could be the one. America is sick at the moment and he is a doctor. So he might just be the one to heal it. Im going to call Mr Carson. Doctor America.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OReilly needs to know when to shut up and let Dr. Carson speak. He kept interrupting him when he clearly does not want to go there. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a great doctors but not a great politically <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Black Lives Matter, and I commend Dr. Carson for his take. Oh and sidenote Notice a White woman is reporting this news, and not a Black one. Just something I noticed... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is right again at least Carson can admit it......Too much religion from Carson for me......Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Dr. Carson was the first Black President, i strongly believe this country would be 20 years further instead of 20 years backwards. wasnt these race issue a thing that started dieing out in the 90s?? why is it being brought back up? Carson for 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump would embass this country if we put him in office. He isnt even close to being the dignified gentleman that Carson is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a man who will represent everybody in this country, not just himself! Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn you carson for making me want to vote for you <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This country definitely needs a good doctor whose hands and mind are guided by Infinite Wisdom. Good doctors are problem solvers, they want to make things better. Long live Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson says he is against stem cell research...But OOO when he is paid he will break his moral rules and do stem cell research. I DONT WANT ANOTHER SELL OUT AS MY PRESIDENT!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson didnt even know the difference between the Federal Reserve and Treasury this guy is clueless and WAYYYY OUT OF HIS LEAGUE when it comes to politics....Running for President no way haha <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is a member of my christian denomination. We KNOW about his Christian faith. He is not using it in any way to get ahead in the race, he is telling the truth about his faith. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Discussing any republican candidate is a moot point, American voters are the most progressive and educated in our history. Republicans dont have a chance in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Dr. Carson. but honestly HOW can you be such a well educated successful neurosurgeon. And you dont believe in evolution or you think homosexuality is a choice? Come on..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
B for BenCarson, B for BernieSanders. Both are very likable guys in their own ways. Mr Carson hits calmly but still hits very hard. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr Carson is right i grew up in the ghetto on welfare and hated didnt have food to eat second clothing but i still loved my mother but school and God saved me i made 80,000 last year 0 dependency on that Godless government i love my job that racists demoncrat party is a joke along with sharpton,Cornell west,jesse Jackson,tavis smiley <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is too weak!! Ill vote for Trump!!! Make America great again!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson and Kim Davis are the only 2 people with the backbone to stand up for what they believe in. You dont have to agree with their beliefs, but their right of freedom of beliefs and convictions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont agree with Dr. Carson with many things, but he hit the nail on the head with this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald had my support, but now he doesnt. He is a complete jack ass. Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for President!!! God bless America and Ben Carson pray that he wins the election <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>
Carson wants forced vaccinations on every man, woman, and child in America. That makes him my enemy and nothing else he says would make me vote for him. He is right about this blatantly racist State sponsored hate group but nothing can make up for the fact that he wants to inject me with poison against my will. He will have to kill me first. He is my enemy and I will stick that needle in his eye if he comes for me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is to mature for politics or politics is not mature enough for Carson. Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson nice guy but just too slow a thinker to be President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well he never said trump was without faith, he merely said that he hasnt seen trump acknowledge his publicly. Yes that may come across as an attack, but at least he acknowledged he made a mistake and is truly sorry for bringing it up. I mean this man has apologized in the past for making some controversial statements before anyone called him out for them. That right there is honesty and responsibility and leadership. This man is the most worthy candidate in both fields. Carson 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This Carson guy sound really intelligent. Kinda like him. What was his job in the past? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is going to crash. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I was initially proTrump and still am when it comes to economic development, but Ben Carson has definitely more and deeper Christian values compared to Donald Trump. The best for America would be Trump for President and Carson for vicePresident. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This African guy stupid. cant even go to the state of Iowa. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if this white lady lived the black experience. she would not be employed. and for Dr. Carson, black people are not monolithic, but racism, and white supremacy... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben Carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont believe Fox, Trump will not be the candidate. Vote for a morally intelligent man . Dr Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson made the comment first, Trump just hit back. Trump is not weak. Trump cannot be controlled. That is what America needs. The media is working with the establishment, and the establishment wants a front runner they can control. They are now trying to help Ben Carson by twisting the truth. It will be funny to see how that will backfire!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Huckabee Carson. .......or Carson Huckabee. ........that would be a great team for the US, and for the free world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson puts it right out. The dumming down he speaks about was planned long ago. I suggest a video from Charlotte Iserbyte. I have not voted in quite a while, and I pray it is not too late for Dr. Carter to become President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
jindals got a point!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben Carson is the man 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>
That fool Carson made a good point where will Trump send the people who were born here? They would be stateless. He cant force Mexico to take people who arent Mexican. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson, youre a sick man. By the way, the Supreme Court cannot legislate laws from the bench. That takes Congress. And no one took a vote. It is not the law of the land. It is illegal and immoral and all the double talk you people do only makes you more ill. You make no sense and you never will. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson talks religious bullshit. Fact is You break the law, you go to jail. Three options Comply, quit your job or go to jail. This case proves that no religious person should ever hold any public office, including the now 16 Repubs for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I predict the normally cruel liberals will now accuse Ben Carson of benefitting from afirmative action. The liberals will never let blacks think they succeeded on their own merits. They, in so many words, imply that they own them. Harks back to the Democratic partys roots in slavery. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great responses, Dr. Carson...Im hopeful that people see that your quiet, thoughtful, demeanor doesnt mean that you arent a fighter. The message is in your content. I am also going to watch future discussions to see what unfolds, and I hope that you are tested and tested...because I have no doubt you will succeed! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is Too Soft to be President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so ben just asked trump of he was a fateful person, than trump takes offense to that and attacks ben carson..... trump is a dumb person and cant get his story straight <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If the Republicans do not want to fail one more election, they have to vote for Ben Carson. Romeny was a better candidate than Trump and he could not win the election. Republicans please think properly <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I respect that Fox is showing Trump in a fair objective light, I know theyd personally like to see a candidate besides Trump be the republican nominee. I personally want Carson, but I like a lot of the issues Trumps speaks about. Cary is a great candidate as well, any of these three would be better than Hilary Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No Carson you are completely wrong. We are a republic democracy not a Theocracy. Take your Bible and shove it up your Anus or move to Iran. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The more Donald attacks Carson the more it will back fire and bite him in the behind. Go Ben Go! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is just a piece of filth ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
humilty and fear of the lord. carson is OUT! we dont want bible thumpers or people who flaunt their religion. its a private matter and politics are supposed to be SEPARATE from religion. separation of church and state. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
At this EARLY juncture I REALLY like the CruzCarson TEAM ! Both Staunch Constitutionally Based Ethically, Morally Faith solidarity! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is too nice to bash an asshole like Donald Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump only shouts... Trump has so much to learn from Ben Carson... Ben Carson will stand for the people and not for his own financial benifit. Please be aware of Trump and the employee ruining the core common sense and integrity by corruptions <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Honestly ..... Ben carson is cutting himself short... BLACKS are majority democrat... HE CAN WIN THEIR VOTE.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i am Pakistani and i have nothing to do with U.S but i think Ben Carson Looks Serious and Donald trump is loose cannon <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson Seventhday Adventists do not celebrate Christmas or other religious festivals throughout the calendar year as holy feasts established by God. Hummm no more Easter egg hunts 1 John 222 Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the Antichrist the Father and the Son.Did someone call Obama the Antichrist??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has my vote! He is humble and wiser.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
we are mostly Christians, Ben guy wants more votes. He tells us now he s a follower,,,,, that s terrible. Tell us that before.... Too soft spoken and delayed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Awesome! An educated man is a free man very well put by Mr. Carson. Do not expect for any one presidency to change things around in 4 or 8 years for what took generations to construct. The answer is in the hands of the family household and in moms and dads teaching their kids right from wrong. So that when this youth leaves the protection at their home, the will have enough within themselves to protect them from the jackals on the streets. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson would be a wise choice for Americans to make. ......hope he wins, thats for sure. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Token republican black guy vs. reality tv star for candidate and shepherd of the stupid. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is full of ideas and substances. This country needs a problem solver like Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP SHOULD KEEP ON ATTACKING CARSON!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate to point it out, but when Dr. Carson was born, an African American could be jailed in at least 16 states for marrying a white person, and a lot of those laws had at least some roots in the religious beliefs of the legislators who passed them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson puts me to sleep. ZZZzz TRUMP is at least exciting to watch. We need a charismatic leader. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a dumbass again. Hes always on the wrong side of sucking. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

im glad bill calls his weak ass out im a christian and if ben had any class and was really a mature christian he would show trump love as his brother in christ carson is a hypocrite and trump was right carson really does make jeb bush look like the energizer bunny lol ben is full of it and weak always tiptoeing around any question freaking weak ben cant even answer a straight question <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For the record, it was Ben Carson who ATTACKED TRUMP FIRST, look at the bias of Fox news where the title implies Donald Trump is attacking Ben Carson. Sorry, Trump is counterpunching Shame on Faux news, just another LIBERAL outfit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox is anti Trump pro Bush. Carson is a good guy but not Presidential. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson, or nobody !!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Ben Carson. He is so intelligent and thoughtful...However, he is just good enough to be 2nd commander in chief behind Donald Trump. It will be great to have TrumpCarson 2016. We will sure have a great country again! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson needs to sit down Trump 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016. Ben Carson only had ONE nurse. Come on, everybody can hire one person in his office. Hillary Clinton is a murderer in Benhgazi case. Thats why FBI is chasing after her to look for evidence from her emails. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson knows trump isnt a divider. Thats why he didnt answer the question. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donal trump is dumb,and hes one of the worst president of the world,worst than Iran.hes like a hittler 2.0 but du so if he does this and get elected he will fall shust like the Berlin Wall, this even can make a ww3 bad Americans are cool people but trump is a discrimination to the U.S. Race <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the fact that he admitted that he slipped with the Trump religious comment sets him apart from the majority of the other candidates. Such a statements adds credibility to his honesty. Carson still has my trust and I would be happy to see him as a vice president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson as a person. I wonder however idf such a soft spoken man can move the mountains that will be required to bring this country back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is completely out of his depth. A new Herman Cain... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I loved everything she read from his book.... absolutely right on target! We dont want the consolation prize of food stamps and section 8 housing, and a lifetime of endless government paperwork We want to be able to work to provide our own, choose our own Ben Carson knows of what he speaks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson for President 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doesnt sound like amnesty to me. If you are going to deport all of the individuals, you better damn well tell us how you are going to fund it. Down to the last cent. A wall is a good idea, but not for the whole border. Thats why Carson talks about drones and more border security officers. Only idiots hear what they want to hear. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love the way Ben Carson sees issues clearly for what they are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I tried to get my sister to watch this video and she just huffed out of boredom and left after the first 4 minutes lol. Carson is a nice guy and he is intelligent, but he is less interesting than watching paint dry. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson, He wont answer any questions. Asshole, period. I would vote for Trump, like so many, just because he is not a weasel. Hot air, but no weasel. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
None of what Ben Carson said makes any sense it was complete gibberish. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Keep in mind, when asked about liberal representation on his network, Rupert Murdoch, the owner of fake news big boob channel and Australian billionaire pointed to Greta. Great is a liberal, he said. Well, I just watched this softball interview with right wing nut case Ben Carson. Greta is no liberal and fake news isnt news at all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He just said he is for illegal immigration! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont know Black President?? Obama is Black he didnt do anything just a Fat Lair. I prefer another Red Neck Duded for President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not voting for Carson but he does have good points <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He isnt close. Ben Carson isnt really trying tho.. He is just monkeying around. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump for President. Carson for Surgeon General. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The title of the video should be, Ben Carson attacks Donald Trump on religion and Donald Trump responds! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

black people have created 1. more ghettos 2. more crimes 3. more liquer stores .......need I say more?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey Fox Carson is the one that attacked Trumps faith. Trump merely finished this reprehensible exchange, by giving back in kind. Get the story straight, Bushers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just the fact that hes running for the a president and being a politician makes him a fake religious person. All politicians LIE. MUAHAHA. So no hes definitely not religious. Bye bye im gonna go to the beach. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HAHAHAHAHA!!! About time... Lindsey Graham and Chris Christie should drop out next! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I would definitely vote for Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson has a window in to Donald Trumps soul. Plz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Can someone please tell me one statement of substance that Carson said in this whole interview. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And this is why Dr. Ben Carson will get almost NONE of the black vote. So, I hope he doesnt wonder why. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump... the Art of the Deal with it. Sick of the bullshit from the bought and paid for career Politicians in Washington and their puppets in the modern Media. Trump Carson is the ticket to make America Great again. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You have to advance at least 2 mins to get past that big mouth wench and to Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben carson srry dude but you should stop and go back to what you do. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson talks like he needs brain surgery himself. LOL And Jindal nobody wants a Gypsy as president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is just an arrogant asshole who knows absolutely nothing about foreign policy, the economy , the military ect. He has no idea how things work in Washington and he has absolutely no qualifications to be president. It just shows how many unimformed people are in this country that support this thug! You dont get things done by getting mad and calling people disgusting names. Thats Donald Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Syria and Irag refugees? No way. We cant take of our own problems. Until we do, nobody in, all illegals out. Ben Carson, although a good man, is way off on deportation. Ben asks Where do we put them?. We take them across the line and drop them off. We have the means and resources to do so. Someone representing us needs to bring in the clean up crew. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is too smart and to reserved to fire back He doesnt need to fire back at anyone, he showcases his character openly and honestly. if you dont like it dont vote for him, if you do then vote for him, were on the same page. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fuck beck, fuck trump, fuck the guy on the left, if anyone its ben carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Trump . But if he really wants to viciously attack a Republican . He should aim his ire at the House and Senate Leadership . Going after Carson Fiorina makes him look and sound petty . And giving an interview to Rolling Stone Magazine is just plain stupid . Im beginning to agree with others that Trumps worst enemy ? May indeed be himself . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson, I might actually consider supporting you if you werent so dead wrong on gay rights and separation of church and state, youre right on a lot of things, but youre dead wrong on this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Personally I think a TrumpCarson ticket would be unstoppable, but there can be only one right now for the nomination, the head chopping will continue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Me hope Carson chokes on a chicken bone at a KFC restaurant ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Both parties are a disgrace to this nation, lets hope outsiders like Trump or Carson get the GOP nominee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Ben Carson for President 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I respect Ben Carson but that is unfair for trump to ask Ben that same question after Trump was put on the spot first. This gives Carson time to prepare. It doesnt take a rocket scientist for Ben to know they may ask him that. I have read the bible years ago and I would be hurt to remember a chapverse without it sounding wrong. I am voting Trump because he is what I think this country needs, not someone who can remember bible verses exactly <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No it will help him since those who are attacking Trump go down.....Do you understand?Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson might win Iowa, since he seems to be a true Christian. But thats it. Iowa will be the high point of Carsons campaign. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has a cantdo attitude. Thats not American. GTFO. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I believe 100% that Carson is more humble and has more true Christian Faith than The Trumpet. But for President we need a tough guy who knows everyone. That is Trump and not Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You guys should see what Trump said about this...he said Carson makes Bush look like the energizer bunny lolololol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is saying religious liberty is important, but only for Christians. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson, youre content of character is not good if you think Kim Davis and her disciples have the right to break the law based on their believes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Megyn you are DESPICABLE. Carson did NOT fire back at Trump. You tried to bait him but unlike YOU, he has more grace than to take that bait, no matter how many times you try. Youve really turned into another lamestream media talking head. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
O M G....there goes another politician jumping on the kim davis bandwagon....trying to increase the likelihood of votes. Look, Dr Carson, Kim Davis, and all the republicans whose life is just so screwed up because of the gays getting married....NEWS FLASH you dont have to believe or support the gays at ALL.....but, YOU DO have to follow the law. Period. It really is that black and white. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is not a christian, he is a seventh day adventist <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BERNIE SANDERS 2016 FEEL THE BERN MOTHERFUCKERS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
imo i believe Ben Carson would be a great president for 2016, as for Kim Davis she shouldve been fired from her job and not jailed .. end of case. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like dr. Carson but, he is too mellow for all the shit USA is facing at this point in time, we dont need nice, we need common sense to make this country great again! TRUMP! 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson didnt even answer the first question about creating jobs. I tuned out right after that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
shame on you Kelly because your fight with trump you try to start a fight between Trump and Carson shame on you <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you agree with Kim Davis, youre an idiot. Im not sugar coating it no no no, you are a complete fucking idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson would be a good new mother Teresa. Be hes not even close to being tough enough for being a president of the united states of America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont be STUPID Americans as your last 4 presidential choices show, Donald TRUMP is now our only hope to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #GoodGuyDonald #TRUMP2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump may be more popular...but man Carson, a physician, could totally change our nation... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The thing that bothers me the most from Carson is his opinion about the Kim Davis case. Hes saying that because the United States is mostly Christian she should have accommodations other people with different beliefs cant. Im sorry but that sounds like because the majority of the people is white black people are less important. Is just a ridiculous and unintelligent response. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson talks about not forcing views on others but thats exactly what Davis was doing by refusing to issue licences unconstitutionally! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope he at least gets the VP nomination, hes such a great example role model <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson cant beat any democrat. I cant believe he is even running. Gee Carson you sure had enough time to rehearse that bible question as it was hit to Trump first. TRUMP 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson for prez. 2016. Can not wait to vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Amen Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The best us Ben Carson!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has no chance to be president if he gets close the naacp will make sure of it they will bring a line of women anxious to bring him up on charges of sexual improprieties. Oh by the way he is very intelligent would not be a surgeon if he wasnt. All Trump has to say its going to be great I pray that it is <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
PLEASE GO FUCK YOURSELF BEN CARSON <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would like to see Trump as President and Carson VP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He didnt FIRE BACK. Good try, Fox News. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Faq this Ben Carson. He sounds like hes gona sleep. Hate hearing him talk. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kim Davis and Carson are clearly homophobic. If she is not impeached by the locals asap it would clearly show how weak we are as Americans. What ever happened to majority rules. We voted, it passed deal with it or resign. Go trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The racism in American is just sad. God Bless Ben Carson. Hopefully Cali, Florida, Texas, NY can outvote the hate. Iowa too Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has valid points..but there is no excuse for the way cops treat nonwhite American citizens. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ya You Go With Experience In Money ! Donald J Trump.. Who Knows Numbers! and Has no Puppets Paying him ! This Man Carson Dose Not Compare to Donald Trump! Or His Record <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everybody, lets promote Dr. Carson! Spread the word within media and with those around you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She pounded the final nail in the coffin of your ailing movement. America does not want their government to look like a bad parody of a Deliverance style, snake holding revival meeting. Not to mention Huckabee was nauseating to all but a tiny section of the fringe nut bag base. He blatantly lied about the law and the Supreme Court, and is fomenting hatred and appealing to the worst nature of Americas most ignorant people. Carson is merely the house negro piling on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON ALL THE WAY! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is basically saying that if Christians can actively prevent gay persons from getting married, that is just them enjoying their JudeoChristian lifestyles, but if two gay persons are getting married legally, they are thereby imposing their lifestyles on Christians. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FOX NEWS IS NOT REAL NEWS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has zero shot. Only reason hes close is because hes black and republicans want to show their not racist in order to win over some soft democrats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow. Im appalled at some of the remarks on here. I see Dr. Carson as a highly intelligent man of integrity. Integrity seems to be in short supply in the world we live in. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im glad hes beating Donal a Trump.... Lets admit it people, trump doesnt know a single bible verse <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ah man. That Jeb ad shouldve been for Ben Carson. He speaks too slowly man. Makes me drowsy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Megyn is a bimbo and Carson is a corporate Rat with low energy! !!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everything is always cast in the light of race. Why cant you actually look at the content of a persons character, and see what they have to say. If they happen to be of one race or another race , so be it....that does not have to be the central issue. Well spoken Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The man has made some good points I grew up in South Central Los Angeles during the 50s and 60s and he is right about there being black Americans who agree with his point of view but are intimidated into not speaking openly about it. I believe Ben Carson may just draw a large number of people of color to vote for him. Im considering it myself very seriously. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love both Carson and Trump, but Carsons response to Trumps little jab is very concerning. Saying that I really like Carson a lot. Hes a real guy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump Carson would make a great Combo. Trumps efficiency and charisma mixed with charitable, moral, and generous nature of Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is just Obama lite. Carson is the real deal. Support Ben Carson for President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
excellent!!!! Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I liked Carson but he contradicts himself as he is a neurosurgeon but is for MANDATORY VACCINATIONS? ?? REALLY?? He should be against vaccinations if you ask me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson stands up for his faith no matter what the liberals in these comments say. Props. Gods not dead and now that America is letting go of God is a disgrace to even the Puritans that founded this nation. SMH <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is one dumb religion nigga. When he speaks, one has to wonder what hes on. Surely as a surgeon he has access to some good shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has been around and this sucker dont have the drive or speed to keep up! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This bitch is dumb trying to instigate a fight, i see why trump hates her, besides her ignorant questions, Carson should have told her to fuck off <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson seems like hes constantly battling a narcoleptic event. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

TRUMP 2016 and the democratic Commie CNN cannot stand TRUMP IS WINNING AND WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson just wants to get into Kims pants. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Amazing that Fox is trying make people think Carson is a threat to Trump when he only doing well in one state and Trump is leading by far in other states and nationally. A new poll also has Trump beating Clinton , Sanders, Biden and Gore in a head to head match ups. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont trust a single one of these corrupt politicians , democrats or republicans, but i wouldnt mind trump carson combo. I would give them 4 years in office. Brute force and brains. At this point i dont really care. I dont care if its Jeb , Hill, or Biden, or Burn, none of them really have what its going to take to face the future this world is heading towards. This countrys going to hell in a hand basket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its obvious Carson is a democrat mole being used to take the stage away from Trump for all the idiots who will fall for his Bullshit! Carson is a Democratic saboteur sent into the Republican camp! TRUMP 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson honestly isnt a leader or a manager. seems like a nice guy but we need strength. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

We are asking if you want to president not a pastor. Why is this guy running he is on too many meds <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Carson seems like the nicest most sincere person in the world.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Ben Carson is a good man. The more he talks the more I like him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump does NOT need the Latino vote, to become President. Latinos vote 8 to 10 Democrat, at any rate. Trump, simply, needs to get a large portion of Black votes and MOST IMPORTANTLY... He needs to get the majority of the White voters to show up election day which he will this time around. ROMNEY WOULD HAVE WON, IF THE WHITE REPUBLICAN BASE WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT TO VOTE, LAST TIME. A Trump Carson 2016 Ticket will be a landslide victory <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Staying positive when at war against thieving neocommunist godmocking control freak liars in the Democratic Party or the Republican phonies who go along with them simply tells me Ben Carson may be out of his depth at this level. One must verbally lunge at the throats of these hateful liberals and leave them gasping for air. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson makes great sense, if he doesnt win the Republican Nomination for the 2016 Presidential race, I pray that he or she who does win appoints Dr. Carson to a very high level position. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
AMAZING that Fox and CNN are trying to manipulate who the presidential candidates are going to be. You push trump in the morning and bush in the evening with a dash of rubio, fiorina and now carson yet hardly report on Cruz who is rising when people hear him. I have to wonder why Fox has become like liberal networks, no longer reporting news but manipulating it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is PRO FORCED vaccinations! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I was going to blast Dr. Carson before reading the headlines. I stand by him. Not all his views because we are two different individuals and I have my own opinions like he does. This is my country. I was here before the Europeans, the Red Natives, the Africans. My ancestors were the mound builders. I was not ever a slave nor indentured servant. Gd Bless America. Dr. Ben Carson for President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is the same interview from a month ago. lol stop repeating yourself and get on a new topic <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Millenials are backing Sanders... no one under the age of 45 supports trump unless they come from one of those sheltered families where the parents brainwash the children into mirroring their opinions. If parents have successfully taught their children to think for themselves like functioning adults are supposed to then they most certainly wont be voting for a reality tv star, the woman who nearly ran HP into the ground, OR the token republican black guy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
While I hope Carson gets the nomination, its going to be TrumpCarson 2016. Probably vs BidenSanders. Who will win? No idea. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald Trump is UNITING Moderates, Conservatives, and Democrats BECAUSE HE IS RUNNING ON COMMON GROUND ISSUES, instead of along partisan ideology. WE MIGHT NOT ALL AGREE, ON EVERYTHING...BUT WE CONCUR ON THE IMPORTANT ONES, LIKE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. A TRUMP CARSON 2016 WILL BE A LANDSLIDE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Pauls problem is hes too smart. Most voters are morons and they see one of their own in Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sanders beats Bush in new national polls, he in fact beats all but Trump and Carson both are statistical ties with Sanders This is without a single democratic debate yet and the majority of media attention going to Trump Emailgate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I agree with Dr. Carson speaking about these issues he just mentioned. The only uncertainty is if he was to win presidency would he address these issues that he just stated? Thats the question. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr . Carson youre right! we need to especially embrace our AfroAmerican young men and help them to understand how valuable getting an education is instead of a record deal because when that fails what will you have to fall back on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I like Donald Trump. But I admire Dr Carson. Hes slow and has a well thought out game plan. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The REAL reason Trump is ignoring Carson and going after Bush is because we ALL know the GOP will Never nominate a person of color or a woman for President. Carson is just another black token just like Herman Cain was last cycle. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The REAL reason Trump is going after Jeb and not Carson is because we ALL know the GOP would NEVER nominate a Black man for President. Lets get honest folks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This man is going to get killed for speaking the TRUTH. The political parties arent handling the situation properly. 1.The republicans are ignoring domestic issues and focusing on foreign interests. 2.The democrats have blanket solutions banning guns, welfare checks that either create more problems or just pacify the causes.

Ben Carson is a joke. You cannot say you want to reform the education system when you actually just want to privatize it. Same goes for this war on the poor he speaks of. The GOP have been systematically cutting welfare and making it harder and harder for people to get onto it. Ben Carson may be black, but he doesnt give a shit about black people. Same goes for veterans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
its hilarious and pathetic that trump supporters are going out of there way to find a Hispanic name a Hispanics picture and blabbering Hispanics for trump. lol true hispanics will never vote for him oh and we dont fill polls but if gets nominated you better believe youll feel our presence in the general election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

His records says he is against semiautos, and thats b.s. If he would stand up for the 2nd Amendment, he could get way more support. But if he is against it, he cant really have a chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She will never be president. Id rather vote for Trump, and Im black. we are the most democratic people on the planet. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not to mention, if there was a black movement that protested the glamorization of black men as thugs and women as trash, as he suggests, how is that any more valid than protesting the abuse of black men by police departments around the country? Any one of those causes he deems worthy can equally be attacked as insignificant when taken alone. Again, its a diversion and a tool he is using to garner more support from white conservatives for his candidacy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That is a diversion, not a debunking of the black lives matter cause. All of those things matter and the BLM movement is valid. Carson is a tool of the GOP. No surprise there. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Meghan McCain in just another poser RINOsucking pig. ... and her father ISNT a war hero <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson being proforced vaccinations makes him a more positive candidate as far as Im concerned. Good for him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
once Carson gets media scrutiny, hes done. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is the Tiger and we need a Tiger, but TrumpCarson would be the unbeatable team. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Establishment talking heads make me just about as angry as establishment politicians. These 3 people are goons who have no pulse on the american people. Get out of the city and go meet regular people....then the rise of Trump, Carson and Fiorina will make more sense to you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is PRO FORCED vaccinations! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson should NOT be discussed in race discussion. Talk about how he is capable of solving complex issues. Hes one incredible man! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Like I keep telling you people...Carson is a nutcase..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LOL What a blatant hit piece . Fox cant buy off Trump so they are selling Ben Carson. Ben WHO???? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is right n id vote for u. Thanku for not degrading all blks as a whole. N im sick of rap its fucked up how the women r sex slaved and so called men r thugs n its koo!

Ben Carson for president... Fuck it Ill run with a CarsonTrump campaign!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson speaks so slowly I get drowsy listening to him. He makes Jeb sound hyper. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People that are running against trump...Are running after trump. Its hilarious. The Republicans Except Cruz, Carly, Carson are OBSESSED with him. Christie is a follower....And a marsh mellow of a man. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
here we have a man that will tell the truth about people of his ethnicity , and hes not afraid to say it ,this is a man thats running for president to serve for all Americans of all ethnicity , not just one type of ethnicity, and hes right to say that certain communities will ignore the real issues that bring them down, to point the finger at another ethnicity, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I swear to god if you go back and reread history Trump is exactly like Ronald Reagan <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FOX NEWS DOESNT BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY. THATS WHY THEY DONATE TO HILLARY CLINTON AND REFUSE TO COVER BERNIE SANDERS. WE NEED TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED IN ORDER TO RESTORE LEGITIMACY TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Right now it looks like its Carson vs. Trump. I really want those two to go head to head as candidates who never held office. Obviously Carson would come out on top as the more serious candidate, but itll be good to see Trump lose the spotlight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a radical violent Christian that no more believes in tolerance of and freedom for others than does the Taliban.! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When he talks as a doctor as opposed to a lockstep Republican, Dr. Carson makes an appealing choice. But he is destroying his reputation every time he panders to Conservatives with his wishywashy rhetoric. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is a good man, in a world with very few good men. i dont think 2016 is his year, but he would make an excellent Vice President, and once he spearheaded the fix on Obamacare, he would be a shoein for the Presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON he is a GREAT MAN...He has my vote NO DOUBT <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This fucking guy is nothing like his father. This guy is way too establishmentarian. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary and Donald are bad for America and good for late night talk show host. They both have too much of a comical past in the public eye. Bernie Sanders is the real threat. Im for Carson to put some morals back in the house. Fix a problem at the foundation not the superficial problems. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is a great man and an inspiration to all. If my girl left me for him I would completely understand D <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The REALITY of it is, most of you at Fox News have had it in for Donald Trump from the beginning!!!!!!!! To the point where it looks like Fox News is being PAID OFF by the Bush camp! You guys have had it all backwards!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Heal Inspire Revive, Ben Carson for President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youd think fox news being conservative would try to throw Carson some soft ball questions, but it seems almost as if a liberal were interviewing him by interrupting, not letting him finish and asking questions on topics that make most feel uneasy. Despite it, he handled it like a champ. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I know Ben Carson is quiet and thats his personality but I want a president who gives the people motivation and makes a nation believe. When George Bush was president he had great vocalization and would really get the people energized and determined. I can see that with like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Chris Christie. I just dont see that with Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Stupid as shit. So what exactly is the plan here? Is there one? Is it to magically make people succeed in school and in a career simply by President Ben Carson being a shimmering example of what to strive for??? If you just read more books the cops wont shoot you!!! Lmmfao <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
4 minutes of pundits saying that Ben Carson needs to raise more monies and behold himself to more establishment donors which is the opposite of what voters want. Best thing for Trump is that no one says that he needs to sell out to win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson will be president based on the color of his skin. We will never have another white president in the United States of America ever again. Lol fine by me <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I can respect Ben Carson, but I cannot respect Fox News. I only made it to 145. This bubbleheaded bleach blonde airhead has no business conducting an interview. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson is much much scarier than Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Both Trump and Carson are in great positions because Trump and Carson supporters are the same so if either drops out the other will get the votes and a TrumpCarson bill would be unbeatable...... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is trying to copy Trump and in fact is using most of Trumps ideas. But he will fail because Americans do not want anymore bought and paid for presidents. And Carson is Buying into the Puppet Masters Strings! Donald Trump wins the 2016 election and Donald Trump IS the next President of the United States of America! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not saying Im going to vote for Carson, but I love the hell out of his perspective on this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson doing so well in the poll proves that US is over with racism. We have a 2 term black president and we now have Carson doing so well. My sister will vote for Carson. And I might say Carson is very appealing and I like his calm but solid manner. But, Trump is more fun to watch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Very impressive and impactfull message Dr. Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Haha good for Carson. But I must say. I really hate Megyn Kelly <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I used to like Christie. But then I watched as he contributed in a major way to the reelection of Obama by hugging him and kissing his ass after the Sandy storm while at the same time totally backstabbing Romney. Lost all respect for Christie. A loudmouthed political opportunist. Rand Paul is a whack job. Not a lot of good choices for Republicans. President Hillary Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like carson. But I think the person who will be able to accomplish this best is trump. If the citizens of other countries are not here competing for jobs and the welfare state is reduced, many will have no choice but to start working and get their asses off welfare <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a Trump supporter, but would rather have Hillary than Carson, wholl be another donothing RINO ! At least with Hillary, the Left Lib insanity would be on full display to further awaken sleeping conservatives and independents. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The Republicans has so many good candidates yet, they choose Trump... If Trump wins then then expect Colonel Sanders or Hillary Clinton to win in a landslide! I hope Carson beats Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I started out rooting for trump because he ,although being kind of a dick about things, is really smart and I agree with many of his thoughts. but I must say carson was a close second and after doing more research on him he has risen to the top in my mind. carson would be a better president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
im starting to like carson more than trump. Ive always liked carson since I discovered him ,but as of now carson would be the best president in my mind. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Black people do NOT VOTE for this wolf in sheeps clothing! you know somethings WRONG when Fox news is on his side! a republican president will make this country a brutal cold racist place and YOU KNOW IT.

I canr see a Pediatric Surgeon cutting food stamps to destitute families. He may run for the GOP, but Ben Carsons natural empathy would result in a progressive administration with tighter abortion restrictions but fewer drones. Be careful what you wish for.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I want you people voting for Carson to keep one thing in mind he is PRO forced vaccination! More of the same crap we already have! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson should also put one of his reading rooms in Appalachia where White live in poverty but dont commit the crimes that blacks do. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes, abortion is murder. Im not in support for Carson. Many may not know this but He is using the Eminem Song Lose Yourself for his Campaign song. In this song it reads.... This world is mine for the taking, Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order.. As a Christian, this is very bothersome to me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is exciting and I love him but art the end of the day Ben Carson is the sanest choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox NEEDS hillary. Thats why they talk about her 90% of the time their lips are flapping. Hillary running as democratic candidate is the ONLY way a republican stands a chance at ever sitting in the white house. They certainly cant do it on their own credibility and intelligence so the only way to succeed is to pray for an even more corrupt, even weaker candidate that makes them look better by comparison. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is typical of whats happening in this country. Fox news brings him on to denigrate black Americans but he never mentions nor do they that he was once on welfare so before you help him with his message find out the truth about him when he says that blacks should take responsibility for their actions <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Personally Joe Biden is 72 now, if he wins, he will be 74 before he gets in the white house. which will make 79 by the time swearing a new president comes along. Average age of death is 76, so the odds are we will lose the president half way threw is 1st term. And this is the best the Democrats have to offer? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a coon <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Ben Carson hope he wins the presidency him or trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson may be a good doctor, but he is a terrible candidate for the presidency. He wants to drone our lady parts, doesnt he? Carson, Kasich, Bush, Rubio, Paul, Christie, Cruz, Walker, Huckabee and the all mighty Trump, dont have a chance against Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson will be destroyed in an one on one debate. Hes very much an amateur. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I Fully Agree With Dr. Ben Carson But Need of the Hour is TRUMP for making some strong Tough Decisions for america Strong Stand against the Islamic Fundamentalism Terrorism which is becoming a very dangerous threat for the whole world TRUMP 2016 As President Dr Ben Carson As VicePresident would be a great team that will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

they should not allow any public money to any private schools none, charter religious none of them. the schools do a pretty good job considering what they have to work with Ben Carson is a retard, we need to bring back trade schools and set up are public schools to run like college program 2 to 3 hours a day in math and English Monday Wednesday Friday Tuesday Thursday history and science and college and trade schools free. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is my #1, then Rand Paul, then Ted Cruz, then Ben Carson. If not one of those, I wont vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Racist have called me that, my whole life to their own hurt and shame. It doesnt bother me. Carson will never be POTUS. His once good name in the Black community is no more thats what racist wanted and hes no longer respected. Carson will be known as a coon, someone who lies and sells out Black people.

If the only way blacks can survive is by us forcing their teenage girls to have babies they dont want to have from unplanned pregnancies, then maybe Sanger was right about them and they are unfit.

Where in the world does she find out how to categorize people as terrorists? What are her sources smoking?

A man after my own heart. I have been telling bruthas and sistas this since I learned to see reality for what it is. If Democrats were so great, then why 50 years later are black people comparatively worse off in areas that matter, family, community, and workforce. Democrats consider Black votes as a give me vote and they dont even care about the black experience any more. They have move on to other races to make them victims and dependency votes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Excellent!!! It doesnt take a genius to say what Dr. Ben Carson has just said to understand that this makes a whole load of common sense which is what we already have but are too lazy to put it to good use. And its not a Democrat or Republican thing either but yet its a common sense thing that our God has given for us to use.Why not take advantage of the blessing and work for it??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Carson, I have a question for you if abortion should be completely unfunded by public funds medicaid, etc simply because many uninformed persons disagree with it then should gay married couples not get the same tax breaks as straight married couples because so many people disagree with that as well?

I am really starting to like this man because hes a good man who speaks the truth even if its unpopular with the general public or his own party. I totally respect that. And hes smart and talks with substance. I think he is probably the candidate I would most trust in the role of president, eventhough I dont agree with his more hawkish foriegn policy because I think hes smart, really cares about truth, and has a moral fiber rhan almostno other candidates have. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Holy cow a Republican with common sense. In THIS interview hes actually thinking, not jumping to conclusions and trying to think with a clear mind rather than seeing red i.e. anger. Do not necessarily agree with his tax policy at the end, but he is 100% correct about education. As an independent, I will say there is hope for the Republican side. He almost has my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

God also says that the most sinful people are still loved and still get to what the want. People who are against gay rights are idiots, all the time you hear what stops a women from marrying a lamp like shut up u idiot. Like the fact that that is even an argument is dumb.

How many inquests and studies have to prove that torture is ineffective before idiots like Carson understand that using it is more trouble than its worth? P.S. The Geneva Convention is not negotiable. There are basic ethical standards by which all humans must live, no matter whether or not it ties their hands behind their back. Go back to the drawing board, Carson oh, and also, answer questions upfront rather than dodging around. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Many Republicans are proving to be a s naive as a lot of Liberals in judging people. Trump has enough history as a liberal to show me that he is untrustworthy. Sure, he knows how to say things that he knows will get conservatives to like him, but I doubt if he will come through as a conservative President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats interesting Carson seems to think a foetus is a life only when the heart starts beating. So is it not a living being before that? What is it then? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is awesome. He doesnt worry about winning over voters, thats what politicians do. His focus is on making Value Guided Decisions and taking Purpose Driven Action. I dont see how illegals coming here and getting pregnant can be considered a valid way to become a part of this nation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson has zero chance to be nominated. Currently he is leading because of Blacks vote. Black voter Obama. What did he do for Blacks? Nothing. Blacks are still robing stores and doing drugs.

It is hilarious how on one side people bring up Margaret Singer and say things about her and grade people for being fans of hers. Then at the same type they treat Ayn Rand as if she was some type of priestess of Conservatism and Democracy. Then when you pare it down to her actual views on God and other things people do a back pedal and do not want to be so much absolute followers of her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016!!! He will save this county from doom. He next victim after Marco Rubio, a corporate shill who should not even be in this country, will be Ted Cruz, a guy who was NOT BORN IN THE USA!!

Make america great again and get rid of all the immigrants. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THANK YOU MR. TRUMP!! PLEASE HELP OUR ONCE GREAT COUNTRY. I agree, people like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz should not be citizens of this country.

The media thinks people are stupid. People know Kellys questions where rhetoric and people are sick and tired of the game, they want real leadership whos ready to get to work to solve problems.

After listening to Newt Gingrich I am flabbergasted at how we have a speaker of the house now who would at best maybe be allowed to bump ahead of people in a soup line. Maybe there only is one party already.

I do wish theyd stop questioning black candidates about black issues, as if thats their main reason for living. When was the last time a white candidate was questioned about white issues?

As a longtime Fox News viewer I was very disappointed with their handling of the debate.

Dude, the more Dr. Carson speaks, the more I like him. He is far more intelligent than any politician currently serving. Not only is he book smart, he is also street smart. Im switching affiliations to GOP to vote for him in the primaries. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the cure for the social cancer known as the GOPDemocrat establishments known affectionately as cancer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the GREATEST whether elected president or not. He is greater than all other candidates, democrats or republicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Pause at 050, The reject so called journalist who gets paid to trap would be great politicians into a corner, even knows himself hes just had his ass handed to him in less than 5 seconds. Trump is by far the best both Democrats and Republicans have hope for getting our country back to its historical greatness. Trump and Dr. Carson 2016 ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I was on the fence before the debate but Trump now has my vote. I also really like Carson and Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im a democrat, Ill tell you one thing I will not vote for Clinton or Sanders. These two are blowhards. The humble and easily smartest one out if this group is Carson. A neurosurgeon and reasonable guy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really wanted to vote for Ben Carson but Trump just completely spoke my mind...what now <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Republics are nervous now. Obviously the audience likes Trump. Donald Trump is not a puppet and does not have to fear to tell you the truth. As well, trump could expose the corruption of some politicians and can use this against them. They have nothing on him that would cause his downfall. Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and Trump are sincere and would love them to work together and get our country back. Thank you Mr. Trump for giving us hope. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wish all you SJWs, Feminists, Transgender sympathizers, and pussified liberal sheep would just disappear off the face of this planet. This countrys a fucking joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I really like this guy.. Dr. Ben Carson has a brilliant mind nerves of steel and hes a great negotiator . I wonder though does he ever get mad.. Hmmmm <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fire the time keeper! You hardly gave Carson anytime. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does carson think he is in church. Screw that! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Megyn, Im disappointed! Everyone has made disparaging remarks about others! Including YOU! or would you care to deny that? You also need to get that smirk off your face miss BIG HEAD!!! SMART ASS!!!

Obama is a brother but his campaign was funded by Republicans thats part of the reason I wouldnt vote for him I just kind of knew he was just talking when he ran. Im not a Republican but with Ben Carson vision for America I could vote for a Republican candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump should be president like Cheese sandwiches should have a layer of cat shit in the middle. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I want doctor Ben Carson to win, hes the smartest candidate maybe not politically, but definitely IQ and also, itd be awesome to have a doctor president or president doctor <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is prolly the coolest of these candidates <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How you all can defend Trump?! Really blows my mind. Maybe Carson was wrong in saying just some politicians had half their brains taken out. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Words US military capability coming straight out of Dr. B Carsons lower colon. He should keep his day job a surgeon. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If he wasnt for pushing vaccines on those who believe that theres a bigger risk injecting chemicals along with risking the body with a disease just for the chance to make a antibody for that disease, then they shouldnt have to do it. Btw, the guy that brought the measles into Disneyland was already vaccinated for the measles. If it was for the vaccines Id vote Ben Carson in a second. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
PaulCarson 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cannot believe the Trump supporters. Do you people understand what he said here? He said that single payer would have worked in America fifteen years ago. He didnt say it was a mistake to support it, he said he was right to support single payer then. That makes no sense. How can so many conservatives support this man? Especially when there are better candidates! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WOW GOP PUTS IN A BLACK MAN JUST TO PRETEND THEY ARENT RACIST. WHAT A BUNCH OF BIGOTS AND CARSON IS A LUNATIC CHRISTIAN WHO WOULD START WW3 JUST LIKE THE REST OF THOSE LOONS IN THE GOP CIRCUS. VOTE FOR HILLARY 2016 IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben Carson makers me proud to be an American , in that His success as a Doctor the mans a genius and a great Human being shows me that liberal extremest that Blame white people for all their ills are full of shit ... American ideology Worked DR. Ben Carson Aint no youngster , Now its broke and fcked up ...but i wouldnt vote for him to be president as he lacks experience. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People always talk about left wing conspiracies, but last night the way they went after trump was clearly a right wing conspiracy! The moderators were put up to this. Can any Republican still cry about Crowley when this goes on in their own party? There is also NO chance that any moderator in the national Presidential debates would levy crude attack after attack against one candidate. Fox has always had an agenda and Trump is clearly not part of that agenda. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson for president is a joke. Wake up America hes a surgeon and know nothing about politics <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You speak your mind and dont use politicians filter Proceeds to avoid the question and make a vague comment about what we need. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets talk about The evil Clinton money laundering Foundation !!! Ben Carson would have been a much better first black president !!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump straight up said stop bitching about your feelings there are more important things in this world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is 10 times smarter than hillary, or obamaaaaa !!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Looks like I ended up on the weird side of the internet again, where womens right is equal to militarized feminism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does anyone see the irony in that statement? This country needs a brain Not only does Trump not have one larger than a yeast cell, but neither does anyone else in the room. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She really didnt want Ben Carson to speak, because truth be told here we have another black man out classing these bums! But the truth be told I dont think the country is ready for another black president. The republican party would implode and self destruct. So for the countrys sake Trump for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love it!! Carson dosnt believe in fighting stupid wars! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

TRUMP RUBIO CARSON BUSH FORLORINA Yes, Trump the President with Rubio, Carson, Bush and Forlorina as the Vice Presidents. Theres no rule about how many Vie presidents the Nation can have. This would represent the People the Most. Alot more than that ugly whore clinton, she doesnt represent the people at all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson NAILS it!!!!!!!! What Obama has been doing to this country, Hillary would step in and MAKE IT WORSE. Period. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My dream team is Rand Paul as president and Ben Carson as vice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great job by Dr. Ben Carson. It is sad that all some people can remember is that when he was a kid he had a temper. I am sure we all have had to overcome some character flaws and likely are still overcoming character flaws. The difference is he did so by faith not by self help or selfeffort. That is lasting change. God bless! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The candidates who I really have faith in are Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, and Rand Paul. I would love to see any of them in office! The rest of the Republican field is... No bueno <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson will not win....go eat some kfc you fucking log....i saw his face and heard his answer, made me want to do Scorpions fatality, get over hear.....snap his head clean off <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everybody, except Donald Trump was talking like a tipical government robot for the media, but Donald Trump was being 100% genuine Donald Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson would be a great contender for President. However, he is facing an uphill battle because he is black and a Republican. Race will always be an issue in our country. Republicans agree with his point of views, but will never vote for him because of his race and minorities will not vote for him because he is a Republican and he constantly bashes our President who happens to be black. Im just saying what most people think, but will not admit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Once again he couldnt show evidence that MEXICO IS SENDING CRIMINALS. HES JUST BLOWING SMOKE. So far Ben Carson had the best responses. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
GO CARSON GO.........YOU HAVE MY VOTE, LOVE YOUR STYLE SOMETHING FRESH....WE NEED U <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Am I the only one who felt like throughout the entire debate fox was trying to limit rands air time? He got the lead amount of time on the mic, every Fox News analyst said he lost this argument with Christie, yet everybody outside of Fox News said Rand won. He also wasnt on hannitys show after the debate, when I believe EVERY single other candidate in the debate was <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Along with Carsons closing comment, this was the best moment of the night! Finally we have a man who is telling it like it is, and not taking any BS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders? The Socialist moron? Really? You Sanders supporters might as well stand in the middle of a crowd and yell Im a dumbass! because thats exactly what youre doing here. Idiots. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson, Huckabee and Rubio all did well. Fox and Bret Bair disappoints with opening question aimed a only one guy, with only one answer and for only one reason. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kelly just got trumped. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WE SPEND THE MOST MONEY ON OUR SAFETY...THIS MAKES NO SENSE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson should be president of the United States. He knows what every American feels and thinks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As prepared as he was. I guarantee you that JFK had to do a lot of fast studying and figuring when they first told him the Soviets were putting missiles into Cuba. I would not trust Donald Trump or Ted Cruz in that situation, but I would trust Ben Carson.thanks Battey for this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ohh, Carson did well. Carson is the tortoise in this team. Wise and indeed, he does not say what trump is already saying. He keeps it and says it ingenuously from within and when necessary. Ben Carson is the choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Political correct has nothing to do with insults and making derogatory comments. I was starting to like him but after the debate, I am not going for him, he was not objetive in any of his responses, and some of them he change the subject. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need another Black President! Theres no sense in going back downhill! Dont forget the Bush years! Ben Carson for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I think Cruz, Carson, and Rubio did the best in this debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The great thing about Carson is that he may not have the foreign policy knowledge of the other candidates, and he acknowledges that. However, he has the mental capacity and willingness to learn quickly that already make him a viable candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubios ears are fucking massive! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama said he evolved on gay marriage and conservatives lost their minds. Trump says hes evolved on nearly every conservative issue and everyone is infuriated with Megyn Kelly for asking a question. That is the freaking world I live in right now. God save us. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson, beautifully put. Personally, as a former honorable service member of the U.S. Armed Forces, Hilary Clinton should be tried for treason. She has way too many scandals under belt along with her husband. Remember Benghazi!? Enough said. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its been proven that torturing information out of someone rarely yields accurate information. But dont let facts keep you from doing dumb shit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

That was my favorite Kasich speech. lovely guy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not only did Trump survive the debate. He stole the entire show. Nothing kept him down, and he had a solid answer for everything. Also, he got the most cheers out of al the candidates. But, seriously, I wish they asked Ben Carson more questions. He seems like the only one who would make a better president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Say what?? Saying the words radical Islamic Terrorism will fix it?? Why not just click your heels three times and repeat theres no place like home, theres no place like home, theres no place like home <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

in my opinion this makes Paul look worse and makes me want to NOT vote for him even more.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow im impressed with Trumps tenacity and grit. And its about time we had a funny entertaining president. Maybe that will get more ppl being involved in this countrys political system <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is elegant, but a liar. For a comparison of our military strength v rest of world howmuchstrongeristheusmilitarycomparedwiththenextstrongestpower <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So hes saying that the problem wasnt really that we went into Iraq but that we left Iraq. Idiot <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like trump but Im not sure he has the political prowess to win the election, and Im not sure of his strategies to run the country. Hes a tough motherfucker though. I like Carson as President and Trump as VP. We are too soft as a nation , especially dealing with foreign relations. Trump would give some much needed assholeness. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Between Cruz and Trump I am torn.... I do admire both, but Trump has a further reach! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All you white racist fucks siding with Donald Trump lmao. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Republicans need to stop using the word god as it will alienate a large number of voters not just because they are not religious but because religion and politics should not be mixed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump brings a refreshing nonpolitical aspect to the debate, and so did Carson. But Trump has a good record of success, hes well stocked, hes got plans and can put up a fight in Congress. I think he can protect my rights as well as his most precious assets, so yeah, Id vote him in. I dont think someone could reason me out of that quite yet anyway. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She sounds like a breath of fresh air, I like Trump and Fiorina <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You cannot debunk the Donald. He has the resources and knowledge necessary to put the politicians in their place. I hope he gives them hell. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He is definitely one of my top favorites. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Loved Carson lets hear some more. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow Carson is the smartest there by far <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Horrible debate should have called it the Trump roast hour Thought Fox would have been fair but sadly like all big business media they were not. Trump was asked personal questions others were asked policy question. BTW at this point Americans deserve their fate for putting up with big business, media and lobby control... Sad Fox news included. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate republican politicians but Trump is spot on! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is too smart lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

As prepared as he was. I guarantee you that JFK had to do a lot of fast studying and figuring when they first told him the Soviets were putting missiles into Cuba. I would not trust Donald Trump or Ted Cruz in that situation, but I would trust Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

There is absolutely no way scott walker can get elected. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes dismissed on awkwardness alone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Ben Carson did a great job for someone who has never been in the spotlight like this before. Unfortunately because of Obama I think it will be decades before America is willing to elect another AfricanAmerican as president as sad as that is because there is several good black conservatives. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like him. Ill vote for him or Carson. Maybe Huckabee <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I just dont trust this guy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson won. Democrats are still losers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Loved his answer. We dont need politicians. We need people who love America and care about its future and its people. You cant be an expert on all subjects that is why you make sure you hire the best people for your administration to fill each role. A smart man hires smart people. Ben Carson is smart, such a refreshing difference than the morons we have running our govt now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets be real. People only tuned in to watch this debate just to see Donald Trump talk. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:2> <-emoji:0>
I think Dr. Carson would be a great president. Having a person that can think run the country instead of yet another career politician would be a very nice change. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This man needs to be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes the best bet out of all those guys there.... Well him and rand paul <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He couldnt get nothing done in the senate with his party as the majority in the house and senate now he thinks he can get shit done as president? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

God bless you doctor Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fox goes after Trump while lobbing softballs to Bush. Megan Kelly on her knees servicing the Bushes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes the only one who could run as an independent, and hes the only one whos honest enough to say it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Such a great man and a sincere politician...I hope he wins... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah we should ttoltaly grab a stuck up billionaire for president!!!!!! No. Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well hes certainly more a real candidate than Perry, Carson, or Santorum. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He was my first choice until Trump hit the scene. Im not sure these two titans could get along or else a TrumpCarson ticket would be interesting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the ONLY answer for what ails this country... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And he says Donald helps him because now no one asks him about his lack of political experience. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
R u kidding me, yes Ben Carson is the cure for the GOP! Even though I consider myself a democrat I would really vote for Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the man who said that Obamacare was worst than slavery !! Clearly this man is crazy so is most of the GOP runner <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson could take on Trump AND come out looking strong. Ben Carson is considered just as politically inexperienced, but Carson comes off as soft spoken and nonassertive. If he sticks it to Trump, he could take Trump down. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I PERSONALLY AS A BLACK MAN WILL VOTE OBAMA AGAIN ON 3RD TERM IF THAT WAS ALLOWED! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Jeb didnt have the last name Bush he would be in last place, he has the personality and charisma of a house plant. The GOP needs people with energy and enthusiasm not some lame duck banking on his last name, aside from Trump I like Walker and Christie but the rest are duds. Carson seems like a sincere guy but lacks energy and enthusiasm, he will be left in the back because of it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ugh! Who is that woman campaigning for Carson? Ugh! So jealous of Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson for president 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is such an interesting, charismatic person.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is honest and experienced. Ben Carson would make a great team player if they run together in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Didnt the d.e.a. just get busted for having sex parties funded by the cartel? Yes! Didnt 3 big banks just plead guilty to money laundering for the cartel. Yes.....all these problems must be fixed, or just make drugs legal <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Very badly argued by Gutfeld. Its a time span of 13 years in which white american terrorists have killed more people than islamic terrorists. IMO quite significant and a bit longer than the last time Gutfeld had breakfast. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul and Ben Carson are the only 2 real perspectives for president and this is why the 2 party primary system does not work .... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Paul is the most honest candidate so far, maybe Ben Carson is also honest, but he is not a politician. Rand Paul is doing great except for the dead Americans faux pas. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

An obvious case of the bigoted majority oppressing the minority. I dont give a shit if you and your religion embrace traditional marriage, this country was founded on freedom of religion. Your form of marriage should NOT be present in our government. Im tired of Christians who have an 80% majority playing the victim. Are there atheist or Muslim members of congress? Nope. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate that I agree with this ass snatch ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You got that right. DR. BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fellow Tubers, Dr. Ben Carson is a very good neurosurgeon. That said, he is not a psychologist. Two different fields. Ex a power lifter can not compete in the 100 yard dash. It be it, Ronin Kannushi <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Shiiiiiit....hes gonna be another Herman Cain. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All these fuckin scum bags that believe being gay is a choice and evolution is real...Dr Carson will change that woooooo <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Republicans will never put a black man in the white house dont be fooled they are just using him like micheal steel <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I knew Carson had a reason for always mentioning them Nazis. I just didnt realize he was trying to help us be better ones! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cause Ben Carson is just what we need! Hes the best of both sides. Hes a Warmonger, And we Republicans like our warmongers, Hes a socialist, Us democrats like our Sugar daddy socialism! Once we get ben our house wont be divided no longer. Hail Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A once proud and respected neurosurgeon.....now a laughing stock who denies evolution and thinks being gay is a choice. Pathetic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Both of these guys are AHoles. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets call IT just what IT is. IT is an AMATEUR, FRAUD, LIAR, et al...That THING in the White House. Bill OReilly telling Dr. Carson, Youre smart.. REALLY??? HELLO, Bill!!! Dr. Carson is beyond smart. Hes BRILLIANT and a selfmade man. Bubba, can you say the same for yourself? No. I didnt think so. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I want Jeb Bush to win! This will be our next president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, just horrendous. I understand the gut reactions to destroy ISIS even if western powers did create it but to say no rules in war opens the doors to innocent people and summary executions, you cant say or imply no rules or no morals or youll become just as evil as the enemy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an example of real wisdom and elder statesmanship! CARSON 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This man is a leader. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ben Carson a lot. Here he seems a little too hawkish for me, but still I hope he runs for President, because he will bring some brains to the public discussions of various issues. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If he runs... and no one better comes along, hes got my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

According to Ben Carson every raise in the minimum wage causes a recession. Do any of these candidates base their comments on data and facts? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Good public speeches dont make sound fiscal and social policy. That is what President Obama is lacking. I hope Ben Carson becomes the next President of the United States, for Ben can give inspiring speeches as well, but has more common fiscal and social sense. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson, Evolution vs Creationism search on you tube. be informed, dont be scared by the liberal media making fun of people who belief different. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is a perfect example of what is wrong with America, a president focused on stand up comedy, dividing people. Hes a Leader?, now there is the real joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If Mr. Carson or Donald Trump would promise to burn the Capitol Building down and drive the congressional cockroaches out of town, Id vote for him. The system is broke the republic is dysfunctional. Those who invest in government for a financial return are who the system serves. Unless we burn the corruption out, it is foreseeable that one day the republic will just pass into history without anybody noticing except for the loss of worthless noise and people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Science is not advanced enough for us to properly accept or reject religion outright so it still a very relevant issue. As far as we know, science need not neccessarily contradict religion, so they can actually coexist. I would give Ben Carson the benefit of the doubt since he has reach doctorate status and that implies an innate understanding of the sciences to go along with his religious decorum. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes Carson very religious and nice so sweet that if elected president would start a war with Russia, look it up u idiots! Also, SUPER PACS giving MILLIONS to his campaign for favors later like cheap labor.....why do you think CARSON is for AMNESTY......Corporations and lobbyists giving millions!............VIVA Senior Carson! with Carsons help soon we take over America! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I really dont see how the exaggerated movements and orgasmic facial expressions are necessary to play the violin. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like all of these dumb rumors the left makes up about Carson. Like how he believes the earth is only 6000 years old, that is not true. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson net worth 820 million says Bernie Sanders net worth 100500 thousand is one of the rich people doing bad things to poor people. Really?... Really... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I support Ben Carson because he changed my life when i was 18. It all happen when my teacher gave me the book Gifted Hands and ever since my life has change and like Carson dreamed of being a doctor I have a dream of being an entrepreneur and having a successful business and i wont stop untill i make it.

Ben Carson is inspiring! He has my vote! #WINBENWIN #BC2DC16 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Amazing, an openly Christian conservative man of science who is not afraid to say what he believes. Can you imagine something like this happening at a time like this. Do you suppose that other people might be willing to speak up now? He doesnt just say what everyone knows. He actually thinks for himself. Wow, how shocking, how dare he? I hope he perseveres and that he is able to make a difference. I think he already has. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson, keeping the progressive lefts life exciting and full of feigned outrage, and exposing their blatant arrogance and bigotry against people of faith. The American people are waking up thanks to people like him. Hes got my vote!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a believer in god and a believer in secular government this disgusts me <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would never vote for a religious man. Religion exists outside logic and reason. Dr. Ben Carson is playing a very dangerous game appealing to the hardcore Christians. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This gives me hope that if I lie about using a private email server to the public I can still have the possibility of being nominated. Oh wait, thats a benefit only the democrats can afford, but for how long? I hope Jeb Bush, Hillary, and Bernie get swept under the rug. Ben Carson seems to be a good pick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LETS GO BEN CARSON! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

No coverage of Ben Carson? Even if he didnt say anything, as the person in second that should be noteworthy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

President Obama is the ONLY President that cares about EVERYONE including the least, the lost, and the left out. I will be graduating from college in a year in a half so I can support my family better than any crappy 9 an hour job could. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

He has restored the world view of an America with honour. Thanks to POTUS and those who have been loyal citizens. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We in the U.S. are very fortunate to have such a deserving person leading the nation. Obama has been, and will be for the remaining 2 years, a great benefit to the U.S. and also to the rest of the world. We Americans should be thankful for our good fortune. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Today... America has been defeated... the Constitution is now officially made invalid. The nation is no longer a republic nor a democracy. It is now a fascist state.

Great work Ben Carson! Dont let CNN get to you. The people appreciate all your doing. The CNN reporter was rude in the way she would talk over your answers because she wasnt getting one she liked.

So many conspiracy theorists here, I think they all need Ben Carson the Smart neurosurgeon fix there fucked up, paranoid, antigovernment rage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I liked video only because I like Ben Carson, certainly not because I like CNN. I think cable as other networks should have a menu plan so I can deselect CNN and not have to fund CNN! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im black and Trump will be my president and hopefully Carson will be vice president! TrumpCarson 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FUCK CARSON! HES A PUPPET FOR THE RICH! FAKE FUCKING LIAR!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson lied about Ali Khamenei in 1968 Putin was only a 16 yo kid. Why would he lie about that? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has a lot of nerve, considering that his rightwing rhetoric inspires nuts like Dear in the first place. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is,an,idiot. he went there to do shit. if he wants to be president he needs to go to Israel first. so the jews can aprove him for presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson says to get away from the rhetoric.. LMFAO ooh man! thats rich <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Refugee camps are Nice lol did Carson visit Disneyland instead of a camp? He made me wanna live in one of those nice refugee camps. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How do you respond intelligently to ignorance. Just listen to the Doctor. Excellent response Dr. Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

ben carson is an idiot <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson and his fans are all delusional irrational assholes. But in America today, those seem like virtues. There are 1000s of people who make 100s of millions of dollars a year talking trash about the government and Obama but this mindless asshat thinks the US is going down the road of nazi germany? Unfuckingbelievable, he is as delusional as his fellow groids at Mizzou crying that someone used the n word <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good comments by Mr Carson. I cant understand how some people can be so mean in their comments to another human being. A talented, intelligent person who is trying his best to serve his country. Even if a person does not agree with him, he at least deserves respect for his efforts. And a lot of what he says also makes sense. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yup, Carson is a boss. And who is the interviewer? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is just another thing that it being blown way out of proportion. I mean come on this is outrageous how do we not know if he was just talking with his hands something that almost everyone does and not mocking this reporter who just so happened to have a disability. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Mr Carson Cool Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These talking heads do their best to skewer Dr. Carson but always end up looking foolish. You can see the smug looks on their faces as they ask their questions. She is typical in her breaking in on Dr. Carson while he is speaking. No manners at all. She interrupted several times. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck sake Carson always speaks like hes just woke up. No real leadership at all! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

John Kasich, a career politician, is irrelevant in this presidential election <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson the Americans are very dum down if you want to be president you are not going do it talking adout issues go to some foot ball games. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What obvious Lies this man spews without shame or hesitation. Let him stay there with his wife and children for a couple weeksmonths, then ask him again if the living conditions there are still adequate. Dr. B. Carson, you suck at lying, sir. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So basically, no, I dont believe it was an act of domestic terrorism because many of the people that Im pandering to support extreme measures to eliminate abortion in the United States of America. Even though abortion has been legal in the USA since 1973.Thats the translation from republican to English. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is She always interrupting? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump will follow Carson into irrelevance and Cruz will too. Its going to be a Kasich Rubio ticket. Ohio and Florida come on people its all about the electoral college not whats best for the people, if it was it would be Bernie Sanders in a landslide. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMPCARSON 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Repeatedly calling them BABY KILLERS is by definition dangerous rhetoric. Its like me calling All Cops Murderers and then a cop gets mysteriously shot in the back of the head by someone who was listening. Both the Left and Right do it, and none of it is acceptable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really dont understand why these News organizations interview any of these Republicans anymore? They all say pretty much the same things Obama sucks, everything hes done sucks and if you dont vote for me, the world will end. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wait, did this nigga just compare a known hate group, Family Research Council, to an individual carrying out a terrorist attack? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr Carson would be a good fanatic adventist pastor in a little rural rustic church. But USA need a great leader, moderate, modern, intelligent knownledgeable about the secular science, the foreign policy and the Economy as Mrs Hillary Clinton <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the day him or Carson become president is the day the us fucks off back 200 years in time <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson dumb, ignorant clueless on EVERYTHING but brain surgery. Now, if the presidency were cutting open heads, Id say sure. But its not. Ben has zero foreign policy knowledge. DEER IN HEADLIGHTS dumb. I know more about foreign policy. WHY? I read a lot. Something these moronic republicans nut jobs should do. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Homosexuality is a choice because Gang Members go into prison straight and when they come out, theyre gay. Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Who else is the NAACP going to vote for? Theres no black candidates liberal enough in this GOP race like Obama to back them up. Tim Scott and Ben Carson are threats to the black race as Uncle Toms. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No matter who is President there are always people who dont like them and have things to say. Not just Obama. The guy is half white, I dont know why all the issue about him being black. Carson is all black but when you listen to him speak, he is very intelligent obviously has been a great neurosurgeon. I dont know how good a president he would make but Im listening to what he has to say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is a very intelligent man. But this was a stupid thing to say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lets forget politics for a minute. Lets talk about this video. Question for the American People Do you people really want a guy like Donald Duck, I mean trump representing the American People or above all U.S.A. in General. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I was close to believing Donald trump saw Muslims celebrating 911......but then Ben carson said he saw it too <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has to be one of the most deluded religious freaks ever to run for office. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy didnt even realize he strengthened Carsons argument by stating that a Drugaddict goes into prison and come out a criminal., does that mean that all drugaddicts are criminal? I wish Carson would have caught that because he just basically said drugaddicts at some point chose to be a criminal in prison. Which basically backs up that heterosexuals at some point choose to be homosexuals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The party is a joke this year, got nut case Trump who insults and has no respect for anyone, and Carson who is extremely creepy. Bernie Sanders 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love you Dr. Carson! Tell the Truth! Win, Ben, win! THAT horrific, ignorant Liberal CNN reporter is the stupidest person on Earth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You know I used to be so upset how electoral collage votes mattered more than popular but now Im so thankful. My prediction? Trump will win popular but lose electoral, Hilary Clinton will come in second, and somehow Carson will barely win or itll go to the house because of lack of majority <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Maybe the angel that helped Ben Carson pass his Yale chemistry exam told him to Kill those Democrats and then bravely give yourself up .It has always amazed me that people who value life in the womb so much dont seem to value it at all once it is out of the womb. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
See, you fucking right wing cunts. When you go on tv and lie about people, demonizing them, other stupid right wing assholes go and kill them. These fucking cunts should be ashamed of themselves. Carly Fiorina should be ashamed of herself, the lying bitch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I know its a white guy because the media isnt calling this a terrorist attack. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love this man.. Ben Carson is smart and articulate and that drives the liberal community nuts. He is smarter and more accomplished than 90% of America and it pains many that he has good things to say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im so glad that Dr. Carson isnt a cknsht about addressing the muslim issue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

White people can do whatever they want. If it had been Carson or Obama when he was running for the illiterate they would be out of the race immediately. No chance of getting the nom. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Now Carson would be a real black Pres. Obama is a Zebra! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON CARSON CARSON CARSON CARSOOOONNNNNNN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He keeps goofing and alienating more and more people. He wont get the Repubbie nom. Cruz will since Carson continues to do same thing via insanity. Way to pave the way for Clinton, Republicans. You had one job. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is way behind in the polls now anyways. Before this stunt, he is down to 10% while Carson is 30% <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Thats funny I thought he was just doing an impression of Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Republicans finest <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is white trash with money. That basically sums up his behavior throughout this campaign. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
it only looks like he making fun of the fact that the democrat reporter will literally lie about an article he wrote in order to attack trump. at no point did that look like trump was referencing his condition <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and Carson are on their way out. The establishment GOP has announced theyre launching antikook ads. They wont stand by and let the kooks destroy the GOP brand. Trump will get pissed off and go independent remember Ross Perot?. With a 3way general election....Hillary easily takes all the chips. Teabillies commit suicide. All is good. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNNs strategy of race baiting and asking gotcha questions backfired badly here. Im a nonPC but strongly liberal voter who has no love whatsoever for Dr Carson but I walked away from this interview liking him much more than at the beginning of it rather than less I think its hard not to sympathize with a guy who is so obviously trying to be set up and coming through it so unscathed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Seriously who does this moron respect? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Daily reminder that nobody cares about this. Trumps numbers will continue to rise at the same rate that the antiTrump pieces are peddled out by the media. Thankfully, nobody is listening anymore. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If ben carson did this they would probably hang him. Smh kkk <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That wasnt very nice trump but given your the only one that can make America great I will give you a pass on it!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Now watch his polls go up god damn it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BTW. Carson is 100% black. But I guarantee you he is not accepted by the black community 90 %. He is a genuis and very successful neuro surgeon. You would think they would want to embrace him and emulate him but noooo. He doesnt have streetcred. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben Carson is a smart man to say this about gays. thanks for pointing out the truth man, you and trump are smart and hope one of you become president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
are blacks fucken retarded?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like both candidates but trump should maybe admit that Carson is a little more knowledgeable on this subject. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolf is a baiting douchebag! Period! Most CNN reporters are such condescending pricks just for ratings! Dr. Carson is incredibly intelligent man! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is an enigma. Hes the smartest dumbass Ive ever seen. Carson, how will you deal with ISIS? Well, you see, I was the first person to ever successfully separate conjoined twins, so Im kind of an expert on foreign policy and military strategy. God, hes insufferable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a stupid example by Carson here...Because people in prison dont have access to the opposite sex, they get desperate and have sex however they can. I do believe this is also a problem with priests and preachers, no? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a liar, plain and simple. He knows his base is going to support him, no matter what he says. It didnt happen. His supporter have no common sense. Why would there be a new crew in Jersey City filming this while the biggest event in recent US history is unfolding. He said THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS WERE CHEERING. LIES LIES LIES. Even the idiot Ben Carson said he saw it, then next day said it was in the middle east. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

One major issue in politics is people do not acknowledge God.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sanders is atheist and socialist. Only 48% of americans would vote for him. The only way he could win is if the democrat coalition turnout outperform the levels of 2008 and 2012. As a conservative, I apreciate Sanders as person, he really believe in his cause, unlike Hillary. I cheer he gets the nomination because it would be a gift to the GOP candidate. Rubio, Kasich, Jeb and Christie would not feel any burn. Trump or Cruz coul get burned. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders said In fact climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

stupid pointed, loaded questions. They just want soundbites and quotes. fuck CNN what happened to you? Should have never started trying to be like FOX. oh and ben carson is a retard but thats unrelated to this downright stupid conversation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im gay, and Ive never once felt tempted to become straight, despite all the societal advantages that would be conferred on me thereupon. So why on earth do people think that straight people are tempted to become gay? What possible advantage could come from that? Oh, and Carson people who come out of prison gay . . . were gay before they even went in, just not identifying as such. What a loon. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

A desperation to destroy Dr Carson! Still Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have to wonder if he was paid off or planted by members of the GOP. Both Trump and Carson now have secret service protection, so anyone who thinks they can cause trouble, should really think twice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ugly dr <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its an ANALOGY! . Saying that Carson likens some refugees to rabid dogs is like saying that all moose love killing people. Makes sense right? Nope and neither does CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is he ever capable of ever conducting himself with sincerity? One big photo opt. This asshole needs to go. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a liar and a nutjob. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is much further along in his dementia process than Ron Charlie McCarthy Reagan was when he took office. Carson is in denial of HIS neurological problems.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I adore Dr. Carson. Hes no president. But boy just to have his genius and his ability to reason with that kind of intelligence a light going on in a dark closet. Dr. Carson rules. We are indeed blessed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All the white American politicians have been bought by the evil Zionist. Every one of them. From both aisles. Only a BLACK man can save America and take back their country from the Zionist. Obama is just a start. Trump is good...but Carson is the best to lead the fight against the Zionist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow! Dr Carson will be an amazing President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i like ben carson...hes very intelligent tho i wish he were a democrat lol and more concerned with social issues..Id say berniie sanders still blowss him out of the water on most issues though <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN, thank you. I was on the fence. This video has consolidated my opinion on Ben Carson. He should be the next President. And yes, if a qualified Kindergarten teacher wants to carry a fire arm he or she should be allowed to. Yeah CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You guys need to watch the full UNEDITED version of the video. The reporter asked a loaded question and Trumps answer was referring to his border wall. CNN edited the interview. Just watch the full unedited video on MSNBC and youll see what Im talking about. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson is even more low energy...hhaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhhhahahh...this guy is halarious...... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When it is clear from the Polls that only 4 out of these 910 candidates ie TRUMP, Carson,RuBio CruZ have the serious chance of winning the race then I do not understand why rest of the others r keep coming continuing when they himself knew that now they cant make it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It is undoubtedly true that at least some people chose to be gay, and prison proves that. Yes, rape happens in prison. But anybody who has been too or worked in a prison can tell you that Carson, though articulating poorly here, is correct. You can also read the book Concrete Mama, and read prisoners own quotes. Sexuality is learned behavior, and can be unlearned. It is a choice. Desire to procreate is not the same thing as sexuality. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson also believes the pyramids were built to hold grain,lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson needs to lower his oxycontin dose for this one. hopefully the other koch brothersgoldman sachsexxonmobil frauds are wearing their protective belt buckles. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The Media is a peace of junk! Give Dr.Carson some respect! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
go to hell. you and many companies under different names and owned by you filed for bankruptcy after borrowing millions of dollars from banks and never paying back. thats how you became rich and not due to hard work. you crook and you know it and americans are just so stupid to hover around this idiot or that Carson wana be moron. fuck your botox child molesting ugly face <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People, the terrorists are not just in former IRAQ and former SYRIA!!! they are in EVERY nation!!! These American leaders are helping the terrorists and giving them tons of attention. Ben Carson acts like hes barely conscious sometimes!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN likes focusing on the trivial and childish. As Dr. Carson stated, there are more important issues to talk about than semantics and a tweet. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN IS LYING!!!!!!!!!!!!, taking this out of context!!! Ben Carson was referring to the terrorists!!! not the refugees. Listen to the whole talk and you will see!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is totally right and speaks very effectively on not accepting a Muslim president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You see this is what happens when the brain dead control the media....Anybody with an 8th grade education can clearly see that Ben Carson did not compare Muslims or Syrian refugees to Rabid Dogs....He simply made an analogy which compared protecting your children from danger as opposed to allowing them to play unaware that they are in harms way.... This tactic that CNN Yahoo and other liberal media outlets are using is appalling <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN and the rest of the MSM suck. Ben Carson was simply using an analogy to describe things. He wasnt comparing Syrian refugees to rabid dogs. You dont want a rabid dog in your pack, nor do you want a terrorist to slip through with a pack of refugees. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ugh, is this guy still running for president? Im sorry but candidates like this guy makes me think that Donald Trump look like a decent candidate, or it would, but Im guessing Cruz wants to be Trumps running mate because lets face it, does Cruz seriously believe he can defeat Clinton, Sanders, Trump or Carson? No he cannot. Also, Cruz is a Canadian born to a Cuban refugee who came to the US so ... hypocrite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

haha. liberal CNN trying to get a bad reaction from Carson to push Hillarys campaign. nice try. bitches. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN, Im so sick of your unprofessional manner of twisting the truth, blatant dishonesty, and your attempts to mock and discredit Dr. Ben Carson. This is just another irresponsible and pathetic attack from you. It is obviously clear that Ben Carsons analogy is comparing the terrorists that would infiltrate groups of refugees to rabid dogsnot the refugees themselves. Have you no shame? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is sinking in the polls like a rock! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The cnn news anchor looks so stupid Ben Carson will when <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson always puts people in their place regardless of political party. He speaks with such wisdom... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson may sound weak but I bet he has more street smarts and book smarts than any politician running for president. I also like how he didnt play the political correctness with these wack liberal hacks on CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey Ben Carson, the majority of Republican voters think of you as a dumb NI ER or BLack Sambo... so dont be too confident that you even have a minute chance of winning! BuckWheat! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CNN Im against Ben Carson, but this is literally just twisting his words. He didnt say that ALL syrian refugees were dangerous, nor did he imply it. He said that its important to realize that they are not ALL peaceful either. As it is with any group of people. You should be ashamed, you call yourself a news source. Change this title for the sake of your dignity <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ppl dont even know Wolf Blitzers parents are Holocaust refugees, its why he keeps saying THE JWES WERE SLAUGHTERED, U GET THAT RIGHT? and carson is like yeah, but they were politically savvy evil faggots silent agreement NEXT QUESTION Show less <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN IS A PATHETIC DISGRACE. This people are the worst than terrorist. All they think about is to destroy Carson.But God will destroy them soon.only CNN see malice in Bens statements,cos am only halve educated but i dont get it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CNN, is that all you can do? Make these totally silly and unintelligent incoherent attacks? That, or you really need to learn English. Its so obvious that you just dont like Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dear Dr. Carson your number surged because of the hilariously dumb claims you made about hitler, the nazis and 2nd amendment. but the more you stayed in the light, the more you spoke, the more you exposed your lack of intelligence . Even your advisers complained about how stupid you are. so i beg you please drop out , youre too dumb to run for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is out of his mind. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fascist is a better word. Now Trump wants to make all US Muslims register in a database. I think Hitler started something similar on the path to eliminating the Jews. It started with marking their homes and businesses, and ended in a gas shower. This man is really embracing his German heritage. Unfortunately, his insanity is diverting questions about the crazy religious nut Carson, which might actually be worse than Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I love how Carson gently handles haters and instigators. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
good evening mr. Carson don t go with the constitution go for what the Lord say Read Romain 118 to 25 very important God want a man and a woman for the family. i am sorry it is Romain 1. 18 to 35 it is very very clear. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is so disgusting the vitriol leveled at Obama. Im no fan of his, but the venomous rhetoric by the current GOP candidates and some of the posts here, is beyond any normal president bashing. There is a vile undercurrent of racism that is largely ignored by the media. Hes not am American, or Hes a Muslim. its fucking retarded. You may not like his policies, but if you just cant stand to see a black man in charge, just say so. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr Ben Carson is completely correct. Being gay is a choice not something thats biological. Many straight males who go to jail come out gay so what does that tell you? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DR. CARSON for President Donald Trump for Clown <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love Dr. Carson. He exposed a member of the liberal media for what they truly are. They dont like it and neither does their fan section. I am so glad he used their air time, at their cost to do it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
no not this lady <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It would probably be good if Cruz, Santorum, Rubio and Bush to just drop out and take their donor money with them. Not like they stood a real chance against Trump or Carson for the Republican nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A black man with a good education and job is a happy person. Instead, they go public schools that lead right to prison. Give black kids a choice in education. Ben Carson wants to abolish Medicare and MediCal Yes, he already got his welfare and medicaid. Now he doesnt want it for us. Our nation should be deeply embarrassed about this candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the electoral college chooses who becomes the president. not the votera <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I think that Jeb Bush and Ben Carson are making more sense in their speaking. AN this is good thing as they still have more to say in substance. Trump is already exhausted. Trumps poll number will keep falling because he has not future coarse. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Despite hiccups in foreign policy with Syria, Obama has been a great president. America OVERWHELMINGLY voted for him twice. What is an act of lunacy is Ted Cruzs campaign and his fantasy to become President. The country would never vote for a lying nutbag like him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson, you are the best ! What a truly nice gentleman and well spoken intellectual Presidential candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the refugees are not radical muslims they are trying to escape from ISIS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How dare Ben Carson take diet pills, and then say good things about them... This guy is a crook, and then be up front and honest about getting paid to speak at a couple of functions. This guy is too honest for my taste. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont turn the channel when Ben Carson is in the room and dont shoot a spit wad against his face and laugh. You better hope Jesus doesnt unfriend him. Lets all pray the democrats are scared of this religious nut case. Scared straight enough to actually vote for Sanders in the primaries. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson prophetic on the Syrian Refugee Crisis. Now that the Paris Terror attacks happened these CNN libs biting their tongue.EDIT Biting their tongues off. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
While her opening statement was very touching, it will take far more than sympathetic words to stop Islamic State. And its sadly ironic that liberals will be the first to denigrate those people who would act to stop Islamic State, like Trump, Carson, Cruz, etc. With millions of new fightingage Muslim refugees now invading Europe, things will get worse there before they get better. If they get better. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

He later call Putin If he is alive and he said to Putin im Sorry etc. etc etc... Oh damn!!!! Putin??? with more than 3000 nuclear weapons???? Were screwed!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump, I truly ADMIRE YOU FOR THE REAL YOU, I know that people do not trust simply because they do not know you, but if we read your book we have a better idea how you really are, and I truly admire who you are! you are full of values, despite appearances and despite what the media want to make up of your imagen. Just you do not need to take on Dr. Ben Carson. Focus on what you are and the MANY IMPORTANT VALUES YOU ARE BRINGING TO THIS COUNTRY! WE, USA, WE THE PEOPLE, NEED YOU! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Goodness, Dr. Carson, I ADMIRE YOUR RESPONSES SOOO MUCH!!! I truly admire you for not buying and falling into all those stupid media manipulations!

More crazy from Ben Carson, either he is manic, schizophrenic, plus psychotic with delusions of grandeur or he is a combination of all the disorders. Since he hasnt been treated self healed who knows? But what is clear is Ben Carson is off in the head and a cry for help. The sooner they get him out of the presidential race the better. And, to those in Iowa, just because he claims God healed him doesnt mean it happened. Could be another of his delusions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump is such a snake. Trying to take a jab at Carson in a half handed cheap way. Carson was being honest about what he was like as a child and how he was able to turn his life around. Trump is just tying to use carsons own words to his advantage, and acts like hes not a dirty dishonest politition. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Republicans will soon realise neither Ben Carson nor Donald Trump is Presidential material. At the end of the day the American people will never trust the country with an amateur. Hillary Clinton is going to have a field day in the Presidential Debates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I actually like trump but Ii think he is imploding a bit. His last Rant about Carson was a little looney and hes losing credibility with swing voters. IMO...

I think you are on the edge of the cliff now bud. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson actually seems like a viable candidate, its too bad that he has to dumb down to the party he is running in. Dont stoop down to the pink hogs pathetic tactics Carson. You are clearly surging. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
more evidence that Ben Carson is an ameuter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump over carson any day. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson responded and apparently he literally was diagnosed as pathological by a doctor 50 years ago. Ben Carsons on words. I thought Donald Trump was just being crazy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Since Carson admitted to wanting to stab and maim people I dont see why its a big issue that it gets brought up. Carson brought it up himself. There is better news to be found if you pay attention to the rebuilding of America portion of the speech. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is a smart guy. Who cares if chinese are in syria. Lets concentrate on our own problems at home. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WHO ARE YOU GONNA BELIEVE? ...THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND CNN? OR THE INTERNET AND BEN CARSON! ...NOT THAT SNARKY JANE FONDA BIMBO! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shows you how much a lowlife Trump is. Hes obviously feeling the pressure from Carson in the polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson believes in God. Trump believes in money. enough said. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ive read Carsons already published paper on how to deal with China. Its 2 pages long and in only one paragraph he talked about penalties, the rest were just small talk and not substantive. People are informed about the deficit and I think people understand we need to talk about that more than we do now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shows you how much a lowlife Trump is. Hes obviously feeling the pressure from Carson in the polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
O, good. Carson is only highly abnormal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump president and Ben Carson vice president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ive got it! Build the wall around Carson ,and have Carson talk to Trump ,until Trump has no more energy... America wins!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump had it soo Good ! All he had to do was be intelligent, put some practical solutions and he had a good chance. Im switching my vote, hes beyond dumb honestly. Rather support puppets than idiots. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Evangelicals like the feel good story of the negro taking a hammer to his mothers head and then finding Jesus. IF Carson was whitey, his hammer swinging,belt buckle stabbing,etc etc story would not pass muster with evangelicals and the Republican Party would have nothing to do with him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a snake, and Trump is a rat. neither one is good for America. We are on the brink of a World War and a Civil war, and I dont think we can avoid either one, but the best chance we have is Rand Paul, otherwise we are doomed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is starting to work on my nerves. We the American people do not want a fucking clown for a President. I am starting to lean towards voting for Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why am I blocked? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson doesnt give a damn about facts... This is clear across the board. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is this guy high or what? I have faith in American Voters. American voters vote by what the media tells them. So far it has been Trump and Ben Carson. It will be between those two. Media controls it and end of story. Stop being delusional MR. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Them some messy ass reporters. Dumb ass Donald did not compare Coon ass Carsons issue to child molestation, he compared consequences to people with issues. Basically saying how come he got to be phyco and has never been dealt with, while trying to run for president. But Donald is a hypocrite bc hes also a phyco without consequences. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald should be President 2016 but i think he needs to lay off Ben Carson, He is a Respectable Person. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WONDER WHY DONALD TRUMP SAID BEING PATHOLOGICAL WAS A DISEASE ....THAT DNT MAKE SENSE. PATHOLOGICAL IS AN ADJECTIVE. I THOUGHT IT MEANT LIKE A HIGHLY AMOUNT OF DOING SOMETHING... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Come on Donald... Bring to light truth... Then walk on.. Do not fight the sissy fight! Name calling! Leave that for Hillary and Obama You Donald, are better than that! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Perfect in the destruction of Carson attacks mom attacks friend pathological rage attack child. Finito <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson just got got, thank goodness, Carson has Crazy eyes, simmering pathological raise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is a problem, if its true. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
has he read zhe book now or not?? he doesnt even know for himself i guess D <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the next Lincoln. He scares the poo out of the media because he has integrity and doesnt need them to twist our arms to vote for him. Ben Carson 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BUT DONALD! who hasnt put a knife up to someone before? I mean I got suspended in the 5th grade for that too! GOD! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson and Donald Trump are Hillary Clintons best allies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have a nagging suspicion that Trump doesnt know what pathological means. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look at Trumps stupid face.... its like he was wearing a mask when they sprayed on the tan. I hope President Carson sends the IRS in to do an audit on this jerk <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
236 Frankly, I didnt read his book, but according to the book.... Seriously Trump? Youre losing credibility here! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a clinical psychopath, I fear. Surgeon is right up there among the favorite occupations for psychopaths. Scary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:1>
That is going to stick with Carson just like low energy stuck with Bush <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump lost all credibility in this interview the second he said, I didnt read his book. He didnt read his book but he is making all these claims about what the book says.. The same error the media is making. Everyone is just regurgitating what they heard from someone else and Carson has already posted plenty of evidence showing himself to be right on his fb.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a liar. I agree. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a satire of himself. Carson seems burnt out inside. Hillary is the epitome of the self righteous bitch. All theres left is some elderly fellow by the name of Bernie, which is a blend of Bert Ernie. God bless America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is... Sick. Pathologically Sick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is out of his mind and murdered conjoined twins and performed experiments on aborted baby fetal tissue after saying that he was against experiments on aborted baby fetal tissue. Errin is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I dont know why she is not on every segment. Oh my god. oh my god. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OMG whats up with this guy i hope the ppl in America will understand that this is not what we want our country to look like. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
But, would Ben Carson stab Baby Hitler? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sleepy Ass Carson is a bafoon. hes NOT presidential material whatsoever. his biggest fans are evangelical idiots who think everything is. god this n god that. ridiculous. TRUMP IS INTELLIGENT N HAS REAL BALLS TO GET THE JOB DONE. HES A PROVEN LEADER. TRUMP ALL THE WAY <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is fucking insane. he tried to kill his own mother with a hammer. He only attended Yale because of AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
is anyone going to acknowledge how similar this guy talks and sounds just like Carson with his euphemisms, tone and speech patterns... wtf is this... anti Christ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump just committed suicide by attacking Ben. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a weak reporter she is not questioning ANYTHING Trump is saying which would be very easy. The media is using Trump to help their cause of trying to get Carson down. It is so obvious! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
@@@ GO CARSON GO @@@ YOU ARE TOO SMART FOR THE BIMBO IT IS SO SAD TO HEAR CNN BEING THIS WAY .WE KNOW WHO IS PAYING THEM <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
YOU ARE SO GOOD CARSON .NEVER GO ON CNN AGAIN.HILARY WILL LIE HER WAY AND THEY WILL LET HER TALK AND AGREE WITH HER THE BIMBOES <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

yes carson is a serial liar. ive known it since he clawed his way onto the scene. and trumps qualities are the last id ever want to see in a president. as for the rest of the box of crackers known as the gop? the country loses a little bit more credibility and standing in the world everytime any of them opens their mouth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A lot of Carson fans here seem to be rejoicing at the fact he managed to answer a few simple questions, imagine if he was actually asked something tough... maybe something about his pathological lying? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FOX and the REPUBLICANS vs CNN and the DEMOCRATS. Right and red vs left and blue... shit and piss vs pee and poo. Out of all these immature self interest seeking candidates and news reporters.. Carson looks like the only one without diarrhea of the mouth full of insults, and eager to sit down and problem solve without focusing the conversation on a campaign slogan to push an agenda. I dont agree with him on everything... but I have respect for him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont believe Carsons story, but you cant simply say How stupid are the people of Iowa... to believe this crap. He is essentially calling everyone who believes it stupid. Its like with ghosts, I dont believe in ghost stories, but I dont say that whoever does is stupid. I dont know how he has supporters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson wanted to murder his own mother with a hammer...and this thug wants to be president of the US? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If had to pick between the two, Ill chose Trump, Carson is a huge pussy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not voting for trump but he is right Carson sounds ridiculous via @haystacktv <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons too much of a tired pussy to stab anyone. Lying coward wouldnt do shit. Remember the story about him pussificatiously telling the robber at KFC to rob the other guy, not him? Doesnt even look like gangster, looks like that mother fucker on the box of rice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
im a liberal but i do respect trump on this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People dont understand this country wont belong to whites soon. What what I tell u. The land is ruled by laws but if u keep letting immigrants come over and passing laws for them then what u think is next? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons a religious delusional, Trumps a jackass how does the gop attract such losers? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr. trump is a genius.. and people who do not enjoy him are boring.. and he did not say Mexicans are rapists.. he said illegal immigrants have lot of rapists among them because Mexican govt is offloading their criminals on usa.. ok got it? eventually even Hispanics will vote for him. and he will be the President. PS I am not white, nor a republican.. that will give you a clue of what is going to happen in elections. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a serial liar. Trump 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LOL What would we do without these circuses. Carson is a liar. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Also, Im surprised that Trump is trying to put Carsons moral character on the stand when he himself have had three wives! I suppose theres nothing morally wrong with someone upgrading to the newer model, huh?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump needs to watch out, Ben might stab his ass soon! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trumps gone crazy again, and this only helps Carson, who is also crazy, and a religious nut that would welcome Armageddon. Considering the people that are supporting these clowns, maybe we do need a major war to thin out the herd. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When he describes it that way, it does sound absolutely ridiculous <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone other than Carson would be finished once you say you hit your mom with a hammer at the age of 14 they say but who knows maybe he was 20. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When the answer to a question involves saying pathological about 30 times, you know the person doesnt really know what else to say... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Somehow I suspect Trump doesnt really understand what the word Pathological means <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ok Trump we get it, arent u tired of saying the pathological thing? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is the Truth! I think him and Carson should hook up! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson wrote hes pathelogical <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is insane <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a JEW... u really want a JEW control USA? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is right! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is a real black president, period. Dr.Carson is a lying coon. He refuses to acknowledge Obamas faith bc Obamas not a zealot like him. This muthafucka. did u see the coon rap ad he made geared towards black ppl? That smartdumb muthafucka. fuck Republicans AND Democrats. Dems are just the lesser of two evils. ppl who say, All Republicans arent racist are funny. u know how the saying goes. ALL REPUBLICANS ARENT RACIST, BUT ALL RACISTS ARE REPUBLICANS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why does dr. carson always look like he is stoned on something when he is on tv? jump on that donald, demand a drug screen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She doesnt like either answer, lol. Too bad, makes her look like a racist black person, Who let Dr. Carson off the plantation? She has to not like either answer, which cover the apparent range of options, of course, because she hates everyone who doesnt agree with her. So, clearly, she says, Jeb is not prolife and Dr. Carson is just a moron. I assume shes black, its not completely clear, but Id expect this from a black political pundit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So wait a minute. He wont believe Obama in the things that he says about himself. But WE are supposed to take everything that Carson says about himself and his qualifications, with no questions asked. Way to set a double standard on something that you moan and complain so much about Ben. Practice what you preach. Hypocrite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN says Carson and Jeb are losers for answering the question, yet CNN is reporting about it? Just more coverage for Dr. Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need another black president . Vote Ben Carson. Black power. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If I ever need brain surgery, Ben Carson is the last person Id want to operate on me. You see when it comes to brain surgery, Ben Carson is an insider. He has my vote for president though. Hes clueless when it come to that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh come on.... As much as people made fun of his hair He has every right! Geeeeez. Move on! Lets talk Hillary her aid to Benghazi. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They think Carson says strange things, but isnt it a strange question? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson cant say, Thats crazy, Im not going there, to the pyramid question. Thats his question. He brought us there. It is his belief that the Biblical Joseph built the pyramids to store grain for the 7 years of famine. Thats his assertion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Men is smart! I mean Carson, another one is joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need more black faces in the white house, vote for Ben Carson....Greetings from Namibia. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CRUZ, CARSON, and RUBIO are Israel firster far right AIPAC JSTREET puppets. Ru Paul is PRO TPP. CARSON is out of his mind. Not an ounce of sincerity from all of them combined. Just vacant slogans from corporate whores. Shallow and corrupt. Grotesque. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You know I used to like CNN some years back. Not anymore.Ben Carson obviously thought the question was pretty out thereto which he just responded, Im not in favor of aborting anyone.Man, CNN really likes to twist and manipulate peoples words and intentions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Definition of Dickhead Dr.Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im glad he answered the question. First honest thing Ive heard Carson say in a while. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
still waiting on Hitler 2.0..anytime now would be nice <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb would abort, Carson would stab it, Winston would eat it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That first woman diddnt even sound right, She just Carson bashing, the second lady is wide awake. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The fact that Donald Trump and Ben Carson are the primary leads for the republicans is frightening <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson fucking pathological liar <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media has gotten so used to manipulating Conservatives its like they consider them pigs to be slaughtered with lies and got cha questions. All Carson did was cover himself in grease. They cant catch him, so look whos squealing now. The left. Boy, are they pissed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only in people that have a chance against Hilary is Trump, Carson and Rubio Why? because they are exciting and US likes that. If Paul, Cruz or Kasich get the nomination you might as well give the presidency to Hilary Clinton because they dont stand a blue chance in hell to beat Hilary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets be real the only ones that has a chance against Hilary has to be exciting or charismatic. Americans like that, they dont like boring and the same song and dance. Their are only 3 candidates in Republican party that have a slight chance. They are Carson, Rubio and Trump and even against Hilary they will all be underdogs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont love him talking about all the things Carson has been called out on, but this is a competition. People have to remember that. He handle it pretty well I think overall. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson did it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Upto Now Mr Ben Carson was Medias Favourite they were Viewing Him as the Potential Weapon to Stop DonaLd Trump thus were Showing Positive News Reports About Him But the Day Mr Carson Gave a Statement Against the MusLims the Whole Media their Attitude towards Mr Carson Changed 360 Degrees Now from that Day they r Hounding Him Portraying him in Negative Light.........this obsession of MEDIA of keeping the muslim interests above all is really2 MindBoggLing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson can talk about being black all that he wants, hell never be president, not on this planet. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Ben Carson for President 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a liar, CNN is lying and Michelle Ye Hee Lee of the Washington Post is a liars pawn. Pinocchios!? Why dont you just report the news instead of attempting to make it cute? Someone lying to the citizens of this country is not cute in any way, shape, or form. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He really nailed the presstitutes Wolf is, all things considered, a fair interviewer with his hay guys he cant kill us all, lets get him remarks. Ben put it in context and turned it to his favor. Bush, Trump, Cruz, Sanders and espiecially Hillary are unelectable, they all have a high percentage of voters that htfg. A compromise candidate is required and not another established politician. That candidate may very well be, Dr Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not sure the American voters are necessarily looking for a factbased president. Carson has always been out of touch with reality this merely highlights the fact. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Youre not doing yourselves any good, people at CNN, with these interviews. As Carson stated many many times, this subject of this interview was a WASTE of time. Lets talk about what really matters with a presidential candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
K.O. Ben Carson 1 CNN 0 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a bitch. She starts out kissing up, then hiccupped from any decent dialog about the economy to all the bullshit about his book, finally comparing her questions to vetting Dr Ben Carson? #1.

trump is not presidential in any sense of the word. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not petty, small minded, and supposedly so intelligent Donald Trump should be threatened? Is he talking about the same Ben Carson who said the Egyptian pyramids were solely made to store grain? The one who said he knows being gay is a choice because Straight people go to jail straight and come out gay? He my be very intelligent when it comes to surgery, but other than that its clear hes not intelligent enough to understand what the majority of Americans want. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a schizophrenic lying negro. hopefully he doesnt stab anyone tonight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Ben Retardson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is not viable so even if Carson was first way ahead, this all means good news for Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not THIS American... I dont trust him as a person nor do I trust his judgement. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson would just stab the president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The Democrats protect women rights? No way! There is a double standard between how femaleblack conservatives are treated compared to liberal femaleblacks.

Poor Carson, smothered and flat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson it proves that joseph built the pyramids to store grains Trump I have a tremendous respect for the egyptians, I will make them build the wall JEB I can fix it Christie were talking about pyramids? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
maybe it is that grain Carson is talking about. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson needs to see a real neurosurgeon to fix that crazy head of his... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wtf Ben Carson could be right about that stupid grain theory! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THE MAIN THING TO GET OUT OF THIS VIDEO IS THAT 911 WAS A FALSE FLAG AND NOW WE HAVE A PSYCHO LIKE BEN CARSON RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson I told you so. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im voting for Donald Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
President Trump, NO two words go better together! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
as a liberal.. i agree with carson. This level of detail into anyones life would show things that may not have proof or evidence, etc... And of all the acchivements carson has made... those are the holes found in his story??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is just trying to sell his book about his fake life story.His campaign is just for publicity. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a pussy. Thats what everybody says. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whats a matter Carson, cant get your stories straight? Maybe that mannatech is messing your brain up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey Ben Carson get over it.. You wanna be president then you better telll your whole life story.. dont be shy bitch <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON IS THE MAN !!!!!!!!!!!!! I CANT WAIT FOR THE DAY WHEN HE BECOMES THE PRESIDENT HE WILL REPRESENT US IN SUCH AN INCREDIBLE WAY AROUND THE WORLD. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its scary how some people dont believe in Dr. Carson but believe in CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is shit on a stick. They never say what the relationship is. Doing the little speeches isnt the relationship CNN imputes to Carson. And Carson is an ass bite. You can tell when hes fudging the truth, he closes his eyes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is just crazy, he said no one else has been vetted like him and they didnt do it to Obama, around kidding me?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Santorum would be great. But i prefer Carson or Trump. We need to reduce immigration to protect our national security and make wages rise when there is less labor in the market. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So far there are NO EVIDENCES anywhere that Carson is lying only suspicions based on people who cant remember and a lack of proof!! Incredible that it is accepted that the media operate like that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And trump would fuck his own daugher. Media trying to kill trumps competition. Carson and Riubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There was conspiracy under discussion and is not acceptable also Obama all manipulated my data like no cattle carson fraud and I say that God loves and all London and the results after the gay who are clean of sins but usually continue their partners swim through contact with other people only its partners will thus definitely to be cleaned so his sin until they die <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for the win Obama for the firing squad. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Merry Christmas Starbucks Courtesy #Trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson whines about how life isnt fair while ignoring the fact that Obamas past was covered endlessly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson would be a real President. God bless him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sorry Carson, nothing against you personally, but TRUMP 2016!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Let the prolife crowd know that Jeb Bush is a baby killer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Because Ben Carson is not a very good speaker, it is harder to believe what he is saying. It is hard to believe he is really speaking from what he knows, but rather some canned answers. Words like silly, seating on the butt, stupid, and smoking cigar. Hopefully, his strategists are getting him groomed fast. Unfortunate! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I missed saying Marry Christmas and Im not Christian. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great story! I always knew Ben Carson was a crook. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
VOTE FOR BEN CARSON <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They are such liars they are not even listening to what he is saying!!!!!!!!!!!! They are trying to be so Politically Correct! They are really threatened By Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The two top republican candidates are crooks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is another non story thank you Anderson Cooper for wasting nine minutes of my time. funny how they cant find dirt on the doctor so they try to create a story. I hope they will be as critical to Hillary Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN did not discredit Carson. Why are they trying so desperately? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a dunderhead interviewer. She never listened to anything Dr. Carson had to say. Probably because she was too distracted to advance her own agenda in the interview and make him look bad. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the best candidate out there <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carsons reputation will stay true to his real nature. He is a good man. I can tell. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
73% Christians? Lmao Churches are fucking empty. Majority goes once a year and maybe if theirs a wedding. United States is secular country, stop this madness. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He lies? I guess hell fit right in with the GOP after all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OK....given Carson the benefit of the doubt.....if he is not lying about trying to stab his best friend oh wait....he changed that to a family member if I remember correctly, and he admits trying to attack his mother I believe it was with a hammer, and the other things at school that were violent, then tell me one thing, why has he not been arrested for not 1 but several attempts to commit murder???? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im voting for Donald Trump for President of the United States <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
620 Dr. Carson, sorry somebody was speaking to me. lol!!! She meant My puppet master was trying to correct the direction of my interview. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson supports gun control, amnesty, TPP and puerto rican statehood. Hes an obama clone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I just got in to this. so the accusation was that Carson was lieing about he is stabbing someone and that he is a much nicer person? so confusing... is this similar to the case where bill clinton and Lewinsky incident. he should goto jail if he swore in the court that he stab someone and he did not. or is the media arguing that he should have gone to jail for the crime he has committed? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
#Trump for President! Interesting, if I remove the Socialist media machine, like NBC, CNN, FOX, ABC and CBS from the polls, Trump is almost double points ahead of Carson. I wonder why? elections.huffingtonpost.compollster2016nationalgopprimary#!hiddensubpopsA,RVestimatecustomhiddenpollstersnbcsurveymonkey,fox,cbstimes,abcpost,nbcwsj,cnn,cbs,nbmarist,pppd,pppd <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
More reasons to vote for this man in my opinion. Now my mind is made up. Carson 2016. The media will do anything to tarnish the reputation of an upright American. Hes so clean, lets desperately get some dirt on him. Epic FAIL! Lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
GOd bless you Ben Carson! I love you to death! This is great pulls out popcorn <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Ben Carson is not as smart as the media think he is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is going to be a fantastic President. I love that he isnt afraid to say what were all thinking. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mainstream media UnAmerican PRAVADA! This is nothing but an an attempt to discredit Dr. Ben Carson because they disapprove of his Conservative convictions. Members of the leftist disinformation media are attempting to destroy Ben Carson through LIBEL SLANDER DISINFORMATION outright LIES! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To the critics Google Parade Magazine 1997 where they interviewed his mother who tells the story of Carsons temper and the knife incident. Then stop spreading your lies like the media, we are smarter than you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets just state a fact. Lets just put it out there. I absolutely think Ben Carson has no chance in winning the republican nomination. Republican party will not elect him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sorry Alisyn Camerota, youre not the sharpest knife in the drawer. Listen to what the guy is saying. But just like there was hope for Ben Carson, there is hope for you! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is stupid. There. I said it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr.Carson showing some fire in the belly and hitting a deceitful agenda driven media square between the eyes! Get em Ben! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even if Carson doesnt win the presidency, what he is doing to the media is borderline historic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson.. Exactly Right! And the A Hole liberal left media.. Snakes and Liars. .. Hmm. Was this on the news at all? Probably not cause you have to keep your dumb Zombies in the dark. Like always. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
damn dr carson stood there like a boss <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

So trump rips his slogan make america great again from Reagans lets make america great again... and Jeb rips his slogan Jeb can fix it from Bob the Builders Can we fix it?. This just in... Carly Fiorina announced her new slogan is I love you, you love me and Ben Carson is just napping but Im sure when he wakes up hell have a good one. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is very ultraconservative taliban he will criminalize the free abortion , he will criminalize the divorce , the will criminalize all the birth control pills and all the condom based in his adventist Bible <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016 Stop being mean to me!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im waiting for Carson to play the race card <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is despicable. This reporter starts off with such a thick layer of fake enthusiasm, you could cut it with a knife. She gets way too emotionally involved with the interview to be taken seriously. Kudos, lets move on. Dr. Carson 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i always said if Blacks want something done in America quit sports and stop consumption for 1 month. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN IS NEARLY AS RACIST AS CMSNBC. BOYCOTT THESE RACIST PIGS THAT GAVE HALFWHITE OBAMA A PASS ON VETTING BUT VET THE SHIIT SIC OUT OF DR. CARSON BECAUSE THEY DONT WANT TO SEE NO FULL BLOODED BLACK MAN IN THEIR WHITE HOUSE. BROTHERS AND SISTERS ASK YOURSELF WHAT THEY DONE FOR YOU? THEN TURN THE CHANNEL. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson just owned this idiot. I wonder what life was like when we had real journalists? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Watch out! Carson might try to stab you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good example why common people with sense see right through the hypocrisy of the media. Thank you Ben Carson for standing your ground. It is a shame that more people dont see that the main stream media is nothing more than the right arm of the democratic leftist party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Geez, what a kiss ass for Carson this guy is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is lying................................................... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson doesnt seem he can handle the pressure of tough questions. Theyre only questions Carson, just questions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson thinks the media is wasting too much time on these nonissues that dont affect any American lives, and thinks they should spend all their time investigating Benghazi. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sanders Clinton Voted NO to the patriot act Voted YES to the patriot act Voted NO to bailing out the banks in 2008 Voted YES to bailing the banks out in 2008 Voted NO to starting the war in Iraq Voted YES to starting the war in Iraq Which candidate do you think has the peoples best interest in mind? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im torn. I like Carson, but I like a different candidate more. I want Carson to do well, but not as well as my candidate of choice. What do I do? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is numinously nuts but I do agree with his stance on foreign policy, at least he has balls and will stand up to Russia instead of letting dictator Putin further entertain his expansionist exhibitionist ideals, a proper black president...not like Obama bin laden. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nobody read Obamas books and scrutinized them. Carson has a point. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson sounded like a whining baby. Inarticulate to boot. How can this weak mind be leading. I predict a rapid demise for him. By January 1, hes out of the race. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dear Dr. Carson Please do not use valuable air time to compare yourself to B.O.! You are much better than this. What you say may be true however it is quickly becoming irrelevant! Stick to the here and now and the future of America..... you can do something about that! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson isnt interested in the truth, or facts, or evidence. As long as you BELIEVE. Wait. Are we talking about HIS book or the bible? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
dude, I see cnn and other media outlets scrutinizing the stupidest bullshit about carson. its crazy. they have nothing on him so theyre trying to make shit up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is getting desperate haha #Carson2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WTF! I am Asian and its clear to me what Carson is talking about. she is playing stupid with her job. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont want a liar for my president. Ben Carson cant even keep up with all the lies being found out. I think hes a stupid man to insult so many educated voters. Hes giving black folks a bad reputation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is just way too smart for retards like CNN, Politico, Trump... Carson2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Isnt that reporter that same racist lily white bitch that refused to vet Obama because he was OK since he was halfwhite but she goes after Ben Carson with a vengeance because she dont want no black man in her White House. CNN HAS SHOWN THEIR TRUE COLORSCNN IS NOT LESS THAN A RACIST HATE SPEWING NETWORK OF LIARS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like how Dr. Carson confronts reporters who just want to focus on gotcha questions instead of the questions that focus on important issues America faces today. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson said that Gays made Ancient Rome fall.What a retarded lie dude... he is a dangerous man <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Finally, somebody calling the liberal media out on their ridiculousness! Go, Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a joke!!! If he cant handle the press he wont have a chance at being president!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
great job Dr Carson. thanks for keeping calm compared to Trump. keep the moral high ground and stick to the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson freaks out, right wing nutjobs eat it up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
these situations with the media are causing you to surge in the poles...so take heart Dr Carson what the enemy has ment for harm will be your victory <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson shutting down bias media <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He doesnt remember Obama being criticized when he was running? They criticized his name, his birth record, his church, his smoking habit, his vacation pictures, etc. Its no surprise Carson doesnt remember any of that, seeing as how he looks like he just woke up from a nap. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
America would be BLESSED to have Ben Carson as president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson didnt lie at ALL. That lady up there is so uninformed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is unbearably stupid. No wonder the Republicans love him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As carson said if you are a negro that leaves the liberal plantation theyll come after you and lynch you.So glad this dirty, hideous creature got intellectually rapes by Ben carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is such an imbecile. If I was the journalist I wouldve called the interview quits. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

can we see carsons school record? all of it? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oops, Politico had to retract their fabricated hit piece on Dr Ben Carson. Now, when will the media question Hillary for her letting Americans die in Benghazi, then lying to us and then throwing an innocent youtube maker in jail? You want to talk about actual lies involving the deaths of patriotic Americans, lets start there. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is truely insane <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is in fact a Dr. of Neurology. Dont loose hope in our country just because we were lied to. Taxes will go down, business demand will go up people will have more needs and services to go around. People make more money when the Republicans take over. Same thing. 911 was the bum deal. And they wont eliminate needed programs irresponsibly. But, Obama care doesnt really provide much for much better than it normally was. In fact, didnt costs go up in some scenarios? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only candidate worth voting for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Way to go Dr. Carson!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Good for you, Dr. Carson. Dont allow the media shove you around. Especially the Bozos on CNN. #BENCARSON2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson isnt even a politician. This is why people are skeptical. He comes off as a complete idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I notice this interview is not about letting people know what Carson is about but to make sure he is on the same page with Blitzer. I remember Blitzer since I was a teenager, presidents come and go, but he doesnt, maybe its time he did, since it seems his stories are more about himself now than the subject. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The more I listen to Carson Im impressed with him and the more I listen to #CNN, the more I despise them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i will vote for rand. he is the most presidential in all areas. no fluff about him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Meanwhile, Obamas biography in Literary Agent in which he tells everyone he was born in Kenya was dismissed as literary license just after Obama sealed his personal records as his first act as President to halt investigations LOLOLOL. CNN is completely a character assassination network. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson constantly trying to prove he stabbed someone for street credibility lmao! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jake Crapper doesnt know the difference between a lie and an embellishment. He should call Brian Williams, that guy lost his job and career and Hillary gets a pass. Shame on you Jake, you are the problem. Jake, after you talk to Brian, open up a dictionary. Your use of the word embellishment for Hillarys strange lie is laughable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson has absolutely nothing to learn from this. He told his story. The media is trying to find inconsistency thats not there. Why would he change what he saying when all he does is speak the truth, with honesty, and integrity. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Every presidential candidates foreign policy is a NEOCON foreign policy. except for Rand Pauls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson and I can certainly agree on one thing The media stinks at their jobs in large part. Its everything else after that Im having a hard time seeing eye to eye with him on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is right to challenge that unseen asshole reporter who, rather than rise to the challenge about why he and his liberal colleagues, show no appetite whatsoever for investigating, or even pursuing Obama, about his murky past, or his sealed record. I hope these liberal hypocrites dont manage to damage the decent, intelligent man Carson is, because of all those running for office, he has the most integrity <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I respect Ben Carson, but when he says stuff like the pyramids were for grain storage and the founding fathers didnt have federal political experience, he keeps shooting himself in the foot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is crazy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And why arent all the anti Carson people being singled out as racists? If there was one question about Obama in 2008 that word was a household word. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes not informed well enough to make good judgements, hence the fact that he often talks so much nonsense. Ben Carson may not be stupid, but he doesnt have very good luck when he thinks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
SUCH BS SCRUTINY....ONLY because BEN CARSON has INTEGRITY!!! ALL the BUSHs, CLINTONs and OBAMAs need to be INCARSONATED INCARCERATED....JAILED for all the low information voters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is too out of touch to be a good leader of the U S <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What the liberal media clowns dont realize is the more they attack Dr. Carson, Donald trump etc.. it just brings more people out to vote for them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So, Ben Carson lied, and did not acknowledge it, is the story. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That convinced me to vote for Hillary, because Carson is a christian and a liar and I really want Russia to become the number 1 military power of the world and Iran to have a nuclear weapon and if they happen to nuke Israel, bad luck I guess. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not a huge Carson supporter but what Politico did was pretty pathetic. We all know the smear games have started but when you smear your rival try to actaully smear them on a fact Dems. If this is the best you can do then fuck, we might have a GOP sitting in that office in 2016. Think about that one as long as you need too... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Whimpers about the witch hunt... immediately starts suggesting a NEW witch hunt as to why obamas education record is sealed... so he doesnt hate witch hunts, he just doesnt want to be the witch, he wants to be the hunter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
he needs to drop out! even Kanye would make a better Pres than Carson tbh <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rand Paul would probably get done 10 times as much as obama in half the time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson you are the worst public speaker in the world... TELL ME TELL ME O shut up you fucking asshole <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rip them a new AHOLE Ben! Ben Carson has my vote now! The media in this country has been exposed! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson appears to be telling the truth. He was offered a scholarship by a West Point recruiter. West Points website today states the words scholarship. Carson was also offered a scholarships to Yale and many other schools. If West Point uses the word scholarship TODAY to describe the benefits of the institution, what seems to be the problem? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is right ... the liberal media is unfairly targeting Ben Carson and refuses to deal with the big issues facing America today ... the liberal media does need to be told off and held accountable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Watch out. Carson might try to stab you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Owned them. The media lies and Carson is smacking them <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He claims in his book that he met and had dinner with General Westmoreland, who supposedly offered this scholarship in Detroit on Memorial Day 1969. But records apparently indicate that Westmoreland was in Washington D.C. Memorial Day 1969. It was even noted that he was playing Tennis at 645 P.M. So is Carson also lying about actually meeting him? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson said that he tried to stab someone during an interview with CNN whilst running for president and also claims that God speaks to him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even if you take Carsons past for real, thats even worse. I dont want a killer to be a president of any nation... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Do you really want a president killer, America? You want a president crook. Vote Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson getting exposed.... with words like pathological psycho <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why do I like Ben Carson so much? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I just visited some far right websites like niggermania and chimpmania where conservative far right racist whites had all kinds of names for Ben Carson including porch monkey, nigger etc. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a complete idiot this carson is.If he could not handle a small issue like this without looking like a buffoon....how is he gonna handle Iran,Russia,syria ,isis, the Chinese, Benghazi.He isnt cut out to be president and this press conference clearly shows he is not the type to represent the country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN believes if they prove Carson is a liar, then everything he says about mainstream media is also a lie. Its blatant bullshit. Dont fall for it. See CNNs desperation. See their corruption <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Ben Carson!!!! Call them out and keep it up!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson owned that bitch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson is a moron <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God Bless you Ben Carson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Were Carson familiar with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, he would know that federal law protects the privacy of all students educational records and that his own educational records would also be protected, only to be released to the public if he opted to do so. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats exactly right. Go get him Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have news for you, CNN. This controversy concerning Dr. Ben Carson is an invention. Its an invention by people who have total contempt for the intellectual capacity of WE THE PEOPLE. You are bottomfeeding, scumsucking vermin. WE THE PEOPLE are not buying your bullshit. It is you, CNN, Fox, NBC, ABC, CBS, MSNBC, Politico, that have our utter and complete contempt. We will make up our own minds and not be manipulated by your obvious sophistry. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is loony tunes! Trying to do Trump and failing. Come on people! You have to see it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson 2016!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thumbs up for Ben Carson!!!! CNN should be ashamed. No more swaying the political system liberal media!!! The American people have had enough of your BS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its hilarious how CNN actually posted this when theyre one of the news outlets that did this to Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Some one once told me that medical doctors are the most ignorant people, since at college they only take medical classes. I did not believe him until I heard BC speak. He dislikes Evolution yet medicine has used it for what seems like ever now. Then the whole Joseph is Imhotep thing which not only has been disproven eons ago, but does not even match up chronologically. He is done... I love what I read about him once... Urkel all grown up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben Carson has never heard about the birth certificate scandal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yah Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mrs. Carson has about 2 months to get herself together #extrememakeover1stladyedition <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He wasnt putting anyone in their place he was just being a whiny child. If he cant take these type of questions then he shouldnt be running for President. Oh and look at this CARSON CAMPAIGN ADMITS TO FALSE CLAIMS AROUND WEST POINT ADMISSION andeconomicscarsonfalseclaimswestpointadmission?tspid2utmcontentinf10942 <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good for Carson that other guy and that lady are clueless . Carson is totally right, there is a PC police cult mentality and its really an epidemic. Look how many people bully you in the media if you disagree with the establishment. Its in a social middle school way too, no real logic to back up their actions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obamas left pinky has more charisma than Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If hes this thin skinned now just wait. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These media are crazy. Dr.Carson was top of class and black. It is highly possible that the general Westmoreland told him if he applied and there should not have a big problem. These media have the time to attack Dr.Carson but no time for Hilarys email scandal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Republicans bitch about the race card, until their minority candidate gets scrutinized for lying and then its all about how the other sides minority didnt get it this bad. Ben, Obama had it worse. You are unfit to lead if you cant be honest and cant handle criticism from journalists. You couldnt even handle a debate. You are not a leader. You are a loser. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is a murderer lmbo! Murdering these media figure heads who have no clue the curtain is falling <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson...fresh out the clown car. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Watching this again I Actually feel sorry for her since she is clearly very sincere, but those guys behind the scene are the ones employing her as the puppet. She is not as obnoxious as it appears to be as this is reflected in her apparently composed demeanor, despite being under strong pressure. What an ignominious attempt at exploitation of poor coworker! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben creationist Carson is becoming unhinged. He shouldve never run for president. This guy is a pathological lunatic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
someone tells him Mr Carson, I think you can get a Noble peace prize Carson, a few years later I was offered a Noble prize for peace, but as honoured as I felt, I decided to turn it down Lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn. I just realized Ben Carson is fucking legit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is a class act. He would make a fine president to. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
libs simply detest a intelligent christian who is not afraid to call the mainstream out on there bs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont remember Obama scrutiny? Hes not christian hes a muslim He hates america and is from another country? REALLY FOOL?? Stop crying and suck it up like Hillary had to for 11 hours! What a cry baby! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I noticed that they cut out a lot of this interview from Ben Carson. I wonder Why they did not show the Whole interview ?! I wish that they had. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson Stolen Valor. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson makes the media go crazy. Finally someone with the courage to speak to them like the spoiled rotten children that they are. I thought Alisyn was gonna cry. Poor thing trying to listen to her producers in her ear and trying to trip up Carson. He made a damn fool out of her. GO BEN! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont even want Ben Carson for president, but holy crap are people tripping over themselves to look for dirt on him. And then theres Politico, who appears to have outright lied several times about this whole thing. Unbelievable how little integrity our media has. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is a joke. he blatantly tries to shift the focus from his own issues its so hilarious <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson you are pathetic. Ben Carson has the same initials as Bill Cosby. Guess which one is the rapist? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a liar he cast and makes up stories for all these people dont be fooled people! and if you look at him trying to defend himself from these medias attacking him from 15 direction he looks like carson cant take it! THIS IS NOT GREAT LEADERSHIP! Was with carson Now for Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson calling out the liberal double standard in the media <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Onetwo punch POW, POW! Get em, Dr Carson! I think Politico just boosted him campaign for him! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have said from the beginning, Dr. Ben Carson is too honest for this game of politics, as is Donald Trump although the latter walking a different line, but both will never take a bribe. Point being here, this is the Media who are like the devil prowling around looking for dirt, and that is why they cannot and will not answer a straight question lets face it, they are paid big money to say what they are told to say...and we must realize this concerning all topics. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Put the media on their head! Good job Ben Carson! Ben Carson for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I imagine CNN is hoping this will show some sort of dark side of Ben Carson. In reality, they are digging their own grave and the graves of the dishonest media in general. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what an ambush..Dr. Carson, youre doing very well in the polls... now, your book doesnt match our investigation, why did you lie? this Alysin Camerata is an emptyheaded whore... no wonder Fox News fired her ass. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Carson Missile On Target...Cnn, media and liberals on suicide watch <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Pretty sad that the media has to look up a video thats 20 years old to find something to ridicule him for. they could just look at current obama and Hillary to get the same kinds of things. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if this fucking idiot cant even take care of his finances, then how the fuck is he going to take care of americas finances?? he would make a terrible president for many reasons. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Ben Carson. Black people need to stop asking, and start working. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yea, Ben is so dumb, cuz these broads have PhDs too huh. they probably save more lives than Ben too. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
1 Trump better for the Nation. 2 Dr Carson better for the people 3 Sanders better for the country. The rest are jokes!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is brilliant. He dodges the petty attempts to reduce a serious discussion into a dramatic debate about word preferences. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If youre black and not a liberal, this happens. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ultimately what I get from this is If you cant stand the heat Mr. Carson, get out of the kitchen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I do not remember this level of scrutiny for one President Barack Obama when he was running, Is this man nuts. President Obama is still under INTENSE scrutiny. Simply this man is a liar. You can tell by his speech pattern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The gaystream media is made of nothing but fail! They stopped doing their jobs decades ago. Nice to finally see some fight in Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so what happens to this reporter who reported that false story about ben carson? I hope he gets fired! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Now I know why Carson does not speak forcefully more often. Because he sounds like a squeaky mouse, that voice would make a good cartoon character. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love working watch this little toad sink into oblivion. I also love watching his absolutely moronic followers defend him. Pass the popcorn while Hillary or Bernie laugh all the way to the white house. .. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben carson is an idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
SO many stupid people supporting Carson. America is doomed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Media are a paper tiger. Carson gets it. Everyone else seems VERY DUMB. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bravo to Mr. Carson for calling out the media on their hypocrisy. No one watches CNN or MSNBC any more so they have to go way way out on a lie to get any ratings. Then when they are called it on it, they yell racism. YET IT is them that are the racist. And Mr. Carson points that out quite well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben also lied about meeting Gen. Westmoreland. Ben Carson is a clown <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolf didnt seem too aggressive to me. The guy is a reporter. Its his job to get the news and ask tough questions. Those were rather softballs and Carson handled hisself well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson, the issue is not being Black. It gets down to intelligent reasoning which you as a brain surgeon should understand. Its rather unsettling that you dont understand. There is for example your claim about the pyramids which you trumpet as facts but are only based on your belief systems. You know what Im talking about. Your claim that the pyramids were built by Joseph to store grain. Karl Rove is making a fool of you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is still on this subject? Really? I know why though. Donald Trump is a plant by the Hillary campaign so she can win. Hillary controls some of the media, and I bet shes behind this story being prolonged. Carson is a threat to Trump right now and she will do anything to make sure Carson is not the nominee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow... way to go Carson. I am so sick of the media making up stories instead of just reporting them. I dont care if its liberal or conservative bias. Bias is bias and the extent that nearly all the news agencies practice it has no place in any organization that calls itself a news source or outlet. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson 100 Media 0 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson might be developmentally disabled... Wow. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Dr. Ben Carson! Youre a kind and accomplished human being. The media is just trying to do anything it can to destroy you. Keep going good Doctor. This country needs a man with your integrity and insight in the Presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I get that in Dr. Carsons alternate universe there is an alternate truth. But for those of us living in reality... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So, some people talk to Carson about attending West Point, pointing out that West Point is a full scholarship for all who are admitted. Ben decides he wants to go into medicine, and says thanks, but no thanks. Politico reports that West Point says it has no record of any application to attend. Uhm, isnt that what you would expect from someone who turned down your offer? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn Carson is dumb! What an airhead. Low energy, weak. This guy cant deal with China, cant deal with anything! Tell us about the Pyramids benadryl Ben! Hahahaha What a dumbass!! lolol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016, lying thugs need not apply. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow Carson is a pathological liar!! Trump2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Keep up the truth Dr. Carson..I see the lies and corruption in the Media.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its hard to believe that anyone watching this would not conclude that Carson is severely damaged goods. The man clearly needs psychiatric help. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a mess <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh...and....when the press answers Carsons question and he doesnt like the answer....he just keeps saying the same question over and over..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson claims that he was once a violent thug, stabbing a close relative then trying to use a hammer on his own mother. If he wanted to confess his sins so bad, why couldnt he have gone to a priest? Just what we need, an unstable mad doctor running the country. Ben Carson is sounding more and like a mental patient the whenever he opens his mouth and speaks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is right, mainstream media is horrible <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
gotta like this guy...I also noticed that no one in the press was willing to answer HIS question...pretty telling, isnt it? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What does Ben Carsons Adventism really believe about the death of Christ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He says this things because of Religion ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RIP, Carsons political career. Using sarcasm and attacking the press reveals his most wonderful weakness! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016! NO MORE CORRUPT POLITICIANSMASS MEDIA <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson cant handle one interview without emotion on CNN, he cant handle international relations. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate Carson but....omg that was brilliant. That was more than what I thought hed say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well said, Dr. Carson! Intelligent people can understand what a person is trying to express not but you use this word or Im quoting what you said or Im playing back what you said. If you cant understand the point, and youre stuck on certain specific words, then you really are stupid! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This interview has nothing to do with vetting. This is all about trying to expose Dr. Carson as a liar. Vetting was the furthest thing from her mind. And she lies several times in this interview. Who in his right mind believes that the traitor Obama or Hillary Cackles Clinton wereare treated this way by these jerks? Im extremely sick of these interviewers masquerading as journalists. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FUCK BEN CARSON <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck you Trump. Go get a different hair stylist while youre at it. Carson 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
pathetic....carson is a joke <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Notice how she had the Bible verse written down, ready to use for this interview, hoping to use the good book Im wondering how often she actually reads it. to back up the liberal agenda. Dr. Carson turns the tables on her by also using the Bible to make his point. I love it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media spent years criticising opponents of Obama as being racist. Ironic that theyre now trying to smear Carson as being an angry violent black youth. The media, particularly CNN have mastered the act of race baiting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I was never a big fan of Carson as a candidate but now I know hes got potential, it takes courage to speak truth to power and hes doing it. Tump would do better to applaud him as opposed to piling on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This just in Twins not even siamese until Carson got involved. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is awesome. I want to go how obama got into colombia with really bad grades as Id also like to go to an ivy league uni as I got bad grades. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
youre a real weakling Carson.....you get bagged lying and then you try blaming the press.. what a weak move by Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You have to go out there and be a ferocious tiger! Remember, Ben, youre super tough and energetic! Go Convince these morons youre qualified to be the next president! Carson Campaign Manager <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies. Carson is so full of shit. Yes, dummy not one single person questioned Obamas past. Not one. Nobody questioned his education, his upbringing. FFS, these jokers spent years challenging Obamas BIRTH. What a joke this party has become. The GOP is a party of cowards, liars and grifters leading a base of willful ignorance and hatred. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Brilliant Dr. Carson!!! Well said!!! And yes there are a lot of stupid people!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Actually, its not important his opinion is right or wrong. The more important thing is we can feel Carson really has been thinking so deeply and trying finding answers of many problems inside of US now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh the irony. On the one hand, society becoming more progressive think, primarily, of the civil rights movement paved the way for a black President. On the other, its this progressivism which will make sure that illiterate, backwards thinking backwater sewage like Ben Carson will never become President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN get a life. Carson is the best candidate. Im sick of this CNN bullshit. no one is perfect. Carson will continue to fight this evil call cnn <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Congratulations for holding Ben Carson and his poorly supported comments accountable. CNN is brave for holding this nitwit to his words. Like she said Dr. CarsonYou said it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whats funny is, now should we label all those journalists, racists? After all, Ben Carson is black, thus, any criticism against him should be racism, right? Thats what the rules were for Obama .. still are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a complete fucking moron. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What youre not going to find with me is someone who will sit back and let you be completely unfair without letting the American people know whats going on Dr. Ben Carson, Go ahead President Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hell yeah, fuck science, Ben Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama was a constitutional law senior lecturer at University of Chicagos Law School. You dont become a professor at an Ivy League school with an okay academic record. Republicans have been calling him a Muslim questioning his birth certificate since day 1. Carson doesnt even want the media the question his former classmates about his angry issues because everyone of them say they didnt perceive him in that manner at all it was a lie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
go trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
finally a candidate that doesnt take the medias BS. lets go Dr. Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

God bless Mr.Carson!! I encourage all my christian brothers to be praying for this descent man, his a good man, honorable and he can be a good president... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HAHA. Jews control the media. Carson knows. But dare he speak out, hes a gonner... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media is trying everything they can to take down Carson. Theyve failed so much, now theyre digging for anything <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Sounds like Carson is starting to crack under the scrutiny of the media. He has his followers, but hes not convincing anyone that this is a witch hunt. theyre basically trying to frame him as a liar and hes getting defensive. politicians lie, but hes not a politician so hes not good at it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great job Dr Carson say to their faces just a bunch of silly adults. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Making mountains out of molehills. Im not even necessarily on the Carson camp, but these are bullshit attacks on the guy compared to Obama, or even Clinton or Sanders. The bias in the media is insane. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson makes the media his bitch. Take notes CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Once again Mr. Carson speaks up to the press. Why didnt this media individual ask these kind of questions to Obama about his college? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mainstream media still trying to dig up dirt on Carson and getting frustrated that nothing is sticking lol.. Journalism just hit its lowest point.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Good for Ben Carson glad to see it has it in him and happy when ANYONE running for office stands up to the rude individuals in the press! Ben just needs to jack it up about a notch higher! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You tell em Dr. Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Carson who cares about his past fuck the past we need to be concerned about today and tomorrow.. I feel like him and trump get some satisfaction from controversy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the perfect hate fest for the media. Hes a black republican and worse of all he is a christian, gasp. I think the later is probably more annoying to the media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
they have awoken a sleeping dragon <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How come all your childhood contacts couldnt believe their ears when told you tried to stab someone? You were a nerdy bookworm. Now youre a fraud. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hehehhe G1 Go Carson Go!!! edit Oooooo! I was wide awake in 2008 . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why the attack on Carson over something so fucking small. The media is acting as if he lied about his medical career. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Seems like the Press really wants to see the angry black man side of Carson. Remember he said he let that go, so dont push it people!!! nger, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Theyve let out the wolves. Lets see if Dr. Carson can bring down the whole pack. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youre still a liar. West Point has no scholarships, so how could someone offered one? And those pyramids? Jesus man, quit already!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Haha were all waiting for the next president who will fuck the U.S. Special if trump or Carson get elected ... Haha doomsday is coming <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben putting the media in their place! Holy shit i love this guy!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson isnt my candidate of choice, but even IF he lied about getting accepted into West Point which isnt entirely clear to me at this point, does anyone honestly care? I feel like the media is trying to make a largescale scandal out of a very minor issue. This is sensationalism as its worst. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny Obama was treated with black privilege and Carson who is intelligent is being treated like a white lacking these privileges <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not since the reign of Caligula has a political figure had to publicly refute claims that he DIDNT stab a friend or attack his mother. Carson is fucking nuts, and thats just plain ol COMMON SENSE. Surely you poor souls still desperately defending him who buy into overly simplistic views of common sense could already start to see that. Pyramid Grain Silos, for crying out loud! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This interview is so annoying. I wanted to hear something constructive. I dont understand why Carson even talks to these people. I think that she will qualify for the group of stupid Americans. These people are obviously really annoyed that Carson calls them out for what they are, and are trying to get at him however they can. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, Carson was amazing. CNN is pathetic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson, I am seeing how the media is attacking you. Dont let their games get to you. the more they attack you, the more I love you! Its going to backfire on them! fight for what is right!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not since the reign of Caligula had somebody in politics had to publicly refute claims that he DIDNT stab a friend or attack his mother. Carson is fucking nuts, and thats just plain ol COMMON SENSE.

Wheres the Carson press conference in Florida at? Damn lying frauds! Frank Marshall Davis ring a bell? Crony News Network. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Like Osambo, Carson supports TPP. That alone shows he cant be trusted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
who is Ben Carson????? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is right. The liberal media let Obama get away with murder. Literally. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson calls them out. Racist haters gonna hate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Regardless of if they offered him a scholarship this man is unfit to be president. He has no clue what he is talking about when it comes to politics, economics, or foreign policy. His tax plan would plunge us farther into debt. His draconian view of social issues is borderline fascist. And he is an antiscience fruitcake that denies things like evolution. In short, this man is a joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It happened 50 years ago, why are you digging so hard to find something to hit Carson with <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
goddamn i dont agree with Ben Carson on everything but this is one brave bastard <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is going to revolutionize the current state of the American News Media! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is right about what he says and the main street media has done full out attack on his personality and background. She is trying her best to upset and discredit him. Also she went on to dig further to discredit him further yet again. She was formerly on on Fox News and can see why she is gone. Ciao Yall <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson makes a claim regarding sealed documents and then refuses to back it up........ has he been briefed by You Tube trolls ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Go Dr. Carson, youre simply the best candidate running for President. President Dr. Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Are we living in some type of alternate reality? Is the media honestly suggesting that Ben Carson lied about receiving a verbal guarantee to attend West Point... 50 years ago... with zero evidence. The media is really showing their true colors. Luckily the general public has 2020 vision. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Given the recent news cycle, I think it is incumbent upon all of us to breath deep, take a step back for better aim, then point and laugh derisively at all these morons that have been defending this lying idiot Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Russia and China take a piss on the US, Putin literally humiliates Obama and you guys still think he Obama is great. You cant even laugh at that, its just sad. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Another bought out garbage bag full of shit . Sanders no super pac 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This guy is a nut case <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This man hit the nail on the head. Media bias is Americas number one enemy. There is a reason the constitution only protects one profession. The profession that is supposed to keep the American public informed of THE TRUTH. You, CNN, have forsaken your duty and are guilty of treason. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What a great rebuttal, Dr. Carson Err, that would just be, err, stoopid. Way to address the merits and nuance of the issues when taking a hardline approach, Doc. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is so lame. This chick cant even wipe her butt probably and she thinks she can nail a lie on a man whos a world renounced neurosurgeon? Carson has more brain cells on one of his finger nail then all of the CNN lamebrains combined. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i do recall them doing this with Obama and in comparison to what Fox news did to cnn doing with Carson, this is nothing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wasnt carson leading in ur new Iowa poll? now ur saying carson is catching up with him and trump has always been ahead? this is all a false lie and there leting trump get some credit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sounds just like the typical bat shit GOP front runner to me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Ben Carson is a true conservative who believes in the power and freedom of the individual, he would not care if an individual chose to have sex with men or women, or chose to define themselves as gay or straight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To Ben Carson.....................YOU LIE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This interviewer was either absurdly obtuse or pretending to be absolutely ignorant for ratings. Cheap. How indecent. Dr Carson dealt with it really well as well as anyone who doesnt want to give the flare up the reporter wanted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
643, Carson voice kinda turn ghetto thats how liberal twisted words then politicians has to come out and clarify but the damage have been done so their political career end <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Who said that for a valuable American to run for President it must be a Politician?!! Ben Carson is a man of moral values, great smart ideas and above all common sense and wants this country to survive!! Carson is an example of what a REAL President should be. not the pathetic ignorant hypocrites we have now in Government! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons a nut case. Just like Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is nuts and a fargin liar. He even lied about West Point <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is trying to portray Ben Carson as a liar, but they give ZERO coverage to the lies that Hillary Clinton and Obama have told on countless occasions.... If they gave equal coverage, Obama would have been impeached long ago and Clinton would be in jail where she belongs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not trying to shill Crippled America, Trumps new book, on here. But in one part of it there is a discussion on what he calls gotcha journalism, where they try to take something the interviewee said and paint them into a corner to get them to say something damaging to their reputation or credibility. This is a PERFECT example of that gotcha journalism. Go Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what a joke... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So these dude has never been around politics and all of a sudden wants to be president??? His opinions and lame life story is making people like him fuck Carson and trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Lunesta Carson may be a smart man but you sure as hell would never know it by listening to him speak. He just babbles and babbles. Without Foxnews we would be Cuba, then he gets mad when she asks if she is referring to Communism. What else would he be alluding to lol? He is so full of crap it is embarrassing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I see nothing wrong here. CNN is just doing their job. Ben Carson just gets super uncomfortable answering certain questions and gets really sensitive about it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Carson was telling the truth why is he an angry black man now? Hes only upset because he got caught lying. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
820 I died laughing, he basically called he stupid <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
tbh I would love to see trump as a president. I feel that he at least got some charisma unlike that stoner carson which can be the best puppet for heck anything. can you believe the amount of anesthetic b.s hell talk in his speeches. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahaha if you think Carson is a real black president? Then something is wrong with you. He essentially thinks like a southern white plantation owner. He opposes everything that will help or is currently helping the majority of the black population. H <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson is spot on as usual. A man of pure integrity. Only those with open minds understand him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not voting for Carson and i happen to think he is a decent guy but dang media trying to drown him hard last few days <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is going dooown. By the time he lose his cool in the interview, I knew it, hes going down. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank goodness Dr Carson can deal with real issues and fly by imagined ones ... media is pretty worthless anymore ... talk about the news for goodness sake ... they dont know how anymore ... they truly do not ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, screw you too Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is no one mentioning this trumpsalarypresident20159 But they are stuck on did he or didnt he with Carson? Trying to persued people that Hillary is the best candidate oh pleaseeee AS IF <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Way to go CNN!!! YES!!! This is what I was talking about!! Now your foolishness is so blatant, so obvious, so clear, that only the most dimwitted would be taken in by it!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! I cant want for the upcoming tsunami of support for Carson!!! You may be responsible for the good doctor getting into the White House! You are a Carson supporters best friend. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson It would be interesting if he wanted to expose himself... but I will not be the source of their victimizing ReporterOkay so you dont believe we will be able to find any of these people who witnessed or were involved in the attacks CNNs reporters are literally sociopaths unable to comprehend that some people dont want to be on worldwide news. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im so sick of Republicans crying anytime someone asks them a question. They are such babies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is ABSOLUTELY Right on this <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jesus christ, it baffles me that a first world country can take a person like Ben Carson seriously. The US never ceased to shock and deceive me. No, the U.S is not the greatest country in the world, it is possibly one of the worst first world countries of our time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a simpleton and a WEAK bitch. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What a load of bullshit CNN. Wed just like to talk to these people who were victims 50 years ago.. So you can hold an inquisition and convince half of America that these people are lying to protect Ben Carsons story? This is the first time Ive seen the media try to argue that a presidential candidate is too nice to have attempted to stab someone. My god <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It really does baffle me that a moron such as this Ben Carson could possibly be taken seriously. God the US never ceases to shock me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WTF is wrong with all these comments? Ben Carson is avoiding EVERY single question.. you cant even ask him if hes having a good day, because his answer will be about why you are asking him that question and not Hillary Clinton! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great Job, Alisyn!! Carson can not withstand scrutiny by honest journalists. Terrific reporting by CNN reporters Maeve Reston and Scott Glover. Very impressive! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a idiot Carson is, I didnt say that er yes you did, so the media is supposed to be neutral but fox tells the other side? Surely they should tell both sides fucking idiot <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is pretty extreme. He wants an already moderate press to become much more conservative. Sad. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is smarter then all TV journalists combined. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I can understand Carsons frustration but he needs to realize that the US media is controlled by Jews and this bitch gets her orders to smear and put words in peoples mouths like Carson and Trump. This is why Hillary NEVER gets grilled by any news station because the elite are protecting her and paving her way for next president so she will protect their interests. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Another attempt by liberal media to lynch a conservative black man. Well were not going to let it happen this time. We the people are going to be the underground railroad for this man. Any attempt you make to smear him will backfire and fail soundly. Its a shame really... liberals falling back to their roots. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a fake and no Republican in their right mind will vote for him .... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Benghazi! I want you to go back ask HIllary Clinton about Benghazi. I believe Secretary Cliinton answered 11 hours of questions, from Reublicans, about Benghazi.

CNN had been reporting on Ben Carson and his alleged violent youth. are you kidding me.

Carson 2016 Make America Smart Again <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson apparently doesnt udnerstand the nature of basic facts or how evidence works in the real world, which isnt really all that surprising given that hes a thoroughly delusional religious nutjob. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016 Make America Smart Again <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only tactics being employed here are by Carson whos showing his egomania, pathological lying, shitty personality. He sounds like a politician. The guy has no track record in a position relevant to the presidency and he gets mad when people look into all thats actually there. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I HATE CNN. THIS JOURNALIST SUCKS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lol Repblicans dont have any policy ideas they oppose whatever Democrats propose and find holes in them. No idea is perfect and it is very easy to find holes but it is very hard to find a solution. Ben Carson dont have any policy about education and thats why he ignored the question. Thats why when Republicans get elected, they never do whatever they promised to do because they dont concrete solutions they just get elected for opposing the Democrats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson has absolutely no idea how to answer a question. Hes clearly alluding to liberals in his statements, as well as the US being communist Cuba without FOX News. And then he cannot handle clarification questions. He is right about one thing though, I do know exactly what hes talking about. And I think hes full of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN interviewed people who may or may not know Carson whom implied that he may or may not have been somewhat violent as a child where these strangers may or may not be lying for the camera...and yet....CNN ran the story that Carson is a liar? Wow, journalism at its worst, corrupt and dishonest. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obvious set up by CNN. They went in with the attempt to make him look bad and generate anticarson soundbites. This what they prepped before the interview. CNN WE DONT TRUST YOU! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really cant stand these socalled journalists .... its no wonder, CNN, why people think less of you than they do of Congress. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson was smoking the Fox News crack pipe <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doesnt it seem strange to anyone else that we already know more about Ben Carsons childhood than we do Obamas? What passes for journalism these days is a complete joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Another crazy bought out politician . And your a fucking lunatic if you think Fox News is news . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN you are disgusting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trumpCarson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dishonest disingenuous questions for Dr. Carson, free pass questions for democrats. Simply atrocious journalism. This is more tabloid style reporting than serious real solid journalism. CNN is an embarrassment to the profession! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doc Carson spews verbal lobotomy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Allison used to work for Fox. Thank God she left. I stopped watching Fox when I saw they were trying to sway the election.Watch OAN News. They are Fair and Balanced.Carson is a Fox News puppet. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson, sorry somebody was speaking to me. Meaning her producer was feeding her words because shes just a puppet for the leftwing CNN Clinton loving network. What an idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow he thinks we are stupid.Your done Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The problem with Carson is that he is used to taking things on faith. So when he says he did all those violent things we are supposed to believe. Thats why he cant wrap his head around CNN looking for evidence to support his claims at 334. Evidence.. for what? Just believe <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
645 see how she tried to twist the mans words.... Then people talk about Fox News ... smh <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im so tired of gotcha journalism. CNN gave Obama a pass. They never scrutinized his record. They worshipped him. But not a Republican like Carson. They make me sick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Dr. Carson..Keep up the truth <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He shouldve never bragged about stabbing people. Creepy.Thank goodness Im voting for Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Every one that doesnt understand what Ben Carson is saying might be because their understanding is based on an emotional desire for Republicans to fail as oppose to a sober and refreshing desire to make this country Great Again. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ive never heard Carson hit someone so hard before... sheand CNN deserved it, though... just be glad he uses words now instead of hunting knives and baseball bats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How are you going to find them? Exactly. You wont, because theyre NOT REAL. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol shoutout to all the racist republicans out there,lord knows it hasnt been easy for yall..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson poll numbers is going down the drain after this <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is so full of shit and didnt answer the education question......... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is this woman really so stupid as to think Carsons obvious joke about media bias meant that he thought America was a communist country ten years ago? How does she have the gall to ask such a stupid question? She should be laughed out of her profession if that is really the case. But really she knew what Carson was saying, but when he called her out on it she had to double down on her faux ignorance to avoid revealing her true intentions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No wonder this guy doesnt campaign much. He sux. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nominating Ben Carson would mean the end of the Republican Southern Strategy. If given the choice between the first woman president and the second black president, the Ted Nugent segment of the party wont vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She looks so embarrassed! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
MIC DROP!!!!! Way to school her Dr Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Get her Ben!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson. Answer a fucking question. You just sound creepy, and retarded. You are running for President of the United States. Is this how your press conferences would go in the white house? What a joke. Did this guy not understand what running for President entails? You said you were a violent youth. Nobody can find anyone who remembers you as that kid, and you call the question out of line? This guy is a joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is it me or Carson just make you fall asleep when he talks..... He sounds like he is drunk.....and he seems like he is struggling big time to talk <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is a joke. Answer a single simple question. Dude is so full of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
can CNN take a look at Hillarys crimes instead of trying to ruin Dr Carson for some tomfoolery. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson was the one who chose to use them to be part of his own story initially , and now blame the media trying to verify her story ? If he cares about them so much why brought it up in the first place?!?!?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, ppl like Ben Carson are their own worst enemy. So glad he wont be our next president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson sounds like the other Rep. candidates. A flat out nothing. What sets him apart? Hes black. Come on you stupid people WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL ABOUT CARSON? Hes black and he has a built in constituency with racist black people who would be for carson no matter what he says and degenerate, sick, doormat white people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a stabber. Hes been stabbing the truth about evolution for years. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Always so defensive.. Why not just clarify the confusion if youre telling the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dude acts like President Obama didnt get vetted, and then doesnt answer any questions. So full of shit. Dont believe him at all. Dude. Everybody that remembers you as far back as elementary school remembers a quiet dork, not an angry person. You say all of this is well documented? bullshit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The guy is a complete idiot. Just from the first minute ill never be a politician yet is running for president. No one is talking about the fiscal gap despite a lot of people talking about this <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is so vague, and full of shit. Dude never really answers anything with substance. Its like watching someone play dodgeball. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It sounds to me that she was threating him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cnn should be ashamed of itself for doing this crap reporting. Dr. Carson is well vetted go ahead and ask the thousands of patients he saved. Shame on you for this witch hunt. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this Carson dude is way way out of this world #endofrepublican <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
my god, this bitch is rediculous. she takes words spoken in jest and presents them as sincere. i mean seriously i guess if carson had joked that 22hubcap she would present it as sincere and not as jest <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People like Ben Carson are their own worst enemy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is so full of BS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont believe this fucking guy. The story is well documented, but you cant find it? Guy is so full of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahah I like Carson smartest most perspicacious candidate on both sides <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does wolf give a shit about race and religion? You dont think there more important problems in the world? This is such a dumb interview. The world is full of haters... Keep doing your thang Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow very bad by CNN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Do I think Ben Carson is a pathological liar? Yes I do. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Typical CNN Communist News Network smear machine at work... The American People dont believe anything this biased network spews. I am not a Carson supporter however the hunt for dirt and controversy is typical of this News networks propaganda machine. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Pathological anger . . . OK and a robbery occurred while Carson, a vegetarian, was at Popeyes was never reported to the police. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson was gay in the past...thats why he doesnt want ppl looking in his past <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank you Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson will not represent black people well at all or give proper speeches and opinions or actions when something bad happens to black peoples in America. Hes a black republican and doesnt even realize all of his friends in the Republican Party are racist. Cant trust him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is full of crap. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ccn is digging so hard.. Dr Ben Carson is man God <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Picking on Dr. Carson? Well, Im a Christian and I think hes on point about that. smh <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a great, great actor <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN its becoming obvious why your against Ben Carson. You cant accept a Black man is running for president , dont try to deny your thinly veiled racist comments against Carson. If you do , it only proves your a racist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
love the way Carson handled this <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He tried to stab a very close relative???? LooneyTunes!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats really unfair to Ben Carson to bring up something that happened when he was 14. I dont think he deserved that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Weird how Carson says he doesnt want to make running for president funny but his radio ad is a rap song <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sorry, Ben Carson seems like a decent man, but he doesnt have the self control to be president. He said when he reaches a boiling point he loses all rational control. He cant have his finger on the nuke button. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Ben Carsons head is used for storing grain. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is his religious beliefs that tempt me to vote for him. Its refreshing to hear a presidential candidate firmly believe in Jesus Christ as their lord and Shepard. More power to him. It makes media freaks like CNN look shamefully ignorant of American culture. But thats why no one watches anymore. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lmao seriously? Grain stores? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People that lie tend to blink a lot when their eyes are open and also tend to close their for longer periods while telling stories. Basically they are picturing their lie to make sure the picture makes sense. Then the rapid eye movement is an attempt to get the picture straight with the words! Carson is pathological on both accounts!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HA! HA! CNN has no leads! Carson1 Media0 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If only CNN would have vetted Obama and the Clintons with the same eagerness. What a bunch of total nonsense. Focus on the issues CNN and stop the smear campaign. Ben Carson is a good and truthful man. Unlike CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Question Where were these journalists when Hillary professed she,.dodged sniper fire never happened? So what, Carson was an angry teenager. Maybe it has something to do with those vaccines he got as a child... which he alleges has no studies to connect autism to. there are btw. js <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson NO LONGER a viable option for presidential candidacy 2016! He is a 100% segregationisthypocrite against the transgender community 100% discrimination against the transgender community Rand Paul Elizabeth Warren 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I feel like Carson is an extremely focused guy but he lacks certain social skills that often result in him making random shit up in order to be accepted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if your running for president, the media has an obligation to look under every nook and cranny in regards to their past, good job CNN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN witchhunt. disgraceful journalism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THANK YOU BEN CARSON! I love this man! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If being gay is a choice, when did you choose to be straight Dr Carson? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO PROTECT BEN CARSON BY KEEPING THIS VIDEO BELOW FROM YOU! <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its so obvious that Carson is the antiChrist mentioned in the Bible. Cant you all see that? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These ignorant white Communists are so Prejudiced its Ridiculous, They are so Threatened when a Black Man has a Freemind, This country is changing they need to get over it ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
First Ben with the street thug comments and now Ted the super hero. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is correct. Read The Rights of Colonists I. paragraph 6 by Samual Adams <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is so stupid he thinks Jesuss Father Joseph built the pyramids to store grain in. First of all there is only one small room in the giant pyramid. Why on earth would he say something so stupid. He also says some scientists say aliens might have built them. Well there is not one real scientist on earth that says that. There are UFO enthusiasts that have said that but not scientists. If I needed brain surgery I would rather have Herman Cain do it on me that Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i love puppies, but i feel like CNN could probably find a better news story <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have never seen a genius like Carson in my life so talented in speech <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All the little Universe in Dr Carson are the brains, more ill brains and his 2Holly Bible He want solve the Economy and the complex international relations only praying, praying,more praying and recitin old pages in the Genisis and rest of Old testament. His brain is sick and he is a idiot boy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What kind of made up thing is this? I dont know which is worse, Ben Carson and his make beLIEve stories or CNN for not only reporting on them but for actually beLIEing them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Really CNN the Isis is on the attack, the US debt is now 18 trillion, Christians are being beheaded in the Middle East. You release a story about Ben Carson when he was a young teenager. This is pathetic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Carson is bat shit crazy however, anytime white people arent automatically assuming or believing a black man is violent is a win in my book. Keep on stabBen! Im sure though, had this been Obama in 07, media would have been all over this hourly. RightWing SuperPACs would have spent millions on attack ads. So would the Clinton camp, actually. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Many of us have done things we arent proud of. Fortunately dr. Carson found God and has become a better person since. For those who dont have the Lord in your life, you dont know the kind of power He has to convert u. Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant stop laughing! The media is a bunch of fools! They are protected by the government to protect the people but instead they continue trying at every angle to catch Carson in a lie and they will never do it. They just dont get it. You will never win with Carson because God is behind him. So funny! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
keep digging what crappy reporting u think specific info on getting in trouble as a kid is relevant and must be proven what a joke i cant even remember my friends names i got in trouble with at ages 7 14 How would there be some record of it? Seriously CNN is tanking Dr Carson is no liar unsubscribe <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN SUCKS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nowhere in the Biblical scriptures, does it say, what Carson mentioned. Besides, a follower of Christ does not believe in the Bible, he believes in Jesus, who could be found in the Bible, and Jesus said seek for the truth and the truth shall let you free so if pyramids were build to bury pharaohs, then let the truth be known. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol Marco and Cruz?? Trump and Carson. Clueless CNN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so u mean the mummies inside the pyramid are actually an Egyptian person who accidentally got trapped while storing grains.? Wow no wonder he is a brain surgeon he is smart! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson will be the first black president if he gets in. Obama is not considered black in most countries because he is in fact 50 percent white. He is mixed race not black. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Evolution was invented by the adversary.another gem from Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The smartestdumbest man alive. Ben Carson, tell us about Jonah and the whale one more time. Haha, this guy sure does have a sense of humor for a low energy neurosurgeon. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does it matter who built the tombs! He is running for president of the United States not president of the Smithsonian <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What the difference between what we currently have in office and what we might have in office. No one can verify what BS the current president says about his birth or other topics, so why should Carson have to. Big O set the standards, the other guys is just walking into the open doorway... It doesnt matter what a person skin color, just if they work for the people, to help the people and dont forget they are a person too... not a GOD. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Okay Ben Carson go ahead...choose to be gay right now. Did it work? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He sounds high as hell. Republicans are his drunk friends listening to all his bs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
More like a crazy pastor then a president. I think thats what conservatives want, a Christian theocrat <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lol, what a fruitcake... He is such an antiscience person. This is unacceptable for someone applying to be the most powerful person in the world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think these candidates and media are just testing the american people to see just how much shit they can feed them.. and if no one really cares and says nothing, then they will be able to move further to the extremes of the crazy right and be able to say anything they want. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its pretty bad that a republican is so bat shit crazy that he makes Donald Trump look good. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is CNN concerned about Carsons street cred, or whats the deal? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
people look for the ben carson interview from march 3rd believe was uploaded its about how he says notzi german is u.s.a., trump knows what hes talking about........ Trump 20162017 . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a lying piece of crap. He can take his stupid religion and shove it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a liar. He also sold his dignity by saying that supplements helped to cure his cancer. He will say anything for a buck! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just think. If Ben Carson gets elected President and then somehow gets shot in the head hell be able to perform his own brain surgery. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON IS A SCHIZOPHRENIC CORPORATE WHORE WHO CLAIMS GOD SPEAKS TO HIM AND THAT HE TRIED TO STAB PEOPLE. HE IS ALSO OBVIOUSLY A DRUG ADDICT. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a fucking crazy and a sneaky sinster beast....something about this man is very dark, why dont the evangelist ray on light sheep people see this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson makes Jeb Bush look like the energizer bunny <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is psychopath <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone here a perfect human being? Raise your hand... seriously, this whole election business is getting stupid. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Never mind the biased media...Carson is going up in the polls! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so, bill and hillary can have a dead body moved, but Dr Carson cant practice a little unscheduled surgery on his buddy? oh the madness! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is just another authoritarian Progressive incrementalsocialist RINO infiltrating the GOP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson lies again? Not surprised. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
World leaders will not respect Ben Carson. They didnt respect Obama. Because of this, Obama throws tantrums and tries to destroy everything descent around him. Ben will get mad, lose it, and try to hit someone on the head with a hammer. What will it take to push Ben Carsons special button? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny this guy getting stick for something he did as a child like we havent all been stupid kids. But George Bush got a pad on the back for domestic violence, drink driving, drug abuse smh You really see Americas double standards shine bright sometimes lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON IS A PUPPET ASS ROCKEFELLER FLUNKY WHO ENDORSES TORTURE WHILE POSING AS A CHRISTIAN TYPICAL POLITICIAN HE CAN K.M.B.A.KISS MY BLACK ASSHOLE HE IS NOT DIFFERENT THAN WAR CRIMINAL BARACK INSANE OBAMA FUCK THAT NIGGER!!! CYBERFRUME104NMRK <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN promoting Carson while trying to tarnish trump. Great impartial reporting guys. WE SEE what youre doing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like how Carson just remains calm and doesnt take the bait. He answers each question without getting upset and I love all his answers. #hesaG <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is full of shit, in it for a book deal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I knew that Ben Carsons poll numbers would invite attacks from the opposition. I would have thought CNN would have tried to at least disguise their guile. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the media 20 years ago NEVER ever showed which side they were on!! This is so sickening. Carson deals very well with this guy and he doesnt know what to do!! HA HA <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It was stated he did this shortly BEFORE entering high school. Naturally, those in high school may not have known who he was before the change? Disgusting left wing media... Im independent voter btw I like carson, rand paul, and bernie. Though, I dont agree with a lot of bernies idea, I can still respect the man <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Vote Carson!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is proving to be the genuine article. Keep up the research! May I suggest similar vigor with other top tier candidates? Even Democrats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is the genuine article he conquered his anger as seen here. CNN is to be commended for their work in researching his background. They are further encouraged to research all Candidates backgrounds as thoroughly as they can, as good journalists should. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey CNN, they live in Detroit! You cant find them because theyre dead. Most black men dont make it past 32! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the best everyone else is mess. Although i like Trump too. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Oliver Stone had a point in W when he painted George as a dimwitted tool for complete psychopaths to use and abuse. Ironically, we now know Chaney and Rumsfeld is dumber than anyone. Cause they really should have known, with all their resources, that some parts of the world are not ready for democracy and dont give two shits about freedom. The world we have today is the fruit of their watch. What a monumental failure these people are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Liar and fraud. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a republican I really feel Chiney betrayed the American people. I cant wait for a trump Carson bid though <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No police report of a robbery in a fast food chicken joint where Carson the vegetarian was getting a meal and no one heard or knew of these attacks and no police report, no witnesses ... and we will not provide any information about who knows .... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I didnt believe the polls said Ben Carson was the the top running. I trust Trump is the top runner <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So hes a psychopath? Lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is is it so hard to believe the knife story? I find it harder to believe that Hillary did not know that a terror attack was a terror attack. Can CNN put the same effort exposing Hillary Clintons lies about her emails and the Benghazi terrorist attack? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont want any of these psychos to win presidency. Fuck all of them and their policies. And for what its worth, even if Ben Carson IS leading the polls, you guys DO know the media makes those poll numbers all up? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont know why but i want ben carson to come up behind me as i touch myself and whisper into my ear in a deep voice hmmmmm im going to make your boy bussy purr massage my shoulders than fuck me right in the asshole <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love atching carson shut don these childish dramabaiting antics, fuckin get this anchor off the air hes trash. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson is clearly lying, and right wingers who claim to be christian still pick up for him...hypocrite much? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
no truth here at any media outlet thats mainstream. Carson is a war mongering pussy. no politician is going to make things better in the US. Just us. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its bizarre the CNN cares about the truth about something, but I guess this is good. But, it would be even more bizarre if Carson had made up this story. If it is true, then I dont want him to be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He lied about being held up at a Popeyes organization and probably lied about this. The first neurosurgeon without a brain! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How does Dr. Ben Carson handle stupid questions from Blitzer? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And he is the leading in the GOP polls. What a sociopath. He lied about getting held up a Popeyes organization and may have lied about this. The first neurosurgeon without a brain. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Seriously what is this crap? Obama pals were domestic terrorist Bill Ayers and Rashid Kahlidi, Palestinian terrorist. but were going back to Carson high school fights? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Ben Carson, a prince among men, reasonable and sensible. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson will provoke war with Russia. Trump said that he would allow Russia to handle ISIS in Syria. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The moment that Ben Carson entered the political scene was the 2013 Nation Prayer Breakfast On February 7. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wish Ben Carson wins president elections <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets talk about Carson wanting to get rid of social security and Medicare!? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump had like 31% to 18% against Carson today. CNN is stretching. Trumps gonna win the nomination then the presidency. They can cherry pick polls that are skewed in favor of Carson by, for example, only polling 400 people but were not fooled. We havent seen a candidate this popular since Reagan but better in every way. Go Trump!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald trump is a pure and utter jackass. The guy has not got a clue. He attracts big crowds because he is a clown. Looking at this from Ireland, and he is giving us great laughs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson really interviews well. As good as if he had the questions beforehand. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is the candidate that the liberals fear the most....Rand will beat Hillary hands down! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is a last ditch attempt for the media to TRY and knock Trump off. The TRUTH is, Carson doesnt lead in on single poll. The media is a complete joke. Where are all the people voting for Carson?? Are they all going to the Trump rallies by mistake? LOL Nice try! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trumps a joke no way his policy can work.... Does he even understand how the government works? How laws are made and reformed? Is he really that stupid? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

President Ben Carson I cant wait to see him in that position , its going to happen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You are controlling deviant, immoral, and aberrant sexual behaviour by legislating against homosexuality. Has nothing to do with racism which stereotypes people based on color or nationality. Another propaganda farce of the homosexual lobby, this entire racism argument, just like the term homophobia. What about pedophobia? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is an idiot, just because he is a doctor people think he is smart, what the hell does being a doctor have to do with politics and foreign affairs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is on top of the polls but is still an enigma .. More like we cannot find any dirt on him. What an enigma <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Someone equated Ben Carson to the Taliban and ISIS. What utter drivel. Only a moron would make such a stupid comment. ISIS abducts women and forces them into sexual slavery, beheads their enemies, and destroys ancient monuments. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson as the rest of them are nothing more than puppets of their Zionist masters. You all who participate in this charade are nothing more than branded cattle. My guy, no my guy, your guy sucks, no your guy sucks. I have a message for all of you. You all suck. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i do not seeing mr carson running anything out side an operating room,sooner or later he is going to have to buy in if he is going to win,he will not raise a billion dollars without selling out to the big boys,TRUMP can cut that check right now.

Every right minded person knows that Carson and his niceness will be swallowed up by Washington day one..We already have a guy in the white house with zero experience in the business world and look where we are now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is a liberal tool for CNN. Always trying to discredit Donald Trump and never criticizes the other candidates. There is nothing Donald Trump has stated that isnt true about the other candidates. The corrupt media is on the attack and the people need to wake up to their lies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and Carson thats what we need Americanmade strong, away with Obama and the administration completely <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No they arent. Trump is ahead. Stop pimping Carson. There is no competition. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like how they were careful to select black people to make racial commentary. If this doesnt support Carsons statement, I dont know what would. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stop using trump as your headline to push a narrative for Carson. It annoys me you think just cuz you went to college we dont see what youre doing. Getting a journalism degree doesnt all of a sudden make your bullshit invincible. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ford was a moron.... in the great republican tradition like Reagan, Dan Quayle, Sarah Palin, George W Bush, Huckabee, Michelle Bachmann, Scott Wallace, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz, etc. etc. shit there are too many to name <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
His support is dying <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ben, his intelligence and character, his bio and education, his devotion for the country and a lot of his policies, his run for the presidency 2nd choice but its his campaign and his staff that I dont like. Some among them are corrupt and do things in the worst possible fashion and Carson doesnt seem to take full control over it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson especially because he knows islam is a threat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

fuck Ben Carson. shit fuck Donald Trump too <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is not fooling everybody. We know that if Carson was the winner and nominee you will begin to eat him alive just so your Killary Clinton would win. YOURE USING LIES just to hurt Trump, cause you know and we know that TRUMP WOULD KICK KILLARYS ASS in the elections. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not sure how much Ben really supports the 2nd amendment. During another interview he said that people in cities shouldnt be allowed to have semiauto firearms. If he only supports civil rights for people living outside cities, Im not sure if I can vote for him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben CARSON IS ONE LOUSY cunt.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Carson becomes president, would it be Mr. President or Dr. President? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is going to be very entertaining, now Ben Carson is leading the polls jajaja, all is between Trump and Carson, Oh my LOL. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I can confirm that no republican will ever be elected president again. They cant keep up with social trends and new generation. Its all over for them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I support Carson because he is the only candidate from either party whose heart is bigger than his ego. Rare for an MD America has probably degenerated beyond the point where we deserve a leader like Carson, but we desperately need hm. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People call Carson an idiot, yet he is among the worlds top neurosurgeons at John Hopkins. People call Trump an idiot, yet he turned 1M into 10B. If these accomplishments are idiodic. I would hate to see the standard for being a genius in your liberal dictionary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a Cunt <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson should drop out. We dont need another Obama in the white house. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow. Trump calls Carson whos also a fucking idiot weak on immigration while Trump has actually YET to come up with an immigration policy, because building a wall doesnt count and wont do jackshit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

LoL Carson acts like hes still in the 60s <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
evidence that could support sexual orientation is a choice are bisexuals. They like both women and men. I believe its because theyre hesitant between being gay or straight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

FAKE POLL. MSM LYING, NEVER PUT UP POLL #s WITH TRUMP LEADING! Carson is trash, the guy is a little slow and seems high all the time. He has no specific policies and doesnt take any tough stances on really important issues, hes a weakling who cares only about african Americans.

Ben Carson is backed by CNN which is backed by China to destroy America <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Because of Dr. Ben Carson, there is a spiritual awakening taking place in America. Hes not even president yet, and he has already significantly changed the level of consciousness among those he has reached with his message. A positive and hopeful message. CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is too weak and lacks enthusiasm. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

NBC poll of 400 people. 5 points. ... Mmm, I dont know. Another poll at the same time has Trump ahead by 1. Same thing, national republican primary poll. Carson and Trump do seem close. Hard to trust NBC after their behavior at the debate. Waiting for more polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Up to this point it was really hard to tell who I was going to vote for. I did my research and Ben Carson has my vote. This country needs a wise president like him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THIS IS A OLDER POLL, THE NEW POLL SHOWS TRUMP UP. CARSON HATES EVANGELICAS AND PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS SAYS THEY PRAY ON SUNDAY SO JESUS WILL DISTROY THEM BEFORE 2020 THIS IS HIS 7TH DAY ADVENTIST TEACHINGS TOO <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Super pacs try to destroy Trump. It will be very hard but if they succeed, you know who will be next ? Carson and that will be much easier. When theyre done with him, they put their establishment candidate like Rubio. So lets do everything possible not to let it happen. Keep the good work ladies and gentlemen!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wolf Blitzer, stop trying to force Carson to lie and say a factually biracial president is just black to make you feel whatevs. Murdoch, who I couldnt care less about, was accurate Carson, who I also couldnt care less about, would factually be the first black US president. Americans, especially those in broadcasting, need to relearn the art of embracing facts rather than advancing racist fiction and I say that as an American. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Its all going according to plan. Trump and Carson will exit. Jeb will save us from Rubio. Who the hell is Rand Paul? Jeb has us right where he wants us. The only thing missing is Dan Rather. He is missing, I hope. I dont watch TV, so I dont know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Republican field seems to be working together surprisingly well. Lets see if we can fit every one of them into a government position.

725 I think youve answered that question. Yet he kept pushing about the Real black president and the religion thing. Why? Because Carson originally said he wouldnt raise the debt ceiling, then when Wolf played the hypothetical if you were president NOW game, and Carson said he WOULD raise the debt ceiling, Wolf thought he caught him in a flipflop sound byte so he quit pressing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats the most enthusiastic Ive ever seen Carson. Still sounds like he got shot with a tranquilizer dart. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Thanks for clearing things up John.. Youre still no conservative!!! After hearing what you said about CNBC pretty much made it clear to me youre a RINO. For those that are still on the fence with this guy, this might make things a little more clearer for you.. Heres what he told Fox News..

Carson is one creepy dude <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson creeps me out <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bringing racial ethnicity into the presidential campaign is profoundly racist. Noone should care whatsoever about the colour of Carsons skin all that matters is the mans character and his political beliefs. The entire Carson is blacker than Obama nonsense is nothing more than a cynical and manipulative Republican PR stunt, with the aim of winning over voters disappointed by Obamas alleged failure to achieve racial equality and end police brutality during his presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a little to weird for me...IMO <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
El Chapo Rubio will open up the borders even more than Obama. Listen to his speeches from a year ago. He is only talking tough now because he is lying to his base to get the nomination. TrumpCarson 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN need to support Trump instead of hating on him like that old hag Kelly from FOX news. Enough of your hating Anti Trump and Carson supporter trolls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hi Im from the UK and have no stake in american politics and absolutely no love for evangelicals or republicans but Ben Carson surprised me here with a coherent argument that makes sense. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

No, Dr. Carson, I didnt read your book I was too busy getting briefed by my owners at CNN, then taking my sweeeetassed 6 or 7 figure salary to a Ferrari dealership, Lord Taylor and eventually a 400dollar hair cut. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I could be wrong but Ben Carson has all the making of a psychopath overly religious, extremely well mannered, and what they say about all psychos he was a good neighbor. hahaha but like i said i could be wrong <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a second Obama... America is delusional. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Breath of fresh air.Lets go Ben.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson because he is not politically correct. I like that he understands the danger of islam. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Well he found Osama bin Laden and you DIDNT, and I live in a black community where most of them cant stand Ben Carson. They say things about him I cant even put in print bc it would look totally wrong. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why did he apologize? He doesnt owe any stupid libs an apology. Homosexuality and NAMBLA are closely tied together in the sense that theyre both sexually immoral and promoting all kinds of unnecessary drama and crime. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolf Blitzer sure made a fool of himself in his inquisition of Ben Carson. CNN is this really what you want trying to force feed somebody to agree with your philosophy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is nothing more than a small, bigoted Uncle Tom House Nigger! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Big government? Do they even know what a small government is? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wolf Blitzer is trying every other way to trip up Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
oh boo hoo. You are being interviewed for the most demanding job in the country if not the world. Heck you interview for a job at WalMart they ask you questions you dont like. Heck you would be lucky if you get an interview where they ask you one question you like. Go cry to someone else. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The candidates planned on attacking the moderators. It worked for Trump attacking Fox. Now it works for Carson....received 2 mill since the debate. Suckers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You dont have to be a republican to love Carsons wit! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson better <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I say again we need the dynamic duo Trump and Carson enough said! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Actually Dr Carson has supported gay rights and fair hiring practices in his boardroom meetings with Kellog and other companies. He just believes that marriage is a religious function between a man and a woman. I think he would be perfectly okay will civil unions and equal government benefits for gay and straight couples. Which I happen to think most Christians support. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The way he answers the medias attack questions reminds me of Ron Paul. I like that he doesnt pander down to those assholes. I would support a PaulCarson ticket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
colbert is a scumbag. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a huckster acting like some great and humble man of God when he has a net worth of 30 million dollars, twice as much as even Hillary Clinton. Hes got a new book he wants to sell you on the campaign trail so he can add to his already obscene wealth instead of giving it to charity. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Reading the comments below, I have hope for America. America is starting to understand that this man can cure America. Go Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
....A Candidate for US President who says ... Being gay is absolutely a choice...., ....absolutely deserves to be at the White House !!!!.....WOW ! Scientific Researchers on Biochemistry, Genetics, Medical Research, Sexology, Molecular Biology, Psychology, Psychiatry, and Psychoanalysis...seems to be delighted with Mr. Carson words...., and seems that they will definitely vote for that wise..., intelligent..., and rational Candidate !!!!!!!!! ....... Good luck Mr. Carson ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson may need a few pointers on some areas, but other than that, Ill consider him for my vote if I decide to vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Check this out carsonteapartydarlingbutishe.html <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson has stopped the incessant blinking, but still looks like he is taking a small nap between questions. He waves his hands also incessantly and should stop that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Looks like Ben Carson is using Takkia. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does Carson have to be asked 8 thousand times to explain his comments!?! They could be controversial, yes, but they shouldnt be because they are wellthought, educated, and true statements! The only reason theya re controversial is because people are shocked at how brutally honest Carson is! Brilliant! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson has some strange policies Regulating college professors for Liberal Bias Over turning Row v Wade Regulating debate moderators Bible Tax policy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When Ben Carson is to scared to answer these simple opinion questions how the hell is he going to run a country? Im sure he knows how big of a fool he will look like if he did answer the questions honestly. A doctor that thinks sea shells are on top of mt. Everest because of the great flood in the bible, and he has the nerve to complains about a Muslim being president. I think anyone can be president as long as they are not stupid. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Here we go with the media bull shit. Ever white person i talked to says the same thing and its not carson. Just there way to make us think that this is what the rest of the country wants when in fact its not. Civil War is coming if this bullshit happen again like it did with Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lol CNN is trying real hard here. They just told us the same thing Ben Carson said last night. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Some of you are real dumbasses! Is that the best you can come up with? So what if he did endorse it, what harm does that do to the country? MSM is just doing their best to find something to give him hell about. They have to support their Democrat supporters and lobbyist. Where are the videos where they keep the Democrats honest? Hillary Clinton? If this is all they can come up with for Dr. Carson, he doesnt have much to worry about! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does Ben Carson even know what a contradiction is? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whats so controversial? Obamas actions speak louder than words. Trump 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow that might be the only thing I like about Obama. Fuck Israel, they are fucken terrorist. They need to give back their land they stole from the Palestinians! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I honestly would prefer Trump over Carson cause Carson is just a mean man. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a slimeball. How could he lend his name to that nonsense. It is almost as bad as Huckabee using his mailing list to advertise vitamins to cure cancer. These slimballs should be ashamed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
SIR, You Endorsed them.. Carson I Liked YOU, We not need more ,, liars .God Bless <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
dont elect carson. only because I dont want to listen to that god awful lisp of his for 4 years <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If this story were about Obama instead of Carson, all the Carson backers would be speaking a different tune with respect to this issue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would be seriously shocked if Carson becomes President. The Illuminati wouldnt allow someone like Carson be President unless of course he is part of the club himself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
...A Candidate for US President, who says ... Being gay is absolutely a choice... ...deserves absolutely to be at the White House...! Scientific Researchers in Biochemistry, Genetics, Molecular Biology, Sexology, Medical Research, Psychology, Psychiatry, and Psychoanalysis will be delighted with him, and will definitely vote for such a wise, intelligent, and rational Candidate !!! Good luck Mr. Carson !!. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Forgot one important thing... hes a 7th day adventist look up the most important message of his sect theyre a doomsday cult that REALLY want to apocalypse to happen. Giving the keys to the worlds largest stockpile of nuclear weapons to a man who prays daily that Jesus comes back to cleanse the earth in fire isnt just a conflict of interest its fucking crazy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We all know CNN is supporting Clinton blindly ,, we support trump , go go trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the most suitable rep to run for the republicans. Go Carson, you wont win the election, but Ill valiant effort. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Conservatives are angry at CNBC when really their anger should directed at the Republican party. The GOP made themselves look like the buffoons they are CNBC cant take credit for that. This is simply what happens when you put a bunch of obnoxious clowns up on stage. Admittedly CNBC didnt do a great job, but its corporate media, what do you expect? The debate was a total freak show and all of the candidates were bizarre and incoherent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a fucking bad ass! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so you shouldnt ask the candidates a question about their policy proposals? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God forbid these clowns should have to explain themselves. ... look at trump... just stay quiet and you wont look like an idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson , isnt afraid to said what it is in his mind or trying to please everyone including his own race, With all do respect, I see more support to sports stars , entertainers and so on , that one brilliant doctor that is trying to do something good for his country.

Carson is the scariest presidential candidate in recent times.

I like Ben Carson thus far. I see much promise with the man. He seems to be a person of high integrity. THAT EXACTLY what this country needs!!! I like a lot about Trump as well, but I really like Dr. Carson too! This should be interesting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Harvard and Berkeleys science departement says that being gay is genetic based on extended and thorough studies Conservatives Nah Nah not true you liar liberal Ben Carson makes an assumption based on stereotypes Conservatives YAAAS YAAAS SO SMART TAT TRUE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you only follow what the media reports about Dr.Carson then you wont like him at all. But if you get to listen to him unedited then you will discover that he is quite brilliant and very much likeable. He does have some strange views no doubt but who doesnt.

I know enough Christian dogma to say Trump is not a Christian <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson and I like Trump about 5050 on them to be honest. I dont think the polls are honest though because the day before he was on top CNN had videos saying something along the lines of media is accepting Trump could win it all. Either way we got a debate in almost a week I hope CNN didnt just do this to split up the thought to be future PVP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good for you Carson! I dont know how the hell can you be leading in anything, but yet again, its the republicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i dont like carson hes stupid, we already have a stupid president do we need another one <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the only candidate from either party whose heart is bigger than his ego The good people in America know it and will vote for him. All the other candidates just want to win at any cost. America may have degenerated beyond the point of electing someone like Carson, but we desperately need him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben Carson is channeling Forrest Gump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a puppet <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is spot on with so many issues. But not on Putin. We have no business in Ukraine, and it is counterproductive to make an enemy of Russia. Nato will be a disaster in 40 years because Europe will be in the throes of collapse andor civil war, so why throw away so much political capital in pushing it further in eastern europe. We have far more common interests with Russia than e.g. with Saudi Arabia or even China. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Jewish media staunch Democrats, Jews own that Party wants a lame duck candidate like Ben Carson to run against Hilary.... to guarantee her a Jew the sure win. Look how the antiChristian Jewish media just loves the Christian SeventhDay Adventist Dr. Ben Carson... posting false poll results too. Then if he gets the nomination their dream Republican nominee, his Christianity will be sold as antiwoman, as if Hilarytherich cares a fuck about women. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If Carson gets in office and off his meds America will be the next Ferguson Carson will be the gun wielding maniac and the military will be the weapon. Let us not forget what all of these school shootings and killers throughout history have taught us. He was always so quite and soft spoken I never thought he would do such a terrible thing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons a creepy guy, like cereal killer creepy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol he started coughing when Ben Carson was mentioned. Hes like WHAT ANOTHER BLACK GUY?? lmao. #FEELTHEBERN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How low can this go with racial issue? Please do not vote president based on race and color of the person, vote based on his qualifications. I think Dr. Carson is far beyond his color he is the most needed person for America. He will be the one for this world toward better life for all. Support one who can handle differcult situations domestically and internationally. Its time to judge people not based on their skin colors, but who they are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey Donald, let me help you out. Even though Carson knows as much about government as you, hes not an immature goofball. I mean, so what if you dont know about SecondDay Adventists. If that the tired old low energy complaint is all youve got, you better find your way back to the Apprentice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson tried to hit my mother in the head with a hammer, nearly killed his best friend. He tried to murder another child in his by stabbing him in the abdomen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON SAID THAT HE TRIED TO STAB SOMEONE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WHAT? BEN CARSON STABBED SOMEONE? THE CREEPY BLACK RETARDICAN? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The ONLY reason the Republicans want Carson up there is because they want the AfricanAmerican vote to win the White House. Carson is their Obama. However there is no comparison. Carson is an imbecile with a medical degree. Obama is an intellectual giant with a Harvard Degree. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a joke. He has not one ounce of charisma and how he got through medical school is a mystery to me. He is also an extremist. You forgot when he compared homosexuality to bestiality or that it was the next step? Bestiality is sex with animals. If Carson became President this country would be the laughing stock of the world. As if it isnt already. He is no Barack Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and Carson , definitely the favorite choices <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON TRIED TO STAB SOMEONE? JUST LOOK AT THE COMMENTS! I HOPE THAT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE GET CANCER. DIE YOU GROTESQUE FOOLS. TRASH. FILTH. AMERICA. FUCK YOU. DIE. PLEASE HITLER COME BACK. CRUSH THEIR SKULLS. DIE DIIIIIEEEE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr Carson made the case the press is dishonest but Wolf was quick to say lets not talk about the press. The lies from the press are hurting our country more than anything else, with brainwashing students in our public schools a close second. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

7th DAY ADVENTISTS BELIVE PROTESTANTS CATHOLICS WILL ALL BURN IN HELL!!!

I think the media is looking for mud. Carson was not patronizing the victims. I am not sure what carson would do in that situation but I would rather be stuck in the room with the killer and carson than the killer and Obama! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dumb and dumber. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump needs to win the Republican Party, these stupid Iowans need to vote for trump, Carson is dumbass who knows little to nothing about politics he has no future plans like trump has <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What is so great about a policy to not tax the half of the country who pay nothing or little in taxes anyway? Is anyone really buying into Trumps vague policies??? All he says is what is wrong, and never definitively explains what he is going to do about it or how he is going to do that. How in the world does he plan to round up 12 million illegal aliens and deport them???? Empty promises........ CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a dangerous fascist. Google about spying on college students. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson isnt going do nothing. trump will get exposed when the race really heats up. Dont be surprised if Jeb gets the nominee against Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Now, that was a real positive interview. Wolf did try to get Dr. Carson to stumble, but he did a great job of not taking the bait. And he really does know more than people give him credit for regarding International affairs. He is a breath of fresh air so greatly needed in these times. Thank you Dr. Carson for your calm, stable, thoughtful process of how the government should be taking care of business. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes going to do well in places that have high populations of batshit crazy people. He stands no chance of winning a general election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fucking Christian cunts. Fuck IOWA!! If Carson wins there then Ill vote the Jew Sanders so he can ruin them first! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HA! He tried to box in Ben Carson and get him to say something somewhat controversial so they could take it out of context and blow it out of proportion to make him look bad, but he handles these sneaky interviewers so very well. Well done, Ben. You have my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Its interesting to read the dirtiness of the remarks of Trumps supporters when they attack Carson but its so sweet to see how respectful the comments of Carsons supporters are when they reprove Trumps incompetency. Hmmm...very interesting indeed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson prolly got thug life tatted on his chest. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

ben carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In my opinion, Dr Carson is an American symbol. He was born into the bottom of the economic spectrum by his single Mother who had little to no education, but insisted her son climb up and out of their current situation and he did. Bens beliefs may not correspond with a strong number of Americans, but dont deny He has the insight, experience, and the right Brain to get America out of its current economical state into a more prosperous economy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson, we know you are Bush in a black mans costume. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

look at this fugly cunt pushing Carson even though she would never vote for the man because he would want to stop her from carpet munching her underage girlfriends !

Carson is pro forced mandatory vaccinations, anti marijuana legalization, wants to abolish Medicare, and hes backed by big pharma. Hes not the outsider the media portrays. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am not a Republican however Ben Carson has my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You say soft spoken... I hear whimpering. He doesnt command authority or respect and frankly, his beady eyes are too close together. I dont care if he was a bully who resorted to weapons as a child, even if it is true hes still a bitch. Just a bitch with sticks, rocks, and a knife. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Honestly, if the Republican party actually chooses Trump over Carson, then they deserve the consequences that will come from that. Loud and blustering should not trump calm and intelligent <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is right in questioning Carsons weird religious beliefs. People have the right to know that when electing a President. Is the Seventh Day Adventists a cultish group wmany weird beliefs? Check it out for yourself... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am sure he is a good man, but he could never become President in the current world we live in. Considering what the other Republican choices are, he does stand out. After all, the others are just bad circus clowns, that we laugh at, but then shudder at the thought of any of them becoming President including Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wow huge respect for Dr. Carson for being able to put up with that interviewer. The whole time it looks like hes trying to start an argument.

Carsons faith is only a real strength for him because most people are clueless about what a batshit crazy religious sect he subscribes to and the fact hes completely bonkers. Of course, the danger with actually talking openly and in any detail about ones beliefs is that it readily becomes apparent that theyre all somewhat insane and without any logical foundation whatsoever. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Exactly. These people going into gun free zones that are supposed gun crazies arent all that crazy in the first place. They generally arent so crazy as to go into a gun range during business hours.

Trump needs to stop saying Iraq is not a sovereign nation and we can just take their oil. Thats the establishment position, so we may as well have another Bush or Clinton. Actually, if Trump were not the establishment favorite, the media wouldnt be running the fake narrative that they are afraid of him. Think about it. Of course Carson and Sanders are also vetted by Wall Street, so its not as if we have a choice here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is sounding more like a proillegal Democrat. Brain surgeon and a couple small business does not equate to what America needs right now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love the way dr carson answered the same question twice. vote for ben carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
go dr carson! way to go! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When Jeb eventually suspends his campaign he will directly or indirectly refer to the bellicose negativity of the Trump campaign. To which I would reply, then why is Ben Carson destroying Jeb? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Such a shit stirer. I wish gay liberals would put a muslim that observes sharia law in the white house and see if they dont get slaughtered in their masses. Stupid! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson you are an amazing candidate and everything that America needs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All you delusionals on this post that think Carson is anything besides a crazy religious zealot are why the world never solves anything and were swimming in ignorance. What a world!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What the fuck Iowa. Ben Carson is nice but he is weak on immigration. He has supported amnesty before that is the truth look it up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson, God bless him, a great man, but his presidency would mean a suicide, a coup de Grace for Lady Liberty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need a strong leader that will be respected by all. Otherwise we will be back to square one like the current leader we now have in the Whitehouse. When Iowans realize Ben Carson is very low energy to deal important issues facing our country and deal with world leaders, they will return Carson and vote for TRUMP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is proof the people in Iowa cant think, Carson doesnt come close to doing what Trump can do. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DEAR LORD CNN this is like the 5th video in the last 38 hours you guys have posting saying carson beats trump each time with a different title lol....desperate much <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does Carson always talk as if hes about to go to sleep? lmao <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BULLSHIT! FAKE BLOOMBERG POLL! The Power Elite again with Lies, Lies, and more Lies! Trump is far ahead of Carson. Its all propaganda because they know Trump loves polls so they figure if they LIE with made up Fake polls Trump will decide to give up if he thinks he is losing! ITS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROPAGANDA AND IS TOTAL BULLSHIT! TRUMP 2016! HE IS WAY AHEAD OF CARSON! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i like ol ben carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its All About TRUST....TRUMPS The REAL DEAL...Carson would make a great V.P....THE VOTING POLLS ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT COUNT..Not CNNs And Bloombeg <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These Iowans have issues in the brain, thats why theyre voting for a brain surgeon. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson is a Great Man for what he has done, I would have all the respect for him AS VICE PRESIDENT. These days we need Fierce. For The Good Of All Americans <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All this proves is that people in Iowa are SEVERELY retarded. Trump speaks at a 4th grade reading level and Carson is a biblethumping creationist extremist. You guys already chose Mitt Romney... and he thinks he gets his own planet when he dies. Why are Republicans so frighteningly retarded? Why is this even news? This is a year long pissing match between two crazy people who arent going to be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN PLAN CARSON X HILLARYHILLARY 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is scary. Trump is a clown, but everyone knows it. Carson is a bigger clown, but hardly anyone is able to see it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson will never be the nominee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is pro forced mandatory vaccinations, anti marijuana legalization. Hes not an outsider. Big pharma lines his pockets. Do we really believe evangelicals want to be held down and forcibly injected! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A neurosurgeon that doesnt believe in evolution and who stated that homosexuality is a choice? For fck sake only in America! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Republicans will be guaranteeing the democrats a win in the general if Carson is nominated. Id vote for Trump but I couldnt see myself voting for somebody that thinks the earth is 6,000 years old, thats just slightly better than believing in a flat earth. And thats just one of many reasons I think Carson is batshit crazy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont know if Trump is a Christian, but Carson is a follower of Christ. We need a man of God in office.. JESUS 2016 JESUS NOW <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
people understand what hes saying??? he doesnt even say anything. republicans love the fact that he black...hell get the black vote without having to talk. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a twat <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will stop liberal talk on college campuses.....yes, Carson is crazy and a tyrant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
yes Dr Carson......way to go.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
obviously people following Carson are on drugs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why is somebody like Ben Carson is even consider to be President of the Untied States ,this man has the motivation of a Sloth, and would have bigger puppet strings behind his back than President Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
racist idiots <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a MORON...Apparently even Brain Surgeons can be shitheads...WOW! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Forced mandatory vaccinations are not logical Dr. Carson but youre for them. How much are the drug companies contributing for you to take this unpopular position? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i never voted republican... but if hillary is the dem. nominee. ... carson or trump has my vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson voters are basically Trump supporters anyway. Carson has no realistic way of winning the nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont know if like for Ben Carson or dislike for CNN... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson cant beat Hillary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will sit out if Carson is our nominee <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson but I just cant see him winning and being a strong leader. He should be in the administration though. There is no way in h@## he can beat Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would like to see a Carson Rubio or Trump Rubio ticket. I think hes a little too young for president but I also think hes incredibly smart and well versed in todays politics and could bring balance and stability to either of these frontrunners. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Trump attacks Carson then he Trump will surely go down. Trump wavers between policies and views like a leaf in the air. Hes not serious and will never become president. He sounds so fake lol Come on guys cant you discern that? Nevertheless I enjoy being entertained by his folly and his maverick way of campaigning haha <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is 100% right. look at the history. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
now i can see why he lost to obama last election... he just dont have it... i regret i was supporting him... thanks God now we have Trump!!! TrumpCarson for 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons just trying to sell some books. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This republican poll had Carson on top based on percentages, and yet the last slide, Clinton is on top when sanders should be...fuck right off <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016, Carson has no chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Like both Carson and Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump?Carson? Are Americans this stupid? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr.Carson is a good man I would vote for him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
nobody cares about carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Carson gets nominated they will be asking for his birth certificate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media always has to keep something going ever day about race in some shape or form. Its so damn annoying!......I thought Ben Carson handled his self well like always! Wolfe was clearly trying to push the subject to stir some things up...... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No good. Carson doesnt have the goods to get elected in the general. No way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does Carson talk like hes been beaten in the head,,,,, like Mohamed Ali? not good for the nation <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Half the time Carson speaks he has his eyes closed. We cant have a president like that. He wont win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
all good. you dont nominate trump, then ill vote democrat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has the power to bring black and white together. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BLACK MAN ON TOP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its only a matter of time before da trump goes balls to the wall and just says blacks dont belong in the White House or some racist bigotry that will bump him over Carson as the rednecks will salivate over it. What a joke the Republican Party has become. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is. it my imagination, or is the interviewer is being a purposeful JackAss? If I was, in Dr. Carson place, Id get up and bitch slap him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Funny how they say this, yet Ben Carson is beating him in Iowa by 8 points.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is for AMNESTY and if president would go to war with Russia he said so himself look it up! So keep on voting for Carson so you can learn the MEXICAN NATIONAL ANTHEM soon! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im black and I cant stand COONS that kiss Clintons ass... Bernie is the TRUE president for America... Not this cunt! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson just doesnt flex man, dudes dope <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would love a TrumpCarson ticket.. but whats more important is that Jeb, Fiorina, Rubix Cube get the hell out of the race ASAP. The rest are of no consequence and will not threaten the success of these two. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Tapper what about Ben Carson? Romney starts coughing LOL <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn... Hes so retarded, I was hoping he would at least run so wed have months of funny material!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is on fire!!! #TRUMP2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson like most politicians is speaking to the people of the south and everybody who disagrees with gaymarage, its all for show and votes,nothing else ,saying what he really things could be a different matter which would cost him votes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the closest to an intelligent nonpolitician candidate. Biden looks and acts like Jerry Ford, of which Johnson said, He cant walk and chew gum at the same time. Bernie is just an old fool. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What are Trumps qualifications to be the POTUS? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Republicans, you cant be serious. Donald Trump?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

So obvious that trump will become president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yay! At least it wont be Donald Trump if Hillary get the nomination <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a nutcase.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I WILL NOT BE SILENT...I BELIEVE...yeah..., I believe the party...and THEY want HILLARY....so Average Joes gonna take one for the team...so Trump Carson can have their chance to make America GREAT again....the Democrap has to stop...Joe spoke the truth! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This bias reporter represents all these comments that bash Carson all because of ignorance.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Too bad all the candidates dont get grilled like this. The whole Obama black thing was stupid. Hes only half black anyway... why not grill Dr. Carson on Obamas white half? SMDH... irrelevant shit. Much of the rest of the interview was relevant. Im impressed with Dr. Carsons responses. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great answers Dr. Ben Carson, thanks. Funny, I did not hear Wolfe apologize for twisting Bens words. I would also like to say flat out that Obama is NOT a Christian. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im more and more impressed by Carson the more I see of him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love how stupid CNN is. Putting absurd words in Dr. Carsons mouth and twisting what he says to use against him. Its quite amusing to watch. Dr. Carson does a fantastic job of sticking to his guns and defending himself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolf is starting to show more respect for Dr Carson ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
thats all liberals can do, shout nonsense! finally a candidate that deals with these idiots accordingly <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson has the dead, dull body language of someone who is not right in the head. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope he does pick Carson for a running mate hes going to lose half or more of his supporters that under any conditions are going to have another you know what in the White House. We need a woman in the Casa Blanca ASAP as of now its just been one big small fucking cock fest. I like pussy in my house. HRC16 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like a CarsonTrump ticket <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson But Trump is the man for this election. The Economy and ILLEGAL ImmigrationNot Immigration, fools are the problems that need to be addressed and I feel Trump is more qualified. But TrumpCarson ticket would be great! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow. F you CNN... trying so hard to take down Carson Trump as well. CNN....You do realize how weak, pathetic, and afraid this makes you look? Not to mention exposing how goddam controlled you are <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a real gentleman. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP WILL WIN CUZ WE NEED TO MAKE AMERICA WHITE AGAIN. BUT XANAX CARSON DOESNT REALLY LOOK GOOD ALONGSIDE TRUMP. I THINK TRUMP WILL END UP CHOOSING A MUCH BETTER RUNNING MATE THAN XANAX CARSON. THERE ARE MORE GOOD PEOPLE OUTTHERE. BESIDES, ITS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT CARSON COULD START FALLING IN THE POLLS. ANYWAY, ITS TO EARLY TO DECIDE. GO TRUMP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump will win in a landslide. Its a disgrace how we treat the Vets. illegal immigrants invading the country. Companys moving out of the country. TrumpCarson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson THE BEST CANDIDATE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HEY CNN...WHY ALL THE LIKES ON THIS ARTICLE, HMMM?...TRUMP AND CARSON TOGETHER HUGELY POPULAR FOR SPEAKING THE TRUTH...CNN AND HILLARY TOGETHER KNOWN AS TRUTH DISTORTING UNTRUTHFUL...NOT SO POPULAR...HEY CNN...HOWS THAT WORKIN FOR YA? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TrumpCarson ticket Landslide victory no matter who the challenger is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You have a birther and someone who thinks the big bang theory is the work of the devil. But oddly Carson doesnt mind talking about scientific evidence when it comes to the supposed link between between vaccines and autism. I guess ill have to start working on that bunker. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT!! WE NEED A GUY LIKE THIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I hope that America wakes up and see the true genius of Mr Carson! Ben Carson will make a tremendous President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Democrats wont be able to win against the TrumpCarson ticket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
By all means. Let the narcissist oligarch and the creationist lunatic run together. Carson is black Sarah Palin and Trump is a failed businessman who has been accused of rape, declared bankruptcy 4 times and doesnt know how hair works. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like both Trump and Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so, Trumps numbers go down, Carsons numbers go up, and they think Carson should be Trumps running mate? why would Carson even consider that, when he is about to pass Trump for the first place spot? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i could have sworn you liberals told me the GOP was racist! crow anyone? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if hillary is the nominee... i would rather trump or carson win <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

what is wrong with wolf blitzer. is he a real black president. is he a real black president. trying to bait carson into answering a stupid question <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They said that obama was smart but Carson truly is <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuckin Wolf Blitzer! What a prick! Hes bought and paid for isnt he folks? Keep reading your cue cards Wolf. Ben Carson is the most intelligent man to run for office in quite some time. If he cant solve problems in a, matter of fact, common sense way, then no one can. Together with his wife, a mixing pot of morals, ethics, the Christian way, and a very powerful sense that they will do whats best for the country. I believe hes the best choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson was never calling liberals racist for supporting gay marriage, he was calling them racist for attacking him with racist remarks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2k16 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like your style Mr. Carson. You have class, youre intelligent and reasonable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Carson is brilliant! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson made Blitzer look like a child simply groveling for a sound bite to make Carson look bad in some way. He failed miserably. Blitzer should feel like a complete hypocritical idiot after being exposed for a small minded political hack. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For such a brilliant man, whos a scientist by the way, to believe such stupid unscientific things is proof that religion warps the mind... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this guy choked against Obama...he let all republicams down.. his word means nothing!! its clear that he doesnt like outsiders specially Trump and Carson... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Blitzer goes after Carson like a prosecuting attorney and then tries to twist what he said. Good for Carson, he sticks with his beliefs and isnt fooled. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You guys should make a twitter poll so you can see that Bernie is more popular. F your bullshit polls, what did you guys poll everyone in the office? You guys will see how social media will influence this and future elections. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Being a bigot is a choice, look at Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson does not understand the constitutional amendments. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everybody knows Obama is not black, but biracial. Just like Halle Berry and Lenny Kravitz. So biologically, they are not black, if black means both parents are black. But, culturally, a biracial person can be considered black in some occasions. But I know a lot of biracial people that feel more white. Ben Carson has two black parents, so actually he would be the first. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons logic on every other issue has been so sound, its hard to sit and watch him say being gay is a choice. Really makes me question if he is truly all about the Constitution as he claims, or if his religious beliefs would end up the deciding factor in his legislation as President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson doesnt dance to the tune of the MSM, which is why they keep asking him these same questions over and over. And just like someone who is way more intelligent than the MSM is, he keeps schooling them. They are simply to sycophantic to the Left and too damned stupid to know it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Funny how this same guy couldnt even let Mr Carson finish making a single statement without interrupting during the interview after the Muslim comment. So ridiculous! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
223 jealous Hillary supporters disliked this video. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Liberals call this man dumb, stupid, and ignorant. How is a Pediatric Neurologist who received an MD from Yale stupid or ignorant? How is the first man to ever successfully separate conjoined twins dumb? Look in the mirror democrats. Quit with the doublestandards. The talk on how conservatives are SO racist, yet many of you obviously discriminate against Dr. Carson due to his race. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson was compelling until his dangerous imperialistic antiRussian tirade. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is not a politicians. Either way he doesnt have the capability of getting Black People out of this condition. We dont need anybody to address the needs we need someone to DO SOMETHING. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is as black as my mixed race children. Rupert was right. If elected, Dr. Carson would be the first black president. Both of Dr. Carsons parents are black, this is not the case with Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow this guy was really reaching to make a story out of nothing. This is supposed to be Carsons chance to shine on CNN and this guy asks him these dumb ass questions.. Are you series? CNN Fox News are the dumbest, ignorant irrelevant news medias Ive ever seen. Carson is trying to promote his presidency this guy is asking him about black presidents Muslims lol Hes only making republicans look even worse <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
America may have degenerated to the point where we dont deserve Ben Carson as our leader, but we desperately need him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lol when he said that dumb nigga Ben Carson he choked cause it was so funny <#urls:0> <+emoji:2> <-emoji:0>
What about Ben Carson? Cough cough. Haha!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
110 I just love Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank you Mr. Carson for making this idiot, look like exactly what he is... an idiot. I know that was not your purpose, but he doesnt understand your purpose. He thinks that he is smarter than you.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson went beastmode <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Up against super pacs, billionaires? Hillary You HAVE a superpac. Your top contributors are BANKS. Billionaire Donald freaking Trump donated 100, 000 to the Clinton Foundation. Billionaire Haim Saban donated to your super pac for you to fight against palestinians wtf hillary? spouting bullshit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im mostly liberal and have no love for Carson. But Wolf Blitzer and CNN are a FREAKING JOKE. Carson is giving completely reasonable answers and you are badgering and baiting him with BS. This is why everyone hates CNN on both sides. Fox News and MSNBC may have agendas. But you guys at CNN are purely incompetent rubes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So many stupid questions come on! I expected better from CNN. Carson is not President material but again come on! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is she suddenly Burnette Sanders? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fake southern drawl appealing to the low information voters. Benghazi witch belongs in prison. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson can become the first black Republican for president, but he wont be greater than Obama. Democrats ftw! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump should invite Ben Carson to be his running mate Vice President. It would make losing impossible, because not only will it capture the most votes, but the Trump Is A Nazi nonsense from the commietards Democrats will come off even MORE ridiculous <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank heavens Crazy Carson will NEEEEEEEEEEEVER be POTUS!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson wins. Wolf owned like Hillary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a smart man and I think he would be very good for this country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is to soft to be a president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is terrible and Ben Carson is absolutely brilliant. Id vote for him in a second because it is so obvious he believes what he says, is honest and is the exact opposite of a politician. The difference between his story and Obamas is he actually had a job and created something and knows what being an American is all about. Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The problem with the Republican Party is they look more and more like ISIS every day. I wish Republicans werent so scummy and despicable. Too bad they cant leave America, since they hate freedom. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great job by Ben Carson, CNN ultra liberal talking head tries so hard to corner Ben Carson. Pundit has unconditional support for Islam and refuses to understand the dangers of sharia and the violence of Muslims in the middle east. They arent just extremists, these the basic tenants of Islam. But liberals must always support Islam, and bash Christians. That is their code. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What the fuck are you trying to do here, CNN? Are you going to try and make Dr. Carson say something so you can twist his words? Like seriously, why the hell does Ben Carsons or any other candidates color matter? If I didnt have to watch your channel to watch debates, I would never watch it. Your channel and network fucking sucks. Screw you guys for manipulating the American people and using your power to stir up controversy. Fucking cunts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson got my respect with this one. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bizarre... he is a bizarre man... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wait a sec. Did Carson said he would go after Osama bin Laden? Doesnt he know bin Laden is already dead? He has shit for brains when it comes to current events. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why the f#K are people offended by every single thing someone says. It seems like half the English language is becoming a trigger to someone. Political Correctness is killing this country. I am not voting for Ben Carson, but damn this guy is a nice dude, if people find everything he says offensive I would like to have a camera follow them around. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Could Wolf suck Obamas balls anymore, Really! he did and extra ordinary thing? he made a phone call apology. My god how did he find the courage, the strength, the testicular fortitude to pick up the phone and make a call. I hope the secret service was there to protect him during that call. He may have broken a nail pressing the buttons. Im glad Carson didnt fall for the black President BS. Id like to Bitch slap Wolf just once. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is very wise. He doesnt get cornered well, and is pretty solid in whatever he says. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER INTERVIEWS. WOLF DID WHAT HE HAS TO DO, AND PRETTY WELL. HE DUG A BIT HERE AND THERE, AS HE SHOULD HAVE. AND BEN CARSON NEVER FLINCHED AND SHOWED THAT HE IS ONE HELL OF A STUDENT. HE WAS UP TO ALL OF THE QUESTIONS, AND THEN SOME. VERY PRESIDENTIAL. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an idiot thinking he can be Black and Republican <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Imagine such nonsense Black Ben Carson is running in a Republican Party, that is made of white supremacist idiots who can not tolerate anything other than whites. The only thing that Ben Carson have in common with white Republican is his stupidity and the bullshit that come out of his mouth. And the only reason he is allowed to run in Republican Party is that it make bunch of racist white assholes look less racist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
By the way, Wolf is a waste of an interview. He should be blowing Carson under the desk. While Brianna does the interview with Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have to say, I love Mr. Carsons ideas about cutting Government budgets. I see so much waste in the office I work. End of the year have to buy crap for the office. I personally think it needs to be twenty percent, not three or four percent. But, then CNN would be pushing Trump, not Carson. Oh snap, they are pushing Trump! Damn Ben you stepped on to many toes with your ideas <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Murdoch not too much about anything just like Ben Carson. Carson should stay in is field, because is mediocre at anything else. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carsons go to when he doesnt know the answer That doesnt matter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has so much integrity, the reporter is pretty slimy, the media keeps trying to bait Mr. Carson for their own agenda, but cant seem to pull it off with him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolfe is a total Democratic shill. He keeps trying to trap Carson and other GOP interviewees into a controversial statement that he can later exploit, Then later they will ignore all the intelligent answers and play the 10 second sound bite over and over to create a false impression. Carson says i was not in favor of sending troops, and Wolfe says so you say it was a major blunder? He is a disgrace as an interviewer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON CARSON CARSON CARSON <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson IS THE MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The interviewer tried in vain to get the doc to say something controversial so that CNN could then deliberately take it out of context and use it against Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i would not vote for a religious fanatic like carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is Dr. Carson black? I thought he was a brain surgeon. I didnt think the color of peoples skin was important. Whats important is..........Oh yeah....The content of ones character. Sounds to me like liberal progressives democrats are a bunch of racists obsessed with skin color. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Remember CNN is pro Hillary, so they want to prop up the Republican candidate they feel would be demolished by her. Which of course is Trump. In actuality, CarsonRubioCruz are probably much closer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its a damn shame that this is what we get for news. The interviewer wanted so bad to make Carson look bad, but it was he who sounded antagonistic, and ignorant. You people are why the rest of the world looks at us like idiots. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont like Ben Carsons ideology, but he is 64. Dude looks 46. Thats awesome. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
how come cnn doesnt attack democrats like they do with Republicans. every question was an attack on carson. yet with hilary, on the missing emails that would have resulted in impeachment or loss of job if it were a Republican are considered annoyances. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why are they trying to entrap him. Carson is not dumb he know what you idiots are doing trying to get him to say Obama is a real black president. All that crap is pointless and Dr Carson isnt entertaining that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson knows that theres one wittle wee wee, every mouse has a wee wee. Thats a very important thing to know <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
possible challenge How is Carson a possible challenge when Trump has twice the amount of voters than him. Media, you just dont get it, YOU CANT STUMP THE TRUMP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Blitzer is another one of the ignorant media POS looking for the soundbite that does not represent the context of Dr. Carsons statements. Blitzer and his comrades make me want to puke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand and Carson are my favorites <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has his finger way off the pulse of the American people, probably because its right up his ass. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is so on point that the only way they can try to discredit him is by gotcha questions. And THAT isnt even working!! Lol!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Ben Carson on almost everything, except for the fact, he is way too wishy washy. He stated, he would be willing to talk about anything that is reasonable. Hes too willing to compromise, in My humble opinion. And he seems to change his words around to try and justify silly statements. I dont believe there is anything that can be done about the senseless killings, besides arming, and training the unarmed, in gun free zones. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson is full of shit. he defended Kim Davis for placing her religious beliefs first when she discriminated against the constitutional rights of gays and lesbians.. this man is a fucking joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is the medias fault. Spewing lies about Trump to get some riled up. We dont support this act. Knock it off! And Carson wont last long with that high of a poll. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolf Blitzer is the dumbest motherfucker. These are such stupid questions, and hes really scraping the bottom of the barrel whenever he tries to attack Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fuck Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson for President! Im a registered Dem but I really like this guy and feel hes the most trustworthy candidate. So full of common sense and always know how to outwit these liberal journalists and their BS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, blaming Obama for the black divide? How about over 400 years of subjugation in society? That has nothing to do with it? Perhaps someone like Obama needs a bit more than 8 years to reverse of the severe effects of something like that. Smh. And spreading such lies about a religion over a billion of the world believe in? Carson should be ashamed of himself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a great man, just like Donald Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whats shocking about it?? Obama is biracial Carson is black Rupert is correct <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Great answers Ben Carson, exactly the way Christ would answer, humble and not talking against anyone good job, keep up yhe great campaign for REVIVE....... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im sorry but I cant support a man who says we shouldnt have a Muslim president because their religion might prevent them from performing their duties, then turns around and supports Kim Davis, a Christian whose religion prevented her from doing her job. Ben Carson is a hypocrite. And the Trump supporter is a dipshit. Obama is an American, and hes actually Christian. I fucking hate people sometimes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
cnn hates carson..I wonder why? maybe theyre racist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

cARSON will get in this is all to dismantle white ppl from taking power,,,that black guy crawls up israels ass too so whoever does that has a string chance trump likes israel too,,but hes going to realise why he gets so much bad press is because of the same ppl he supports are really not supporting him because they want american nationalism gone squashed,,, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
a trump and carson ticket would be like the ying and the yang...the harmonious balance of energy would be mesmerizing. together..they may dominate the entire world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and Carson in 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I down voted this clip, but let me be clear, the down vote was for CNNs dishonest, useless questions, and a HUGE up vote for the great Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
30 seconds in ...much to do about nothing... Thats not the saying, it comes from the title of one of Shakespeares works Much Ado About Nothing... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Did Carson say, I think its much to do about nothing? 030 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a fool, and not presidential at all. Hes just selling his book. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why cant wolf ask a real question? dr. carson is right most of the media has their own agenda. and dr carson doesnt need to be on the same page with wolf. who in the hell does wolf think he is? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The fact is that Obama is half white and half black. Raise by white people. Those are the facts. And what does real black mean? I know a lot a black people that would think that Mr. Carson is not a real black man, and he is a product of two black parents. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Ben Carson is absolute proof that just because youre intelligent enough to be a brilliant neurosurgeon, doesnt mean youre intelligent enough to do other things, like be president of the United States. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not scared of faggots so im not homo phobe just throwing that out there. I just think that two men sucking each others cocks and mounting each other and putting there penis into each others butt holes is pretty disgusting and I definitely dont find anyone a hero for admitting they do that. JS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolf Blitzer needs to get his head out of his ass. Is he a real black president? How can Ben Carson answer for Obama? Why doesnt Wolf grow some balls and ask Obama those questions??? What a coward!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson came across as very intelligent and articulate in this interview <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only idiot Wolf Blitzer would ask these questions. The guy is shameless, but racist. Why is he asking Ben Carson this? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is amazing and I think he is a great fit for our next president and on his point of the gun control and Nazi Germany, I will say it for him...yes if people had guns the holocaust may have not happened and to support this theory I would encourage you to look up the warshaw ghetto uprising that took place during WWII. Do your homework before you judge someone on a topic you know nothing about. If people are willing to fight anything is possible. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Murdoch is just expressing his opinion Expressing his opinion on biracial couples? Blatant racism. Carson would call it racist also if Murdoch was not giving him so much money. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is delusional. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is full of shit! You dont ask a dismissive hypocrite about race. Hes a purveyor of social conservatism as to why he hates liberals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is essentially stating that every single Muslim is an extremist. Such a bigot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is such a moron. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson may have been smart when he was younger, but hear him now, he is a soft spoken dumbass. p <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

At a way Trump! Carson VP, unbeatable!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN tries so hard to bait people. Carson refuses to be baited in almost every interview. It frustrates the stupid interviewer and they keep pressing the issue. Wolf thinks hes smarter than anyone. Hed be very wrong and this interview proves it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sandersbigger government more spending more taxes. No one asks Sanders how he expects to pay for all these freebies and government programs. Meanwhile the US is trillions of dollars in debt. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson did well here <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is too uninformed to become the president of the United States. Additionally, he is a puppet for the religious right as well as the political right. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not sure whether to give this a thumbs up for Carson owning this liberal media pawn, or give it a thumbs down for being an idiotic and sensationalistic interview given by Wolf that was obviously meant to obnoxiously attack Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolf Blitzer Is he a real black president?... Fuck man, Im no fan of Ben Carson, but Wolf here was just being sooo retarded. Really, is that what your going to ask him, is Obama a real black President. CNN really has gone to shit and people like Wolf are the reason why. Garbage journalism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would vote for Ben Carson in a minute. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ok so Im a Sanders supporter lay it on me. But I have a question. Why is it that only Trump and Hillary and the only candidates getting all of the air time. I see very little about Bernie and see very little about Carson. Regardless of the candidates we support. Any Carson fans getting sick of the lack of exposure? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Asshole is trying like hell to bate Dr Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolfe Blitzkrieg took a flying face plant! LOL DR. CARSON is miles above the feeble CNN attempts to bait him into a corner. Go BEN CARSON!!! Would love to see Carson and Trump on the same ticket....either way. TrumpCarson or CarsonTrump. We cant lose. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Sorry Wolfie, Your not trapping this man in your semantics BS, fishing for a sound byte that could be twisted and used to make him look bad.

My Republicans friends and I are all white, and we love Dr. Ben Carson, and cant wait for him to become president. Well, I guess that squashes all the Democratic lies of Republicans being nothing but racists. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have a feeling that Ben Carson has actually been sleep walking for the past few years and one day hell wake up and be like holy shit i dreamed i ran for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not a fan of Ben Carson, and I do not want him to be president, but he handled this interview well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Blacks are the real racist of America They only voted for Obama based off his skin color Listen to this ape, learn proper English, Is that hard to memorize your own native language ? Martin Luther King would be embarrassed of these degenerates, so is Ben Carson if its not obvious <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carsons mild attitude is the perfect means to counter pressitudes aggressiveness <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Black lives matter constantly makes terroristic threats. Arrest the people who were chanting pigs in a blanket fry em like bacon or any of the other chants they made threatening cops. Oh wait, that would be racist to hold them to the same standard. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN, you want to play semantics? Okay, here we go! Obama is the first real halfblack president. If Carson is elected, he will be Americas first, real black president! BTW, Bill Clinton was the first fake black president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson says a Muslim president would have to reject the tenants of Islam. the reporter are u saying a Muslim president would want to establish a theocracy? not all Muslims would want to make Islam the church of the state. thats an unfair assumption no, carson is just saying that a Muslim president would have to abondon certain muslim principles, traditions etc. I mean, imagine our first lady with a vail covering her face... that just wouldnt work <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson openly admits to tax cuts for the rich and not the mass. The founding fathers knew that the mass and middle class should never be income taxed due to it running the risk of slavery. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson should have said that they would both be real black Presidents. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson will never know about being a black president, unless he asks one. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
no fan of Ben Carson but this feels like baiting on Blitzers part. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This CNN guy is such a retard hahahaha so ignorant. How can he be so stupid to not understand what Dr. Carson was saying? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No war on women fucking asshole Nazi liar! Fuck Trump, fuck Carson, and fuck that retard base! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is Papa Doc Duvalier, the Torturer. Beware! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You can do anything to the Kafir? Like really Ben Carson??? Lke really?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
since when is it cool to be a socialist? history proves it does not work. nothing is free, you have to go out and make something of yourself against all odds...that is american. china cuba russia and all the murderous regimes take the guns from the peopel and then kill them...but you get free healthcare free school and no freedom hahaha this dude is a twirp and if you support him your need to go live in a socialist country for a while and see how you like it good luck dick heads <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bernie Sanders cares more about the black community than Ben Carson aka uncle tom ass defender of white supremacy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson should drop out of the race. Putting others before yourself is admirable. If he really wants to impress, he should leave the country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a very intelligent man. When he is elected president history will show that he will be up there with Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Right Bernie. I guess youre only for the truth when it concerns people who arent democrat. You both sit up there telling everyone how Edward Snowden needs to be held accountable, yet somehow Clinton is an exception. Roll out the red carpet. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does Ben Carson not accept evolution as a fact? Is it because he is ignorant of the subject or he has been indoctrinated by creationists who make false and deluded claims, or both. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its not a fake scandal....CNN REPEATEDLY trying to trick Ben Carson into saying something controversial through repeptitive manipulative questioning is them trying to create a fake scandal...What Hillary created did is real unless youre a blind Hillary drone who has already decided to vote for her no matter what she says or does <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Honestly though. Why dont you ask legitimate questions like these at the Republican debate? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wolf Blitzer is a real asshole <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey said he liked Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Jep Bush then he said the most sexist thing ever, oh and I like that lady Her name is Carley Fiorina! I guess we still have a long way to go for anyone to accept a woman president. No respect there and its sad.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good job Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
love how they havent come up with a single new question for Carson... its always the same with them yawn <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Also anyone else like how bernie smiles when he shakes killarys hand and then once he lets go he turns serious. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Bernie but we all know were going to be forced to pick from Either Hillary or Jeb in the end. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

INVALIDATING THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT BY SAYING ALL LIVES MATTER IS THE SAME AS INVALIDATING THE STATEMENT SAVE THE RAINFORESTS BY SAYING SAVE ALL FORESTS BECAUSE NOT ALL FORESTS ARE IN DANGER LIKE RAINFORESTS.

I predict it will eventually be Sanders vs. Carson... Which is nothing for Bernie!!! Feel the Bern 2016!!! Its so sad that Carson and Trump are the only one polling double digits nationally on the GOP side. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow...CNN trying to coax Ben into saying a controversial statement...Literally FABRICATING drama and and trying to steer Ben Carson into controversy trying to trip him up with manipulative questioning. DISGUSTING...just DISGUSTING CNN is a disgrace. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

He managed to sum up perfectly exactly why I would NEVER vote for him. If you dont think ALL lives matter, you should not be the POTUS, plain and simple.

what a stupid left wing circle jerk. Hillarys losing to trump and carson right now lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In no way did Dr Ben Carson blame the victims of the Oregon shooting for getting shot. What he said is if they all bum rushed the dude less people would have been killed and thats a fact. He never blamed them or said anything to that affect. Next thing you know people will try to say he thinks the Jews brought the holocaust on themselves . Stop twisting the mans words and listen to him. Hes very intelligent , and you might learn something. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so what happen to ben carson? he seems a nice person to be a president cos he wants to deal with the education system.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

...America has Ben Carsons back. The news media is trying to show the American people how to bully. The news media is showing America just how lame they are. I have not seen such unaccountability ever before, what has not occurred to them is that Americans are smarter than they know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You should see the comments about Dr. Carson on left wing channels on YouTube. They are just flat out disgusting. Quit being and Uncle Tom, your a traitor to your own race, your just another dumb nigger following white people. People are too obsessed with race and ignore what the individual has to say rather than the skin. Last time I checked skin doesnt talk, a person does. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is Wold Blitzer a real jew? Is that a serious question to ask? who cares. Is he a good interviewer out to make manifest the real abilities of the presidential hopeful? Not by this silly question. I admire Dr Carson for sidestepping crap and talking about real issues. Who cares in Obama is real black? Is America after Obama better off than america before Obama? Are the blacks better off, more prosperous more secure, less dependent? That is the question <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson, so smooth! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Is not like u know 100% for sure whowhat the rebels intentions are? At least we know who Assad is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is one of the most educated people out there today. Keep up the good work Dr. Carson. God bless you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am not a supporter of Ben Carson.....but i can not deny his knowledge on the issues. He has clearly been doing his homework and then some. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a useless uncle tom....and a nutcase.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is he such a vague little bitch. Quit implying things, be a man say how you feel and quit pussy footing around. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson Like a boss. He took Wolfie to school! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I was looking forward to hearing from Carson. Then I saw Blitzer. I dont particularly enjoy watching sophists at their work. Sorry Doc, Ill have to skip this appointment, because Blitzer makes me sick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT CARSON VIEWS IS OF THE RFID CHIP INPLANT . AND WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT IT BEING INPLANT IN HUMANS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This may sound harsh, but Black people trust Republicans like a Mother trusts a child molester. Lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fuck ben carson fucking xenophobe <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you take either the Bible or the Quran literally then your unfit to be President. Next time Carson wants to crap on someone elses religion while ignoring all the crap thats in his own religion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson Pendejo loco. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson like so MANY other millions of Americans are so misinformed about Islam. As the interview went into the 3min mark I noticed several inaccuracies about Kafirs, rights of women and homosexuality. I come to say this if politicians are not fully informed on ANY particular matter they shouldnt speak with so much confidence on it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obamas biracial Carson is black <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hes the President and hes black. In other words stop asking dumb questions LOL. I love Ben Carson dont get into the childish games the media plays. Keep it real. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy doing the interview was stuck on STUPID!!!!! Dr Carson told him 100 times that if any religion didnt mesh with American values he wouldnt advocate for them. Yet this guy continuously says so you think Muslims cant be patriotic? Dr Carson is unflappable . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
god let USA have a president like Mr Carson ruling amen ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is going of the title of biggest Uncle Tom alive. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As the parent of a child who was a brain surgery patient of Dr. Carson and who has talked with Dr. Carson, Wolfs blatant attempts to get Dr. Carson to take the bait is sickening. Yes, Dr. Carson is black. No he is not a professional political aka hes an outsider. However his intelligence and principles are what matter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for President!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson makes me want to vote.... For him..... I never vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Try as you may, Wolf Blitzer, you were unable to rattle andor trap Dr. Carson. Dr . Carson OWNED Wolf. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why cant you just say hes a christian? why is this guy trying to incite some kind of personal thing against Carson? terribly unprofessional interview in general. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ohhhhh shit Carson crushed that dude <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a horrible start. Bait bait bait, and Carson passed on all of it. He refused to allow his words to be twisted, and he refused to take the bait. Very nice work, but really why would all that drama crap be at the beginning of the interview? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a piece of shit, oh yeah he knows many muslims who reject shariah..hahhahahahaaah sure buddy <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson said to a man that threatened him with a gun Hey, you want this guy over there! pointing to the man behind the counter. What an embarassing coward he is. Such a person must never become this nations president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a big stupid LOSER! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is all talk. Thats OK though. The more Trump talks the higher in the polls Dr. Ben Carson surges. Love it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When these guys try to trip up Dr. Carson its so obvious who the brain surgeon in the room is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is what you called getting schooled by a DR! The question was why ant you say hes a christian Dr, Carson was right on point with his answer, he sd i have to take him at his word beautiful! cuz we dont know if Obama or any christian for that matter is a REAL CHRISTIAN ONLY GOD KNOWS THAT! WELL SD DR! BUYAB CNN!! THOSE PC POLICE DAYS ARE OVER!!!! AND CNN IS TRYING TO HARD NOW! AND EVERYNE KNOWS IT! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson sounds like a pure democrat! BEN CARSON 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is living in cloud cock cock land if he thinks people armed with pistols and shotguns could some how hold of an even limitedly determained state army... They were armed at Waco... What kind of rubbish military is he planning to have... I like the man and his achievements but sometimes he sound like one of those detatched Americans who really know nothing about the world and history beyond their front yard. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Black people have for centuries used cooperative economics to survive. Judging from some of the ugly, hateful and vile comments about our people I am more determined now to show if we pool our resources, we will have our own again. We are looked at as jokes in this country. Remember Black Wall street.. We did it before, we can do it again. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is so shocking to me how brilliant Ben Carson in his career and so ignorant and naive in other areas. The contrast is bizarre. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Liberals are scared because Ben Carson is the personification of everything wrong with the liberal belief system and he is crumbling their whole world down <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Liberals are racist because they contemptibly treat black people like children and dont think their capable of succeeding without government assistance conservatives treat blacks like adults equal to them, thats why they get upset with the behaviour in the black community Liberals are scared because Ben Carson is the personification of everything wrong with liberals beliefs and he is crumbling their whole world down <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
teddy, teddy, teddy, read the book and then maybe you can have an intelligent conversation instead of going off on a childish temper tantrum. great job DR. CARSON. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Carsons chill attitude haha. Every interview I watch you can tell the interviewers become frustrated that they cant a reaction out of him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That is offensive to a lot of people. So what? SO WHAT?! They should not have the right not to be offended. And Islam IS a way of living. CNN idiots proves yet again they are absolutely clueless. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this guys gonna be the next hitler man.....just not as smart as hitler <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
when he summed his point of view at the end with extraordinary clarity, the speaker shut his face. if your belief requires you to put aside the Constitution as the supreme rule of law, then your not fit. and a devout, unbending Muslim would never be president. but in Islam, you are not Muslim unless your are devout. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
oh what what carson been readin up on his foreign policy way to go dude <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what is in carsons right ear? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Murdoch didnt say anything wrong. Obama is a half breed. Ben Carson is a Black man. Truth is truth. A white woman cant have a black child. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Smack down of epic proportions. I like Carson, and will vote for him if hes the Republican nominee. And while I am more of a Rubio guy, its good to see Carson push back like that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Vote Carson!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow... Dr. Carson says, speaking of Vladimir Putin, We need to oppose him..., We need to challenge him everywhere in the world..., We have to get in his face.... Keep this in mind Dr. Carson, Vladimir Putin is NOT Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gaddahfi, or any other pushover in the middle east! However, statements like that makes my mind realize just how very close we are to the Ezekiel 3839 war. Take out your Bibles and read todays headlines! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
PS Carson IS ON TARGET. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wolf Blitzer is a clown who Id ill equipped to besmirch a man like Ben Carson. all he is doing is making it obvious the he represents a pointed agenda. You lose CNN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont care what the man says it only makes him seem more human because he has his own opinion that hes not afraid to share and hes not trying to say what he thinks everyone wants to hear. Thats what i like about trump and carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson made this guy look like an Ass hat <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

F the media in this country.

Dr. Carson is logical. Why are the majority of the media clearly against Dr. Carson?! Any argument and explaination can be twisted so badly that the end result does not even come close to what was originally said. I stand with Ben. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No, Ben Carson! You just stand there and die! Stop hurting my feelings! Ugh... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Communitariat? The reporter starts off with a Marxistspeak word. No wonder they think the normal things the top candidates are saying are controversial. The way Trump and Carson are talking are controversial only to the Marxist media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Doctor Carson is an amazing, intelligent, honest and fearless individual. I think hes a fantastik person in every sense of the word but in all honesty, Id rather see him as VP for a president Rubio or Jeb Bush. I may seem blunt...but after almost 8 years of this Obamanation Abomination in the White House, I would not like to see another A.A. prez right now. Nobama has spoilt it for me. I know I may get backlash for this comment but I thats how I feel right now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

also, ben carson, THE HOMOSEXUALS need someone to SAVE THEM FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL MUSLIM PRESIDENT OMGgz. PLEASE HELP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I see nothing wrong that Carson said, armed people would make you think twice about trying to hurt someone. If people had been armed back in WW2 , maybe the outcome would of been different. All schools should have armed staffs , that would at least assure a rapid response to any potential shooter. Carson is a smart man and to make him out as an idiot, is shameful on behalf of media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I noticed that Dr. Ben Carson doesnt like to be wrong or listen to other and I find that attitude disrespectful. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank you, Carson. That is so white of you to allow a Muslim as president so long as they dont place their religion above others. As with JFK in 1960? 55 years ago? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
yeah right know it is not a problem now fucking nigger o i thought the bible doesnt like gay either fucking ass nigger how can a black man called ben carsom carson is his boss slaveowner <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wolf and cnn are trash. Dr Carson didnt take the bait leftist liberals outraged now good him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a hypocrite, a creep, a terrible American and human being, shame on those of you who promote this carson man. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is a very reasonable and intelligent man. Best choice for President of the United States of America! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a disgusting politician with no backbone, he wont answer questions that he can answer because heknows that the answers will reveal his true nature and intellect. He wont denounce racist Murdoch and you can take it that he definitely is not going to help African americans, do not vote for this horrible politician if you americans have an ounce of intelligence. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes not as smart as he gives himself credit for <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson sees reasonable to me. However, Blitzer seems irritated he cant get the response he wants. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is awsome! He answered all those questions with reason, intellect and respect. The man knows what freedom is! He would make an awesome president. Dr Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good choice, Dr. Carson ! But I still dont like you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im sure Carson is a nice guy but I doubt his ability to be President due to his lack of political or even business experience. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson handles himself with intelligence...such a breath of fresh air. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Honestly Ben Carson seems like a fucking idiot <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We have to give this guy credit. The liberal establishment which owns social media and hollywood tried to destroy this man. But he is becoming more refined and calm tempered. This is bravery, fighting the establishment group think and defying the SJWs who are out to kill your character. My hands are up, give me him or Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The interviewer sounds fucking stupid throughout the whole video how long does it take a actual American interviewer to understand Ben Carsons view and truth of what requires to be a politician in the U.S. and the white guy still not fucking get what is like for a type of level Muslim living in the U.S. who praises sharia Islamic laws which the American constitution does not go by that standards and ways. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the opposite of Obama. hes got my support. I think he will lead the polls soon <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As well as being an uncle Tom and an apologist for a country that has oppressed non whites since its founding on stolen land, Carson is also batshit crazy. Denies evolution there is footage on here, its real and also believes homosexuality is a choice. Hes a fundamentalist right wing nut...has lots in common with backward loony folk. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i like ben carson but everybody is copying trump even hilary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

At least she is honest. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Another CNN FAIL to bring Carson down! Mr Carson made him look like a fool! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is just sad. This interviewer is desperately trying to create controversy and Dr. Carson, smart man he is, is not falling for it. At around 200, he asks him why he cant just simply say Obama is a Christian it is quite clear that one cannot know someone elses beliefs, only what one says is hisher beliefs. Dr. Carson answers, very logically, that can he can only answer at his word. What else is there to it??? Why does this interviewer continue asking the same dumb question? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow crazy people are every where...Ben Carson is nuts.......... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats a ridiculous statement. The Polish people were armed when the Nazis rolled in and yet 2.9 million Jewish people died there despite the fact guns were owned by many private citizens. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He absolutely owned Blitzer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yay! Were playing the black card again! Wolf, you are a douchebag. This race war was was created by the government to keep the division going. Throwing some religion in for good measure... nice move! CNN, youre a complete JOKE! The presidential race is a hoax...its been rigged for years! You know it, I know it...and LOTS of people are finally waking up to it! Carson is smart enough to know that as wellso hes just part of the game too. #TTFD <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whats the point in riding his ass about this if Chris Mintz, the guy who did just that without help, is now being hailed as a hero. Is this idiot really trying to suggest that just sitting there waiting to get killed is the better option? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is Carson Black? Damm I guess I have to reconsider voting for him..Trump and Carson that way the Black guy has a white Vice President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson has a clear point. Its obvious that CNN and the rest of the media has a specific agenda though. By asking the same question different ways doesnt make the reporter look any more intelligent. CNN had to cut the interview short so they dont look like complete idiots. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like the way Ben Carson talks. Hes right!!! Why didnt Hitler invade Switzerland??,,,Maybe because ,,,Everybody and their mom possessed a machine gun!!! He is talking about historical facts. Only an ignorant fool will will argue the facts! Wolf Blitzer needs to go back in time,, A nice Jewish concentration camp would serfice.. Witch one??? HUMMMMM. There are so many to choose from... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Even Saying that America needs a REAL black president only adds fuel to the racial divide in this country And How could Obama not be a real black president what qualifies someone to be truly black <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson how a grown up responds to jibes. Compare to the shrillness of Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is right about WWII Holocaust guns Today in Israel every citizen has weapons training.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Screw all these OFFENDED PEOPLE! NO. ONE gives a shit about your OPINION EXCEPT the news media who kept interviewing people until they found ONE person who they could use against Carson! They do the same with Trump! THE NEWS MEDIA ARE COMMUNIST ASSHOLES! TRUMP 2016! NO MORE PRESIDENT PUPPETS! TRUMP 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It seems like hes trying to irritate or catch some controversial statement from Ben Carson. Its not journalism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I get it. Obama is black, yet ignores race relations. Wolf is trying to box Ben in and Im impressed in how he wont take the bait. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think they the republican party have stuffed a mind control implant so far up this mans ass . Now Obama isnt black ! For all the people with 7 years of pent up frustation over black bama, Dr. Ben Carson famed doctor cannot conclusivly confirm obamas blackness. So I guess all the racial hatered was all for nothing . So sad <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Newsflash Murdochs companies are more successful under democratic presidencies. Murdoch loves the upheaval. This comment, seemingly to boost Carson, has a secret agenda. He knows Carson doesnt have a chance, and so he prefers him as the GOP nominee <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
thats not going to happen ben carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Who gives a fuck if the president is black or religious what a bunch of stupid motherfuckers <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is not being honest, not telling the truth, in stupid hope to get votes of people who wont vote for him anyway. And those same morons will later be quoting his lie as fact <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson questions the US giving up slavery and calls the civil rights act completely pointless. If you are black and you live in America, you should know its a racist country and business are always looking for ways to cut costs. We should have waited until America found some other people they could convince the public that deserves to be owned and work for free. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

thumbs up MR. CARSON! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have respect for the achievements of Carson as a black man being born around the time of segregation. Its very disappointing he bring his religious beliefs into the public square where it doesnt belong. He seems like a very sober measured man who loves his country. Good president material if he dropped the religious hocus pocus. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BLITZER, YOU CANT BASH MR CARSON, HE 50 TIMES SMARTER THEN YOUR DUMB ASS. NO ONE AT CNN EVEN SLIME BALL ZUCKER CAN COME CLOSE. ALL YOU LIBERALS KEEP PISSING YOUR PANTS, IT IS FUNNY AS HELL. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am really starting to like MR. CARSON now! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is saying we need the Voting Rights Act signed into law by President LBJ. Without it, the South loses it mind and try to take us back 60 years to Jim Crow. Look whats happening now in Alabama. They have voter ID laws but they also closed down the DMVs in predominately black counties. Now black people will have to drive 4 hours across the state and back to get a drivers license state issued ID. Thats voter suppression. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson will go down in history as the stupidest smart person to ever run for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON DOES NOT BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION. nuff said. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is 100000% RIGHT... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol how is Carson in 2nd. He is a nice guy, but he is lifeless, clueless. Donald Trump is the only candidate in 2016 !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is it ok for a Christian to be president in a Muslim country? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

no one can argue witht this mans logic!! wow!! he is so calm, thoughtful and collected....remarkable! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if only we were as smart as Ben Carson. #bensosmart <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Amazing how the media cant even understand common sense anymore. Go Carson Go Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if trump or carson do not become president Im outta here <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will not vote for Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr.ben Carson what a calm guy lol you know hes irrattaded <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That depends Mr. Carson. Depends on the type of gun. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The problem is until you get put in that situation you cant explain how you would react. What mr Carson said was insensitive. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There is no good Democrats running....so Im not watching the democrat debate. Bernie is a crazy socialist and Hilarry is a lying fool. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This Kurt guy and Carson werent there. They should keep their mouths shut until they learn more about the victims. The victims were young people and dont have the experience thy have. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cant stand this black phony and his stupid voice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like carson he makes me sleepy when he talks kinda a Morgan Freeman voice...but still have to go with trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a regressive moron that rejects evolution. in other words.....Americas next president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Later carson would go on to recall that it was not a gun,but a black piece of Licorice. But seriously,how could anyone support a man that does not believe in evolution? one day in the near future it will be unthinkable to support anyone that claims to be religious for it will be seen as a sign of mental weakness. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think he is so right, although a situation like this is pretty extreme. People should be educated to react the way Mr. Carson put it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a brilliant brain surgeon, has a movie based on his life and made evident by the way hes the first surgeon to separate 2 conjoined twins by the head. That said, he should have probably stayed in the medical profession rather than going into politics. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Glad Carson went down the right path by not choosing the thug life. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP CARSON would be a badass team!!! Classic Black White Duo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Carson and Trump they seem like real people who have real opinions and not like robots unlike Hillary and Jeb. But seriously Hillary creeps me out <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben carson kicked his ass <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the guy doing the interview is a total artard, I dont know that Carson could be more clear about what he is saying and I am neither a Christian or a Carson voter lol! What an Asshat Reporter <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Liberals think that islam followers are thier friends but they are in for a rude awakening. They dont think we, the people, understand what Mr. Carson is saying. They dont get it because they are blinded with all the wrong ideas, they have a disease call stupidity... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Do you really think Ben Carson is going to stand up against a real gunman? You see, this is a prime example of clown that is pretending to be something theyre not in real life <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump Vs Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Putin handle Obama like a baby. Liberals would say Putin is racist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump doesnt poke any victims, he just speaks the truth, in this case Carson was clearly giving his real opinion so of course Trump will stick for him only speaking the truth. He attacked the puppet politicians <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is it me or is Ben Carson crazy? For a neurosurgeon, he sure says some fcked up things. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Ben Carson 100%! I sam Muslims that have formed ISIS have read the same Koran that the very Muslims that proclaim that their religion is only about peace! The very possibility of extremism is only a bad day away from any Muslim! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an affirmative action nigger who is only where he is because of the color of his skin. Any nigger with an IQ over 50 is given everything and every opportunity above real white full humans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Land of the sick and homo of the NRA. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you watched the last debate you saw that Trump and Carson were backing each other up and they actually high fived in the middle of the debate. I hope that was the confirmation of our next President and VP. TrumpCarson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an idiot. I rarely say this about people, but there you have it. We are not in the jungle anymore. In society we have people we pay to protect us, they are called policemen. A failed politician will always blame the citizens for their mistakes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh Mark you are so annoying. Carson did not say to storm the shooter is THE SOLUTION but that is what he would do in the case. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson already spoke on Gun Laws He said nothing about the Victims. He only said what he would do. . . Because YOU ASKED! CNN Biased Media, controlled, propaganda. Trying to get rid of your second amendment while TPP, which was done in secret, potentially takes away your First amendment. Its all about control <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Here we go again. CNN biased News were Carsons comments Victim Shaming The Answer No. CNN you dummies, he answered your question in one of your earlier videos. He said NOTHING about them. He only sad what he would do And why the fuck are you questioning Carson saying he isnt talking or focused on Gun Laws when he fucking spoke on them already! Focus CNN FOCUS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson creeps me out for some reason <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
there is nothing wrong with Carsons comments <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A Fearless leader like Ben Carson is what America needs and deserves. The CIA lame stream media should stick to what it does best. Creating False Flag Fear Porn Hoaxes that nobody believes and barely watches anymore. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is excellent! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben carson is right! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN is shameless for even suggesting this. Ben Carson was 100% correct to say people should fight active shooters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
how can another say what another mans actions would be who tf is he lol ... how does he know that Ben carson has never been shot at or had a gun pulled on him before you dont know his life! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For a man without medical knowledge Trump is pretty good on this, Dr Carson essentially put the same solution as him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thumbs down to CNN, thumbs UP for Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, at least he has a good plan. Would have been better than taking pot shots at Carson. The surgeon probably has pretty good odds of keeping a clear head in this situation relatively speaking. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Ben Carson. He is saying what he would do. Lindsey may have been in the military, but he has never been in a classroom faced with a gunman. So, he needs to shutup. People like him talk big, but they nit pick what ever Ben Carson says. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is so full of shit! Oh by the way, if I was in France, I would have gotten an award too for stopping a terrorist. Because I am such a heman. What a stupid fucker! This guy has the movements of a tortoise. And the shooter in Oregon didnt like blacks. What a fucking asshole to say I would be a hero too Did this guy remove his own brain? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Hilary because i think she will lose more easily against the republicans because of her emails and she is not the most likable. I hope either Dr Carson or Mr Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Perhaps we should wish that the brave people who stopped that flight from reaching the White house on 911 should have not done so then. Everything this government does is to further undermine real freedom and to create a nation of sheep who will never even question their governments true intentions. Then CNN scratches their heads as to why Trump keeps climbing in the polls??? TrumpCarson 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont agree w Lindsey Graham on much of anything but I agree w him on this. Carson is a fool and has no idea what hed do besides piss his underoos <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets look at this logically. Ben Carson gave us a plan which can work. Planning is everything. If people listen to this it would possibly change the outcome of a future attack. Graham is an idiot only looking for an opportunity to advance himself. He obviously has no plan and can not recognize what a plan of action is. Graham would choke in a serious situation. Dont vote for this fool. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And he smiles like a fuckin asshole in the end <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bullshit PC police line of questions based on a topic that plays off of the lack of an educated populace. Mad respect for the Ben Carson campaign manager who told them to fuck off at the end of the video. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im behind Ben Carson 100 %! Hes very capable of being President of the United States. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This interviewer knows little about the tenets of Islam. Ben Carson has it right. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN would do themselves a huge favor and a great service to the viewers by sending the interviewer back to school. Apparently he does not have a clue of what Sharia Law is all about, and on top of that he tries to make a case for it. Go Carson go! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Maybe Carson knows this was a fake shooting and doesnt feel it warrants a detailed answer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think the answer Carson gave was great .... I dont know if he would actually do that but at least he gave an actual answer instead of a line of PC crap...... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A brilliant surgeon does not automatically equal qualified to be president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
they wanna know what theyre going to do about disproportionate incarceration rates for African Americans Well why dont YOU and blacklivesmatter address the disproportionate CRIME rates in the black community? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Talk about dense, this reporter just cant get past the word Muslim to see the full context of Dr. Carsons statement. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well from the looks from the conspiracy theories looks like they got a good case a if next president does a full investigation who going to be left holding the bag if I was those people I think their be worried about that for the rest of their lives never know???? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
do not put another criminal Clinton back into the white house. that will bring the head of the crime family along with her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you listen to Carsons position, he really does not waiver nor is he put into a corner to surrender. I thought he articulated his position well and did not compromise the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Freedom from religion, Carson cant be thrusted either. And yes America is in a better position now then when the bushes was in power.and have been around for yrs.and seen how the republicans treated Americans. All about themselves. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
we just gonna ignore that hes a damn communistsocialist. Some of you should know by nowespecially immigrants that his policies would not work. we dont need another 4 years of a failed president, we need someone like Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson and donald trumpy trump trump will definitely not be president, thats a fact already <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson, Allah Himself wont let a racist man like yourself be President, since you hate Muslims and the fastest growing religion in the world Islam, Allah will punish you like hell! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats DR BEN CARSON. keep up the great work Dr!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:2> <-emoji:0>
I like Trump, but also Carson, for me its going to come down to one of those two for the Rep. Nomination for President. As a Baltimorian we know Carson real well being Johns Hopkins is here in Bmore and all the great work he has done, we need a man with a brain in the WH period not a bunch of promises! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Maybe Tapper should move to more Conservative Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, or Afghanistan. I think then that pussy will understand the subjugation Dr. Carson was talking about. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes actually not giving Carson a chance... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this guy and ben carson, I dont even know who is worse.I guess carson is dumber coz he is more intelligent which makes him so confused and dumb. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh! Dr.Carson your kindness and intent shine. Thank you for your understanding and sharing of it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
....the media will twist and spin whatever will draw ratings, they are the extremists. Wonder if this network will address how Awad of CAIR violated Federal Revenue regulations by asking Carson to step out of race. Americans are smarter than they know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb is loosing out to Sanders, Trump, Clinton and Carson. Good luck. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sheriff writes to Biden opposing gun control after Sandy Hook. Sandy Hook is repeated in his town 2.5 years later. Breitbart promises to expose Obama March 5th, dies at midnight on March 5th, his coroner dies a month later. Ben Carson opposes Obama, get audited by the IRS. Jennifer Gallagher, nurse who helped victims at Aurora shooting and met Obama, drowned a month later. And on, and on... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Activist reporters are not true journalists. This guy wanted to preach at Carson, not listen to his responses. He should be fired. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Idiotic trump no one will vote him for president #Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Reflect on the sheer idiocy of having state by state differences in the application of the death penalty ! Either it is a good idea or a bad idea . Right now 31 states have it and 19 dont . Sometimes the distribution of power between the federal and state governments has worked well . I dont think that this is one of those times . Obviously , Carson supports capital punishment and should have said so . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is right on Syria and Assad...TrumpCarson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like the way Dr Carson handled this interview. He clearly has a better understanding of Muslim beliefs concerning Islam then the person conducting the interview. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant wait for America to be great again TRUMP 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Morgan freeman but Im a republican and Im not a racist <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You can tell Tapper is a democrat, he went after Trump and Carson hard yet is giving softballs to these people he supports, the male should have a say when the woman becomes pregnant, it is not her decision alone to murder <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im confused at how. They got Carson says Muslims shouldnt be president from I would not advocate a Muslim as president, I wouldnt support it. To me sounds like a very simple opinion. Doesnt seem too difficult to understand to me. He in no way said there needed to be a religious test. Im even more confused at how they are even getting i would not advocate a Muslim for president as a religious test. Just stupid. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think if you asked Dr Carson if his comment was directed at white liberals he would say that it was not. If you listen to the context of his conversation on the radio show clip, he is referring to those persons who expect him to think a certain way because he is African American. On a related note, journalism is supposed to get to the facts. I believe that is still possible, but we have to get over the reactionary bashing and counterbashing being attempted by this news story... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is Ben Carson always high? He sounds like hes on drugs. Probably cause hes mentally incompetent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson makes some very good points. Im honestly shocked that this reporter has not understood these statements, when the question was answered multiple times. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If i could vote now, id vote for ben carson, hes seems more understanding <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Tapper, no matter how many times, no matter how many ways he asked Dr. Carson the same question and tried to trip him up, Dr. Carson answer with wisdom and integrity. You got my vote Dr. Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These comments make me fear for the future of this nation. People would rather hear petty arguments over intellectual debates. Carson always has a calm, collective demeanor and it seems to piss people off. I actually enjoy it very much. We need someone who can make rational decisions under pressure, unlike trump who goes on a tangent anytime he disagrees with someone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bless Ben Carson, fuck CNN, fuck islam, sharia is a filthy throw back pig religion.this interview guy is an antagonist piece of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The comments section. Holy shit. Obama could say drinking water is good for you and people would come out and talk about a conspiracy on the American people to fatten the pockets of bottled water companies. You Obama haters disgust me. Its one thing to disagree with someone, but to demonize them the way you have is just ridiculous and doesnt help us grow as a species <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bravo Dr. Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is absolutely right. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I thought CNN was reputable and it is clear that they have an agenda to make Carson look like a bigot. This reporter clearly tried to back Carson in a corner and he couldnt. The reporter is antagonistic. He breezes through the first couple questions and spends a bulk of his time making a case for Islam. The reporter is not patriotic and I no longer respect CNN as a reputable source. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is very intelligent. This reporter is irritating!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The interviewer had not put his listening ears on at all. Even at the end, you could see by his last his question, that he did not understand anything that Dr. Carson just said. That is called bad listening, or just foggy mind. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson is a low energy person <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow this interviewer is an ass. He is obviously trying to get Ben Carson. Fact is obama has shown us the leadership of a muslim president when within the last week at the UN he made a speech defending extremist like isis by saying that there are extremist in all religions. That is not the the kind of president we need in the US. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this reporter has no professionalism and no respect for Dr. Ben Carson or our Nation. OF COURSE WE CAN NEVER, EVER, EVER IN THE LIFE OF AMERICA can or should we have a muslim president or anyone that does not support the constitution PERIOD.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a Scumbag and needs to be called out! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is it so hard to understand what he is saying for many people? If one does not obide by the constitution they should not be president no matter what religion one believes in, but the Quran has many values that contradict the constitution. If Muslims are not willing to reject those teachings in the Quran that contradict the constitution then they should plain and simple not be president of the United States. Again this goes for anyone but the question was asked about Muslims. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not a Carson supporter, but the reporter was trying to get Dr. Carson to mess up with his pressing of the Islam issue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Reference to Trump saying Carson was an okay doctor. Kinda like the likeable enough gaffe with HilaryBarack <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jake, Failed Kindergarden quit learning its why hes @ cnn... The Genius, Dr. Ben Carson, the kid from the Detroit Ghetto SOFTLY CALMLY TORE JAKE to SHREDS here. Jake cant handle interviewing anyone of Dr. Carsons Intellect, Morals, Faith or Ethics.. Great Demeanor, Dr. Ben. CLASSIC CLASS !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is so right on this issue! Congrats to him! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
truump talking more bullshit, and the amerikans buying it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How is it hard to understand that Dr Carson means you need to be loyal to the USA more than your religion since you will be the president of a nation with people of diverse culture and background, which by the way is the soul of the USA , diversity. Liberals hate it when christian church are against gay marriage, hey have you asked what Muslims think about gay marriage? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson Anyone who wants a theocracy, I cannot support. CCN So it sounds like you are talking about Muslims. Carson Not just Muslims ... Anyone! CCN Got it ... Muslims, wow some controversial stuff from Mr. Carson. Next up, why do crayons taste purple? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This interviewer is so annoying, repeat, repeat, repeat! Hes obviously trying to trip up Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
at least he is saying a certain segment of Muslims are bad instead of everyone of them like everyone else. Keep mind that we have 5 Muslim allies and in Saudi Arabia they practice those malicious executions. Using Muslims that are killing other Muslims to say all of them are bad is like saying the same thing for black people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a dumb ass jerk <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Islam is the problem. Islam is a dangerous ideology like nazism. There are some muslims who are very nice just like there were some nazis who where very nice this does not mean the ideology is good because there are good people. Muslims are a victim of their ideology but only they can decide to make a change and give up this ideology. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shout it from the roof tops Ben Carson. Because the truth is going to set America free. Well the ones that wake up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Although Tapper is a leftie, I dont blame him for the Islam thing. Carson should have just said the religion of Islam itself is the problem and that itself disqualifies any Muslim as president, unless heshe strongly utterly rejects all the bad things in Islam. No wonder Tapper was confused with all the rhetorical bullshit from Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson owned Strickland like a slave lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This interviewer does not understand basic English. How does one not understand what Dr. Carson said, even after he repeated it several times. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for President. lol. the CNN media is psycho! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson future POTUS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im stuck between trump and Carson... They are both great men. I LOVE how Ben Carson will get rid of IRS, hes a TRUE man of freedom. But trump is a moneymaker and great businessman.. Im all for less governent.. IM LEANING TOWARDS CARSON!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This interview is typical. That is, big media typically focusing on tangential issues vs the important things like the economy, education and keeping America number 1. Carson is a typical politician, not skilled in taking over the conversation and refocusing on the important issues. The only candidate that exhibits the capacity to control the conversation is Bernie Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This leftwing idiot that is interviewing ben Carson should move out of the United States never come back! The interviewer is a true idiot! Ben Carson is a genius he is a true patriotic American I love him... I hope that he runs as Donald Trumps vice presidential candidate! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson, what a pompous smug jerk. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is the same interviewer that told Marcus Luttrell that the death of his comrades was senseless. Hes a flaming liberal and staunch apologist of Muslims. If he thinks Carson said something he shouldnt have, its only because he has insight into doing that exact thing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bastard, He doesnt deserve to be president of this wonderful free Christian country... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson, you fail at Islam. Theres no Central Authoritarian group in Islam, unlike other religions. Hence its strength and weakness. Its open source and not centralized. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thanks CNN, you just help Mr. Carson gain and family of support with your tactics. Now we have clarification of his statement. I really wish you guys would really report news in it entirety instead of doing sabotage clips. One day you guy may make it back to a station I watch again. hmmm We go from Pope Francis who I have a great love for in my heart to trying to trip Mr. Carson up. REALLY! Pay attention the man is a thinker. He know what he will say before it comes out of his mouth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nicely done Dr. Carson! Even though this guy tried to entrap you by asking the same baited question in 70 different ways, you maintained poise and and eloquently verbalized the logic behind your reasoning. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dogs lawyer released the following statement in their defence..it was fake!! Now ive got to catch my tail. The bird is voting for Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why The FUCK Would I Vote A Muslim In Office? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone notice Ben Carson takes mini naps when he talks? lol look at how often he closes his eyes! Its hard NOT to notice now! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is supposed to be an interview of a Presidential candidate? these issues wouldnt even be raised in a City Council election. wtf. dont ask softball questions just because Ben Carson is an idiot. show the world how dumb he is so i dont have to listen to his pseudo intellectual ass anymore <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Face it folks ,,,,, Ben Carson will be the next President if you all vote for him !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson made some rather ridiculous claims about Muslims and Islam and wouldnt provide evidence for it.. Rather he keeps pointing fingers when he in fact should look at his own understanding and doctrine before pointing fingers. Shame on him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a fucking idiot time for the US to stop pushing these idiots He makes Carson look like a genius and this clown thinks the planet is only 6000 years old <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the only rational candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson was asked the question he did not bring this up out of the blue. These media people are idiots. Especially this one. Ben hit this dumb shit in the mouth he has earned a good ass kicking. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I feel like Putin and TrumpCarson Would become best friends lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nice. The whole interview was about Muslims being in presidency.. Oh CNN... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is living proof you dont need a competent mind to have a steady hand... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Has Ben Carson publicly renounced all of the horrible parts of his very own Christian Bible? Ive yet to hear him say he has... Why should a Muslim have to make that renouncement if a Christian doesnt? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
paul or carson. Id take either. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a thumping Trapper took. How pathetic was his attempt to destroy Dr. Carson on the issues of advocating for a Muslim president. He should have just said that ANY extreme religious president would be in conflict with the U.S. Constitution <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does anyone notice how long Carson keeps his eyes close? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ok so the media would be ok with their ability to create the news being silenced? Dr. Carsons statements are being twisted to make him look like he is saying something he is not!!! I think the media needs to get back to the basics of reporting news. They are misrepresenting the news and slanting it to say what they want it to to get the result they want! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Disqualified! These are easiest GED questions and his brilliant ass cant answer them correctly. Dr. Carson, you rock as neurosurgeon but never President of the US. Jake Tapper is tossing softballs and Dr. Carson keeps striking out because hes lacks an understanding of the US Constitution. Facepalm <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I DONT HATE ANYONE BUT ISLAM SHARIA LAW GOTTA GO. BEN CARSON GETS MY APROVE ON THIS BUT I STILL AM VOTING FOR TRUMP <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
sadly carson hasnt spoken much about fixing the free trade, thats just one reason for why I favor trump over carson. casting it away with thats nothing new doesnt help <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im white. and the white man that spoke I dont trust. I trust reality and reality is by carson, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THANK YOU DR BEN CARSON FOR SPEAKING THE TRUTH!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON ALL THE WAY FOR PREZZZZZ!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well done DR Ben Carson. The interviewer is such a idiot . He seem to be getting lost in his own words. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr. Trapper was doing his job, which imo had nothing to do with journalism but an attempt to vilify Dr. Carson by repeatedly asking the same question which Dr. Carson answered each time with patience, gentleness and respect, virtues well worth cultivating. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Man that was hard to watch. I can bet that Tapper was going to talk about the ironyhypocrisy of Carsons view on Islam. Far right conservatives put their religion Christianity mostly and say it is the ethos we should all be subjected to. How is that any different from his perspective of what a Muslim would do? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What an stupid smart person, you couldnt even just run the entirety of our military with a flat 14.5% tax rate. Economists are just face palming at these tax plans from Sen. Paul and Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fucking Christ..... this interviewer is a crock of shit. He knows very well what Carson just told him, but he wants to continue baiting the subject again and again to manipulate viewers... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youre a peasant lady. You got no right to talk to Fiorina that way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The White House , is pressuring the armed forces to inject more woman and people of color to the military , yet woman cant do what men can do . Female individuals cant be us army Rangers , I bet they are going to adept a double standard, in every section . We will soon find female navy seals or delta operators , which will make our sf a joke . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson cant stand the heat! #feelthebern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This man has INTEGRITY something that is so lacking in Washington DC. HE is a man of immense character and would make a TREMENDOUS President. I truly hope America wakes up and makes the right choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN people with that less understandings? They dont know what Dr. Carson is saying? Shame on CNN media <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is absolutely right about what he is saying. The media is trying push interpret his statements in a way, that he didnt mean it. Why is CNN so biased. Im from germany. So Im not familiar with the news in the USA. But we have the same problems here in Germany. If I was an American citizen I would vote for Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh god, hes starting to take himself seriously! Hes going to be in for a rude awakening... Hes already got crowds booing him and his polling numbers are falling. I dont think hell take it well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jake Tapper did an excellent job in this interview. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So even though the Planned Parenthood videos were proven to be fakes, this moron still wants an investigation? Its people like Carson and Trump thats making the rest of the world laugh at you America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson I wouldnt fucking vote for muslim president, would you? Jake Uhh thats not politically correct. People Fuck PC <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There is a separation of Church and State. Even Dr. Carson doesnt get it. Hes prejudice and probably racist as well <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson, imma let you finish, but Trumps the best candidate and he needs to be the prez. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shut up Carson, Im tired of hearing about Muslims. We already know you dont like them, so how about a tax plan that isnt based on the Bible? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No matter what the religion is if it contradicts the constitution then they should not be president, Muslim is just one of those religions, its just an example he isnt saying just Muslims cant be president he is say any religion that goes against our constitutions beliefs shouldnt lead our nation. I swear these people are trying to start drama and gossip even Carson pointed out that its the media that is trying to make it a bigger thing than it actually is <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson talks weird and blinks odd. bothers me <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These guys are Bad Dudes? Sooooo Presidential. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow. Carson is really pissin off the elite <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson was treated so unfairly. But, I wish he had stayed through the end of the interview and overruled the staffer. Then if CNN continued to be unfair, make the decision on his own to leave explaining he gave them a chance to continue the interview fairly. Same dumb question over and over. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That guy tried to get a rise out of him, but failed miserably. Way to go Ben Carson! The media are scum <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That MORON knew exactly what Carson was saying, he is just paid to be a horses rear end. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a leader and knows what he is talking about <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson makes Tapper look like a simpleton....I love it......Tapper you are a HACK. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
go Carson, CNN just trying to make a story out of something that is there <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Can anybody please show me a Muslim American WHO DOESNT HATE AMERICA AND EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny that Ben Carson needs someone else to step in and tell him when the interview is over. he cant just redirect the conversation, or even say it for himself. Its like his mom came in and ended a play session early to take him home before that dirty CNN kid put bad ideas in his head. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP CARSON 2016 ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Tappers willful ignorance of the realities of Islam is palpable. Im sick of this lisping lamebrain assuming the worst about those who, like Ben Carson, dont wear PC blinders and recognize what Islam is. Hes a perfect fit for CNN. Never let the truth stand in the way of advancing the BS PC narrative. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson President 2016!!!!! Dont let them twist your words Ben. We all know what you mean and we dont want a Muslim president either who wouldnt reject the tenets of Islam. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This interviewer reminds me of Johnny Depp on Pirates of the Carreabean, yes, but wheres the rum? This stupidity is hilarious. Like Mr Carson pointed out, the American people get what he meant, its the media dragging this issue. Ben Carson should refuse to clarify this question ever again. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The guy Jake cant even look Ben Carson in the eye for longer than a minute <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for President!!! May God Bless America And May God Bless Him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy from CNN is so dumb. Ben Carson knows what hes talking about. This guy knows nothing about Islam or Sharia Law. CNN needs to educate their people and stop them from telling lies. Yes, the American people understand what Carson is saying. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That reporter is working really hard to start some shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I remember seeing Jack Kennedy saying he would reject the Catholic ideology and submission to the Pope if he were elected President...Carson is saying the same thing...If your gonna be President you have to swear your alliance to the Constitution...Not the Quran. If you cant separate the two then you shouldnt be p President. Pretty simple...So simple even CNN should understand <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not to sure how much more Carson has to clarify his statements. Its pretty clear what he is saying any religion with an implemented government structure should not be connected to the leaders of the United States because that means the leader would have to implement hisher spiritual beliefs on the governments heshe is leading.... Not complicated. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Best way to waste a valuable time Carson is to go to these pigs mud puddle. You play with them, you get some mud. On the other hand, Liberal media as being revealed, a sickness of retardation <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well done, Carson. CNN the rest of the left are getting this all wrong. They think theyre living in some French, socialist shithole thats obsessed with political correctness. If they keep up this Islamophobia nonsense, they will have 40 red states and a Trump as president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow great job Dr. Carson. dont let these dumb liberals get to you. you have more brains than any of them. glad to see reasoning and logic running for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This video annoyed the fuck out of me. Congrats for Carson for having the patience to go as long as he did <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carsons biggest problem is low IQ. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a truly scary person. Clearly has no understanding of religious freedom and has trouble answering a simple question. Cant let a man like this become president. Hopefully this is the start of his demise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need someone with more energy. I dont think Dr. Carson can sell his agenda to anyone but his true believers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson defended his position quite well. Tapper compromised journalistic ethics by continuously hurling mudballs and not responding to any of Dr. Carsons rebuttals. I expect Tapper will never be asked to moderate another presidential debate for the rest of his career. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Reporter is an idiot, how many times did Carson have to explain..once...CNN was after the next big EO scandal and Carson wouldnt fall into the trap. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN.. worthless fucks.. no wonder you have the lowest rating of any news company <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That interviewer had to have Ben Carson almost give him a lesson about the Quran and Islam..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How much more can Dr. Carson clarify and explain this. I think this CNN guy should educate himself before he took on this interview so he doesnt come off as an imbecile like he did here! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I guess he was going to ask Mr. Carson the same question until he got the answer he wanted but was not getting. Good for you Mr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I genuinely hope Dr. Carson is not our next President, but that interview got ridiculous. Next question. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is always closing his eyes. Its weird. This will hurt him in the long run. Not that it should but it will because its weird. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats because when polling muslims, most say sharia should trump the U.S. Constitution. Now CNN if you were real reporters, did research and not trying to push an agenda all the time, you would know this. Ben Carson is right! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This interviewer is stuck in such a rut how many times does Dr Carson have to explain his correct understanding of Islam and sharia , and its incompatiblility with the American Constitution ?? Yet this guy keeps going around and around with the same questions is he plain stupid ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That so called journalist was really trying to trap Dr Carson, totally ridiculous, it was a good call to the guy that pulled the plug on this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This so called Journalist should be immediately fired. TRUMPCARSON 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is clearly a weirdo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What Ben says makes entire sense, Sharia law requires that it rules over the Constitution. Liberal media is scared to death of Ben Carson and it shows <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everyone knows Sharia and the constitution are not compatible. What Ben wants is entirely reasonable and makes sense. The left is far too inept to understand this. They simply dont want another black man in office because it would destroy their whole Republicans didnt vote for Obama because hes black! bullshit they like to shovel out to all of the Dumbass dependocrats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He was very calm and crystal clear with his explaination. Whoever was interviewing him needs to shut up and move on to another question. The American people dont care about this issue. We already know Carson is correct, anyways. Stop beating your dick to the Islamophobia meme in your echo chamber and come to reality. This guy ruined a potentially good interview, it started out that way at least. Not even bothering to know his name. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Republicans try to shoot down any program for the poor. This lady asked, how are you going to take care of these unwanted kids, since you dont support social programs? No answer. But we all know they really dont give a damn. Lets see , take away your health care, no minimum wage hikes, cut funding for everything. She is one of the austerity candidates. More and more for the wealthy. Less for everyone else. We get it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
suck a dick, CNN lmao couldnt arson the carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who the fuck is Ben Carson? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How the hell does Jake Tapper have a job? Tapper asked Carson the same question for over five minutes straight, and wouldnt accept the logical answer proposed by Carson. CNN is pathetic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He made his case let move one, to the liberal media you are not going to change people ideals all ready, we have enough problems beside this liberal agenda to put down Mr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good for Carson CNN pushing its far left agenda <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson, the persistent asking of the same question and the implication of the wording of the question is a trap to make you appear that you hate Muslims. Do not fall for such dishonest tactics, answer the question once and when asked again, let him know you already addressed that and ask if he has any other questions. CNN, lets stop the dishonest questioning with malicious intent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
thats unprofessional of the interviewer, IMHO. How is Carson assuming theyre putting their religion ahead of the constitution? in this interview <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This dumb interviewer keeps accusing Dr Carson of assuming, the problem is hes assuming just as much if not more. He claims to know many muslims, but does he know what their koran says. I doubt it, Dr Carson did an excellent job of showing the world how deceptive CNN and other media are. Ill vote for Dr Carson just because the media is working so hard to lynch this black man in the court of public opinion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Will Carson leave in the middle a debate if hes asked the same questions? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson for President. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i could really listen to carson and fall asleep.....so relaxing and soothing! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
...no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. Ben Carson is antiConstitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an idiot and anyone that supports him is a numbskull! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The way Mr. Carson is talking... it strikes me as very odd... He seems like hes suffered some sort of brain damage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You would have to be blind not to see that CNN is trying to paint a twisted picture of Carsons remarks. This is not honest journalism, I mean you can see this hack trying to put words and narratives in Carsons mouth. As Carson clarifies his position, and it doesnt seem far fetched, CNN jumps in to create the story you should believe. I have never seen an interview with Obama nor Clinton that pushed them for anything from CNN, they are too busy hero worshiping them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Maybe Ben Carson is sexually attracted to both sexes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There are about 1.6 billion Muslims on the planet. 1.4 billion reportedly believe women are obligated to obey their husbands like they are secondclass citizens. 1 billion reportedly support Sharia Law. But youre totally right, CNN, Carson is just using extremists to attack a religion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
most people who dont like Obama are predjudice and have a mental and emotional complex about difference of race. They may as well have a complex about a box of crayon. They attack the messenger because this message is quite humane. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is 100 percent right. Quit the badgering questioning. Dummy says I dont know any Muslims who want a theocracy. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAA Is he fucking serious!? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson kicked his ass!! lmaoooooo <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
YAY Carson! over and over and over he explained so EVEN I understood what he meant, and yet this bovine interviewer continues to twist, and hope and vapidly accuse him of hate..what a cunt <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ben Carson... I really do. But, I just dont know about the way he speaks. Its as if hes about to fall asleep all the time! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn, how many times does he need to answer the same question? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THIS GUY is a leading Republican candidate for President? Holy Christ... I thought Trump was a doofus. This guys barely fucking coherent. The average IQ in the Republican Party has to have slipped below 75 thats the only logical explanation for these idiots being considered viable presidential candidates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You brain dead liberals that watch CNN cant even comprehend Ben Carson. That is the side effect of having concrete skulls <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson using logic like a scalpel and cutting through the bullshit spewed by the media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is HONEST,BRILLIANT something that our current politicians are not. He would make a Tremendous President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What is with his eyes? He looks like a child molester who desperately needs to take a shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
love me some Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the most stupid interviwer i have ever seen, i am sure he is very offended by Carsons statement what ashame , i can see he is an exstreme. muslim , <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for president. We need him America <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I just wanted to punch this fucking left wing pussy journalist!!! I would REALLY punch this shit!!!! If you are a lefty out there then you are a pussy, a cocksucking sissy advocating terrorist that wants to destroy civilized world. Islam mean submission, you left wing cocksuckers. They want to submit you or kill you including your children, you dumb fuckers. Why cant you understand this. What will take for you comprehend this? A nuclear attack? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jake Tapper the interviewer would make a better president than Ben Carson, at least Tapper understood the issues and was more coherent in his questions, then Ben Carson with his responses. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How sad that any interviewer from any news organisation is so illiterate about the subject matter he is supposed to be interviewing on. Any serious student of Islam will understand the very simple statements made by Dr Carson, that Islam is a total system of belief, behaviour and politics. Surely any halfintelligent person can understand that truth. Apart from this interviewer propagandist? apparently. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why even do interviews with CNN, seriously? Ben Carson, and I hope one day I can say President Carson, was very clear about his beliefs on this Muslim issue. Let the American people decide if they agree, who cares what CNN or some puppet reporter thinks about it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson called it, the media car more about this issue than the PEOPLE do. CNN is so sad. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doctor Carson? Withdraw from The Presidential Race... Although you may be an Incredible Neurosurgeon? You CLEARLY lack the Socially Intellectual Political Prowess to Lead such a Powerful Nation... In other words Doctor Carson? You Sir are WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE... You gave it a good try though... Big Respect for that... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for President 2016! #BC2DC16 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson was pummeled about the head, and stumbled through the ring in a dazed stagger, halfblind from numerous deep cuts. Fortunately, his manager stopped the bloodbath 8 minutes into the fight, saying from now on, nobody gets more than five minutes with the champ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im familiar with the tenants of Christianity and you Mr Carson look mighty unfamiliar <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben fell apart at the first sign of someone pressing him on his views and not letting him get away with the usual bullshit answers so his staffer angrily ended it. How dare you ask my client real questions?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Funny how some choose to uphold the perverted version of Islam practiced only by alqaedaisis and chooses to ignore the version followed by the remaining 99% of Muslims around the world. Its no different than using the Westboro church as a standard for judging Christians and Christianity across the entire world. I am an observant Muslim and a proud American. I would die to protect this country regardless of what hate or disrespect I receive. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stupid Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
of course your faith should come before the country.. ! thats besides the point.. ben carson didnt say anything wrong.. BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson Off course there is a way Tapper what is the way? Carson I dont know the way Slam Dunk !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stupid Carson and his republican morons <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson owned him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr.Carson did very well defending his stance and holding off yr medias trickery. Lets see if all the other Repubs and Dems can do the same. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If he gets nominated, all the Democratic nominee would need to do is to put Carsons comments on a feedback loop. The far right has reified Shariah law. In reality, there are many interpretations of Shariah, just as there are many interpretations of the Bible, the Talmud, and so on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When this fool, a fool can be good at one thing, went on tirade at the national prayer breakfast and criticized the President, he might have thought being a president and scrutinized is the easiest thing in the world. Here he looks like a confused toddler. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jake Tapper is a POS!! and it showed where his biased lies..... News FLASH!! Rasmussen poll ..09252015 ... Only 28% of American would vote for a Muslim President!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson successfully separated conjoined twins. I dont think pathology is Carsons field. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a Muslim, I tell Dr. Carson go fuck yourself. You are misinformed my friend <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just give up your right winged christian extremist. Your values have lost and liberalism have von. Sry you will be part of history in the same catagori like the dark age or the nazis. The republicans will never be able to win an election again and even though their is no god i would like to say thank god than Bernie Sanders will be president 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Try counting how many times this clown blinks. Good Luck. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, Carson is obviously right. However, by the same token he admitting that the beliefs of fundamentalist Christians are not compatible with the Constitution and would have to be foresworn in order to govern properly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TAPPER FUCK YOU, YOUR SHIT. MR. CARSON SPEAKS FOR THE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS HAVE HIS BACK. LOW LIFES LIKE YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO GET UP OUT OF THE GUTTER AND WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, OTHER WISE YOU ARE BREATH AIR THAT IS NOT YOURS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson will kick isis ass as president #Carson2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Media do not put their listening ears before Mr. Carson starts answering. On the same interview, this interviewer made him repeat and repeat his answer. Also, the Media could keep track of all the other interviews he gave about this question. They make some 20 interviews on the same issues. Kind of redundant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson clearly misunderstands Islam and its principals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the truth hurts. islam is not in order with the things we believe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does Ben Carson always look like hes about to sneeze ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a DISGRACE to BlackAmerica and to the Medical Profession..This Clown DOES NOT Understand anything about America...Hell be a perfect stooge for the CorporateMilitaryIndustrial Complex. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

that interviewer was a moron. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson a man who needs money needs more funding. Stoops so low to single handedly pulls a trump card. I guess he forgot his upbringing. No one wanted him to be a surgeon let alone run. Now hes making that blow to Muslim Americans. wtf Carson I can see trump doing it but you. Also again those are extremist beliefs Carson keeps pointing out. Conclusion a man who had to fight the supremacy to get to where he is stoops to be that same devil he fought against. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
At the end of the interview a someone says... this interview is over... might as well as said...the Islamic interrogation if over. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jake Tapper keeps asking question as if Ben Carson did not just answer them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson should focus on separating babies. There is no place in politics for you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fatass dyke got bitchslapped. I love this woman! Fiorina 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson did not back track!!! He is just restating what the media dares not report. THE TRUTH!!! look at the entire video not just a sliced piece of it and read the ENTIRE transcript of the interview and you will undoubtedly come to understand that Carson is saying the EXACT same thing in a different way so that the media can not twist and mislead its viewers. Some of these headlines are sooooo misleading it crazy..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr carson reached over 4 millions Facebook likes he is the only can beat Hillary. Mr trump just uses the bible to atack people so far he has not given specifics how to make america great. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look at Carsons reaction when Trump pats him at the end. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I came here for the title. The answer was simply, Probably differently. Oohhh kay, then, thank you, Doctor Carson. Now to see if I can scrounge up 8 minutes of my time.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
look at these old crowd...Even bernie sanders has young crowd..that tells you something abt the candidates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The mainstream medias attempt to denigrate Dr Ben Carson seems to have the reverse effect not to mention the backlash. theyre copping. Hey CNN, stop shooting yourself in the foot lol. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson got it right...The truth is islam holds no law but sharia law as the only one that matters. You cant serve to master and islam wants nothing more than to destroy America and Israel, in their words The big evil and little evil . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is important because Obama sold this country to the chicoms for a short future of normalcy. Welcome communism into your hearts America. Bernie Sanders will be your ultimate leader. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

media manipulates statements to create controversy and divide people in groups, please see the original source of what ben carson spoke and you will discover that media is just trying to divide people, He said that any person who does not aline with the principles of the constitution should not run for office, because it goes against what the US stands as a Nation <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is not an okay doctor. Anyone who saves over 15,000 lives is a hero. Fuck you Donald Trump. And fuck you Jake Tapper you spineless little shrivel of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Speaking your mind and the truth is not longer allowed by the Left. All opposition must be silenced and the messenger destroyed. And they dont just go after the messenger, the entire family is attacked, even the children. If you dont vote for Dr. Ben Carson You are A Racist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

According to Ben Carson all other developed countries must be like nazi Germany .All other developed nations have some form or other of single payer health systems and we do fine .We never have to pay thousands of percentage increase for prescriptions either .Only in the USA . He also thinks the earth was created in 6 days only in the USA .The world would laugh at the USA <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank God for ben carson. Finally someone to vote for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow I cant believe people are actually supporting this guy and trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Propaganda news ,Carson was speaking directly to the point of Sharia and the constitution and anyone putting Sharia over the constitution he would not want as president. The Lame stream media is just trying to turn this around into being something it is not , Shame Shame CNN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The title should be Ben Carson Backs Up His Muslim Remarks It is pretty clear that he never backtracked. The title is misleading. With that said, I fully support Dr. Carson in what he said. I myself would not advocate for anyone who could not put the US constitution above their beliefs. Sheria Law does not allow for that and for a person to actually be a faithful follower of islam. They are opposed to one another. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think the media is the only thing inciting fear and division. Also, why is this such a controversial subject? Who is running for president who is a Muslim? When did Ben Carson ever say he hated Muslims? He didnt. I feel like this controversy is being thrown at us to cause confusion and distract us from issues that are actually relevant. Ben Carson is right about one thing. The people of the United States deserve better than this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love the fact that all these GOP clowns want to censer the Pope when he wants to talk about climate change but dont want to censer Donald Trump and Ben Carson when they clearly insult Muslim Americans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Two of the greatest Progressive leaders of the 21st Century together, it great to see....... but do you know whats better? THE GOP LOOSING THEIR SHIT ABOUT IT they are going fucking nutz about it. Ben Carson lost the Muslim vote the other day now Huckabee says the Pope aint a Christian ! ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All you of you should know that Bernie Sanders beat Donald trump and Jeb Bush in a CNN poll also in a Quinipiniac poll. Hahah Ron Paul is your best chance republicans got . Ben Carson is weak af. Donald trump will look pathetic in a one on one debate. BERNIE 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I find it hilarious how hard Cooper is trying to bash Trump here. Straight attack. Just shows the establishment doesnt want him in that seat. So hes got my vote. Not that I particularly care for any of these candidates. The country is pretty much fucked at this point. However I would rather have Trump or Carson in the white house rather than any other person that has a remote chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
shhh... listen carefully... our next president is speaking <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>
sounds and looks like Donald Trump scare Ben Carson. ......Lots of respect for him...why.? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We are slowly training into a communist country. If we dont elect someone like Ben Carson to stop it, we are doomed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Muslims never stop defending and having different opinions about a book which supposedly fell from Allah. We cannot believe whatever any immam says any more. Total chaos is what reigns anytime the truth is said about Islam. Im sad the speakers head would be chopped off if e real Muslim had his way but that cant happen in America. What a blessing for him. Im now convinced Carson is getting my vote and if he doesnt become president Ill relocate to Canada. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson should be disqualified for not respecting and defending the U.S. Constitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is one shrewd politician. Thats why he will get the GOP nomination. The only thing that the nonpoliticians Trump, Fiorina and Carson will get is a free ticket to Losertown <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Harris Zaffar, your community of ahmadiyya muslims has been persecuted by mainstream muslims all over the globe... u should stand with dr carson!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson did not back down, and he is right. Anyone who believes that Mhmd was the perfect example of a man does not belong in this country. Bring up the Holy Land Foundation Trials, CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is cool. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Like the Jewish leaders back in the day,, the media doesnt give a damn what Ben Carson can bring to the table never mind about America and its woes they just want to see a good man get destroyed. I want Ben Carson to stand his ground, but if he fumbles, Its ok, hes only human. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson is out of context. He is a doctor, not a politician. He does have a good handle on lying, but thats it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Doc Carson 2016!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson says some of the craziest stuff at times but what else do you expect from Republicans, but hes calm and likable as a person. Trump is the biggest troll in the world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

HPLucent are ancient talking points in regards to Carly. Can she beat whomever the democratic nominee ends up being? Yes. The next president will be either Trump, Carly, Carson, or Cruz. No chance democrats win period dot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everybody thats attacking Ben Carson clearly is sympathetic and very supportive of sharia law which is the law that all Muslims in the this world kneel before and practice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
McClain and Trump ? Hahahaha... They all are Democrats... Republican will lose this election again just like McClain did... They all are for money and this is a strategies to defeat republicans again ... only Ben Carson is the man that can win this election <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WELL DONE Dr.Carson.. we love you... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just when I thought about voting for a black man, Carson succumbs to to the pc pantywearers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Except that Carson is an End Times Seventh Day Adventist who believes that Murica was established as a Christian theocracy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson makes so much sense. Carson for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you dont vote for Dr. Ben Carson You are A Racist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant believe this fool is trying to downplay his original comment. Trump can plead retardation for his racism, but not you Carson. SMDH. This reminds me of one of those movie moments in a kkk meeting, when every member is cheering a hate speech until his mask accidentally falls off and hes black. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well Dr Carson, you have to learn to express yourself more clearly from the getgo, UNLESS you did it on purpose knowing you would get a ton of air time. In which case you are smarter than you look, go for it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets see....republican candidates have insulted Latinos Asians, African Americans, WOMEN, Muslims... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Carson! For an educated man, he says some seriously stupid shit! He and the orangutan Trump should just join the Nazi party already. And, fuck you Ben Carson, fuck you Ben Carson, fuck you Ben Carson. You DO NOT tell me shit about anything, or what the Constitution says, or who can do what in this country! Go hack up someone elses brain you shithead! You are even lower than Trump now, and that says a lot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The journalist whom interviewed Ben Carson should be under fire. Like really, there are not enough issues to focus on, that the media has to pose hypothetical questions?. Reminds me of the deceitful and divisive brood of vipers whom plotted against Jesus..Benson Carson has many great solutions to Americas problems, but is the media interested? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is finished, for his last ditch effort to save face he might take trip to Mecca and bow down before that black stone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

FUCK LEMMONS HE IS GUTTER TRASH. MR CARSON, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. THEY ARE PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU. MUSLIMS HAVE ALREADY PROVED OVER AND OVER, THEY ARE THE KILLERS.

Carson didnt say a muslim cant be President he said it depends on the history and the proven values to support and defend the US Constitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This segment is poorly editedcut. From the title I would think this guy was outraged over Carsons remarks. Well into it I read he is Carsons campaign manager. Very confusing. If this is a plot to get me to watch the entire Don Lemon program, it is pretty good. Not enough time always, but I do love Don Lemon a real gentleman and very well informed and fair. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is defending Carson, Whohoo! The ban against religious tests does not mean voters cannot seek to find out about, or reporters cannot try to report about, what candidates believe not just governmental policies, but everyday events, morals, etc. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The socalled Christians that commit heinous crimes, are not really Christian. Is that so hard to figure out? And why does CNN have to have this broken down for them? Islam is the most fd up religion there is!! 911 was not proof enough? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Muslims are such pussies <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What Ben Carson meant is clear, equality between sexes tolerance of other religions ironically no barbaric torture and punishment all those things are commonplace in every Muslim country in the world, and its written in their Holy Book. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson...oh yeah the guy who is a candidate because he knows what happens after you die. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson would be a great president because he is not afraid of telling the truth the principles of islam are inconsistent with the American constitution. Islam implies denying of freedom and denying of equality. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HE didnt say that a Muslim couldnt or shouldnt run. He said he would not support a Muslim running for President. But many Muslims and many bleeding heart politically correct little morons want everyone to believe that Carson said that it was unconstitutional to do so. HE NEVER SAID THAT. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Do you believe Islam is compatible with the constitution? Dr. Ben Carson... No I do not. He gave an extremely honest answer. I would not advocate... followed by good reasons and exceptions. He did not say a muslim couldnt be president or that he would barr one from the White House. Its called free speech and its in the constitution. Deal with it lame stream media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
After watching this video ,I can say without a doubt that Dr Ben Carson has my vote!He is so inspiringCarson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
America is one terrorist attack away from an all out outrage at Islam that would completely change the tone of this pointless argument. I believe its going to happen, when it does all these people shitting on Carson and Trump will fade into the woodwork. If you go back to the weeks, no years right after 911 guys like Trump and Carson would have been considered heroes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Conservatives will claim CNN is trying to divide and conquer with mind control manipulation. In reality, CNN is simply reporting on the insane comments that come out of Republicans mouths. If you dont want to be associated with bigotry, then reconsider your extreme rightwing stance. Simple as that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson just got a lot of votes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump needs to slightly blast her. She would be a great SoS or VP to have with him. I understand why he has to slightly take her down though he still needs to keep #1 cause he is the boldest of the Nons. NonPoliticians 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why are Muslims complaining about Ben Carsons comments? Muslims are the biggest hypocrites and crybabies. Christians and other nonMuslims are not allowed to hold high positions in the government or military of Muslim countries. We dont see Christians protesting in Muslim countries or they would be imprisoned and killed by Muslims. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder if a layman could get an article published in a medical journal. I want to write about Ben Carson. His would be the first documented case of Tea Party echolalia. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BEN CARSON YOU ISLAMAPHOBIC TWAT DROP OUT OF THE RACE! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Would you accept any white to say he doesnt want a black to be a president based on some of the stereotypes like we are lazy? Carson forgot the story of his own race, he forgot he could not dream to be president 50 or more years ago. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Which is very weird for you to say Dr. Carson, because just 10 years ago republicans would say the same thing about having an African American president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is just saying what right wing white Christian Americans want to hear. Theyre always looking for someone to point their fingers at so they can say look,thats the bad guy right there. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is anti american in my opinion if he dosent even understand the basics of our constitution. #FreedomOfReligion <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson said that he would not advocate putting a Muslim in charge, absolutely. That means more than just not voting for a Muslim. By definition, advocating is a strong and legal term and means that he would fight to make everyone else hold the same position, including in a court of law. That is in violation of the Constitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
pffff! Theres NO WAY Dr. Carson is going to drop out of the presidential race. Dr. Carson does not give a fuck what CAIR thinks. Theyre muslims. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You know why Ben Carson has so much free time from being a brain surgeon because no one uses their brain anymore. Its illegal to think for yourself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ill vote for Carson just cuz these muslim fucks dont like him. Go back to Syria if you dont like here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CAIR is a bunch of feckless morons....Ben Carson enjoys the same right to freedom of expression as anyone else. Again CNN is just trying to tear this man apart. We have a right to speak the truth about what the end of the world death cult islam is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Political posturing at its finest... Dr. Carson making it perfectly clear that he himself is not a Muslim so as not to lose votes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wanna hear a joke? America criticize Ben Carson for this comment, but if there were a Muslim presidential candidate, they wouldnt ever vote for him because he is Muslim. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

what the hell is this dude is talking abt..Funny how some people like what carson said..I wonder what they would think if one day carson says a Jew should not be President of America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Ben Carson was trying to say that the United States President should be a Christian President and not a Muslim President though a Muslim can run for President of the United States if he wishes too but the people in the United States would most likely vote for the Christian man running for President instead of the Muslim man because the United States is a Christian nation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Islam is a theocracy and not a religion, and Ben Carson didnt say a Muslim couldnt be a president, he said he wouldnt vote for one to be president. Shame on the Media for allowing this to be twisted, this only shows that the Media cant be trusted with the truth as they dont know what it is anymore. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

One thing is true Islam clashes with 18th century enlightenment values much more than any other religion. Women rights, rights of religious minorities, separation of church and state. When will the Left understand that these things are severely constrained under a literal reading of the Koran, which is what a sizable and growing minority of Muslims follow? Christians are not even allowed in the cities of Mecca and Medina. Anybody who agrees with that is a bigot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Scripted DIVIDE and CONQUER Psychological Manipulation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben uncle tom Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary is more likely to win than an openly muslim candidate, of course everybody knows this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its funny because the republicans call Ben Carson a nigger behind his back <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson would not support a liberal or Socialist or a Communist , so what? I wouldnt eitherCarson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WHAT? Ben Carson, really? We already elected a Muslim President. TWICE. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who the fuck is Ben Carson? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
title is about ben carson , video is 80% trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Funny thing is that neither Trump nor Carson will represent the Republicans when the presidential race starts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I do not advocate voting for Ben Carson, who is no more than a republican facsimile of Clarence Thomas. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THE GOP CLOWN CAR HAS CURRENTLY LOST The Gay Vote The Black Vote The Latino Vote The Atheist Vote The Muslim Vote The Feminist Vote The Moderate Vote The Progressive Vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The USA should be a Muslim free zone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look at the likes. SMH. Amazing seriously. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Michael Monahan This is newsworthy because Carson is number 2 in the polls for the Republican primary and hes a proud Islamophobe. This just further proves how far off the rails the GOP has gone. This aint your daddys Republican party were not even dealing with a legitimate conservative party anymore. The GOP has proven itself to be an extreme rightwing fascist party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Islamism is not conducive to the constitution. Freedom of religion Kill apostates, kill homosexuals Freedom of speech Kill those who oppose or depect Muhamed Freedom against slavery Take slaves Freedom against cruel unusual punishment behead theives. Right to the pursuit of happiness pedophilia. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone American who converts to Islam is a traitor and should be treated as such. Islam is in direct opposition to the American way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn.. CNN still trying!!... Man theyre so bought off!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson said there should not be a Muslim president and said the islamic faith is inconsistent with the constitution. Worse than what Trump didnt say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow Ben Carson is a moron <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He should worry about Sanders, not Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the only sane man on the stage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz wont criticize Trump because he wants his voters once Trump drops out <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump GOT my vote for saying this! The PROOF is out there and Trump is RIGHT! Carson is Lying! Definitely WONT Vote for Carlson Now! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson I think youre awesome, but no hes not going anywhere. Actually hes meeting with Putin next week. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why hes speaking on cnn is beyond me. This ass wipe reporter is acting like hes clueless as to what Dr. Carson is saying. Dr. carson dou yourself a favor and speak on FOX news!! Fuck CNN and liberal democrats <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I looked at her face while Dr. Carson was speaking, and could almost hear a bag of Pop Rocks exploding in her brain. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Listen to this wise man. Wisdom is needed on this day and age . America and the world needs Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One thing I know this interview actually made CNN look bad and Ben Carson look good. Carson for President!!! With Rubio, Cruz or Fiorina as a running mate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Against abortion Against welfarewelfare babies And these Republican fools continue to call themselves pro life. Things just dont compute with them, man. Not even with Ben Carson, a doctor ffs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson rise comes from Bush losing everything <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Excellent answers from Cruz and Santorum <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I got autism from listening to these idiots debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz is a sensible guy. I like him. Trump 2016 !!! TrumpCarson? TrumpCruz? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I can only imagine where Ben Carson gets his donations from. Not from Mothers and Dads, because they dont make vaccines. If I would have known, what I know now, my daughter would not have received vaccinations in the US, and overall much less, and sure none with metals in it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sorry to break this to you but Ben Carson absolutely needs to be president and bring CHRIST back to our nation. We are a CHRISTIAN nation, and we need to bring the values of JESUS back to our government!!! AMEN!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Evangelical Vote goes to Ben Carson I know this because I am an Evangelical <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and that all Im saying. Well, Carson just said it for ya, so you probably should have said it right the first time. GO CARSON!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Gupta really didnt disagree with Carson. In fact. he acknowledge that Carson was right and didnt agree with Trump starting @ 217 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what a fucking idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Tbh, Trump should be president with Carson as his vice president and Fiorina as Secretary of State, and im Hispanic <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dangerous idiocy from Trump and spineless bootlicking from Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Gupta you are a lying ass. Guess big pharma is giving you some financial kick backs to lie about Autism and vaccines. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Gupta, ben Carson did not affirm the myth that there is any link between autism and vaccinations. Also, the argument that some make regarding spreading out the vaccine schedule is a matter of months not years. Its a precautionary approach that does not yield the risks you intimated. Frankly you bit to hard on Wolfs bait. Way to make news CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So this is the first black man Democrats DONT want in the White House?? Isnt that a coincidence!! lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is the word socialist a bad word? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

So shes a feminist now? What a joke, TrumpCarson 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Arent vaccination requirements determined by States? not the federal government? Who is Ben Carson saying is Big Government? is he opposed to states setting their own vaccination rules? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson, no. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
COME ON BERNIE WIN BABY WIN! my message to all the other presidential candidates, with all due respect BERN BABY BERN! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good Candiates We Evangelicals might come out this year to vote for Carson, Carly, Rubio or even Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah, keep Crispy Cream in Jersey. Guy cant even manage his own body, why would you put him in charge of a country? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr. Trump what IS your favorite color? Trump yellow Crowd Cheers! Carson I like yellow too! high five Crowd Cheers! Jeb Bush I smoked pot once laughter <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Being totally uneducated about this, I go with Carson plus Paul plus Trump over Gupta. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
they really did a number on trump i fill carson will surpass him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN has been sucking carsons dick because he is black. But now that he agreed with Trump, they are going to attack him ruthlessly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has just proven himself to be a shill for the pharmaceutical companies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There has been scientific research that proves that you are born gay. Ben Carson is completely wrong. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Just having sex with a member of the same sex doesnt make you gay. Plenty of str8 people experiment with sex, but that doesnt change their sexuality. Being gay means you are attracted to the same sex. There is a difference. So the implication Carson makes is that a str8 person goes into jail and, perhaps, engages in sexual activity to pass the time or whatever makes them gay is false. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is right about those poisons vaccinations. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson seems retarded <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson looks great for 63. Black people age so well <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson should professionally be reading bed time stories. Most boring voice ever <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson looks like the Valet parking attendant at Trump Towers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Vaccines are responsible for murdering a genetic race of people who are highly responsive to poisons. There are secret courts that only deal with vaccination injuries. These courts pay out millions to the children that werent killed but the walking wounded of vaccines. Go to hell Dr Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Chris Christie gets called fat all the time and no one defends him. Many of the candidates get attacked for their looks, especially trump with his hair. Why should they defend Fiorina? Because shes a women? If so then dont say youre for equal rights, because youre giving special privilege to her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I want trump or carson to win <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump lost my vote by saying this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders better win. Come on America, please! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When that useless shitbag Huckabee first said that, everyone thought he was talking about Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson looks like he needs a nap!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson doesnt really seem like he has much drive, like he explains himself well, but he comes off as rather timid and not really like a leader. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Did Trump tap Carsons elbow like he would have patted a beauty queens behind before the days of politically correct sexual harassment ethics? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God I love Bernie, he genuinely seems like the only real choice <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not sure why Trump decided to fire the first salvo at Rand Paul. Trump is a douche, but smart. Maybe Trump thinks that Rand is a dark horse that will give him problems in the future. One thing is for sure. Rand seems to be the best candidate. If Carson grew a spine, he would be a candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
where is the CERTIFICATE that says ben carson does NOT have autism!? HUH!? why is he HIDING it?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
when trump attacked fiorina he attacked her not all women. if it does mean that he is attacking all women then it also means that if he attacks carson he is attacking all african americans. Trump is not attacking women he is attacking Carly. this isnt an issue of sexist its an issue of carly not looking presidential. Also, does she ever move her eyebrows. its kinda creepy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Of all candidates on both sides of the political Field. Bernie is by far the ONLY cerebral intellectual one aside from Ben Carson Rand Paul. Bernie 2016, sorry Hilary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is the only reasonable one on the stage. Fuck Rubio, Fuck Bush, Fuck Chris Christie, and Trump is a FOOL!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So saying a bad thing about one woman candidate means that he said a bad thing about the entire female population. Fuck me, can liberals really be THAT stupid to believe it? Scrolls down the comments Yes, they can! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON IS A LIAR. Vaccines cause Autism, plenty of proof of that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why the fuck do all the repubs need to be barbaric pious morons? Im a libertarian, but Bernie seems to be the only reasonable choice this term. goddamn I hate this country. also why the hell isnt discussion of the national debt more prominent? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TrumpCarson might be a possibility they got along pretty good and the Dr. even backed up Trumps idea of giving the vaccines in increments. The moderator was trying to spin Trumps words around as saying he was one the antivaccine people.......WRONG!! haha <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carly looked angry and sour the entire night. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a hack if he doesnt know that #vaccines cause #autism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson took his milk money and ate his lunch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FEEL THE BERRRNNN...... GO BERNIE SANDERS!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only Viable candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump pwned Carsen. But every American should be dead against forced, government mandated vaccinations. It should be up to the individual and the parents. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so who do you think was the winner? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson needs to just drop out and announce his vice presidency with Donald Trumps campaign. it would be an autowin. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trump carson and cruz have a little bromance going on <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Beautiful face my ass. Enough with the PC garbage. Trump Gets my Vote. Liberals can blow me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is a video I would expect some random youtuber to put out not CNN itself. Craving those views CNN? Putting out as much drama filled shit as possible to get them? Go fuck yourself, and the rest of big media bullshit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I wonder how much trump pay for this. they are trying so hard to make him look electable. by the way those 120 minutes was all he said on the debate, he didnt talk about anything but add hominem and bull shit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
PROLIFERS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!! I believe with all my heart that Donald Trump and Ben Carson are really prochoice because I heard both of them say they are for research and vaccines. The majority of the vaccines used today have DNA from aborted babies in them. So, that makes it so you have to keep abortion going. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She cant run any of my companies LMAO..Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id like to see a TrumpCarson team. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trumps BEST ZiNGER was when he said that he had never criticized how Rand Paul LOOKED but there was a lot of SUBJECT MATTER there. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson called CNN irresponsible to their face and they still didnt get it. #KNOWINGISHALFTHEBATTLE #CNNSUCKS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
MORE ENERGY tonight I LIKE that! LMAO! Best line of the debate. Trump is simply the best entertainer there is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN had a SCREENED audience. An audiences hand picked to favor both establishment candidates and in particular Fiorina! Thats what happens when your network of associates own and operate 95% of the WORLDS media! Fiorina now has the backing of the ESTABLISHMENT! Rove and all of the NeoCons are playing her up because they know Jeb and the rest of their bought and paid for establishment shills, are toast! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its a good thing shes not a doctor...if she loses her shit like this every time she sees something gross, what do you think shell do as President? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes the only one who wont be bought <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has the gift to make the American people believe in American again. He makes me feel as good about America as Ronald Reagan did. Listen to him for yourself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nobody all night mentioned Bernie Sanders? I take it too that there is nothing that thay can say bad about him.I hope he is the nominee,all that talk about Hillary goes for nothing.Nobody still giving Bernie a chance? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, what an impassioned clarion call for the protection of innocent human life! Its criminal that Planned Parenthood is receiving 500 MILLION of federal taxpayer . How many women become parents by going to Planned Parenthood? The answer is NOT MANY! Planned Parenthood performs 330,000 abortions per year. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
roflololol to me it doesnt sound like a complex statement at all Drop the mic... not to hard though it might scare her because she would be confused by what made the sound. I wonder how she got paid to talk when she gets so confused when people make word sounds at her. Go Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dear America, if this man becomes your president the world will never take you seriously again. Hes a fucking caricature <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is a despicable human being. Id take Rand Paul, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush although I detest the whole damn family sorry Jeb, Carly Fiorina, and Chris Christie well before Donald Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WE LOVE DR. DONALD TRUMP!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My vote is for Bush 2016 Trump is a sneaky little Snake <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand was the best debater up there tonight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Any potential side effects of vaccines are barely even worth mentioning. Vaccines have completely eradicated whole diseases. Yes, you should have the freedom to spread out vaccinations, but it should not be a debate whether or not they should be administered. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is the only rational person on that stage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP LOST THE DEBATE. He ended looking like a demagogue and an airhead at the same time. By the way, how can a ludopathy spreader become a presidential candidate? lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand knowledgeable, does homework, applied common sense, thinks and reasons Trump bombast and some more bombast <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is an idiot and so is Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is naive <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON is ok, i have a better opinion of him after this debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul gained my respect for this! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im sorry I didnt catch that last part. Did he really just say George Bush, GEORGE BUSH was a strong leader in 2001? Its funny how republicans just LOVE George Bushs decision of going to war but when confronted with facts about how we invaded the wrong country or how many american soldiers were killed, theyll simply brush it off and say oh yeah, it the Democrats fault. Barack Obama is was a terrible president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rogues gallery full of power craving lying cunts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh shut up Donald we all know youre lying you know what you meant and cant deny it and that red face of yours at the end cant either <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is the only one who speaking any kind of sense and fucking jack always cutting him off. Trump and that woman and bush are a joke cant even take them seriously. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well Liberal whites are racists. Liberals and Democrats were the ones who owned slaves. They also belittle all races based on color of skin, AKA not racial equality. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Being gay is not a choice. I cant just choose to develop feelings for men, if the equation was flipped. But I do feel as though, something has to happen in your life to make you that way, something at a VERY young age. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is great because he doesnt see color and tells it like it is, guys very intelligent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I WOULD LIKE DR CARSON TO TAKE LOOK AT TRUMP BRAIN.SOMTHING IS WRONG WITH THIS MAN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson nice guy but hes a doctor, doctor, doctor! We dont need a doctor. We need a builder a wheeler dealer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

That officer was being paranoid, nobody can draw their weapon faster than i can level and fire mine in a situation like that. Police need to quit acting like theyre in a military combat zone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is such a joke lol he doesnt know anything about politics or government he is way out of his league <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is garbage. Ben Carson simply said that he has been more open about his faith than Trump. Anyone with two eyeballs and a brain could see this is true. Trump is childish here in how irate he is. I mean, really? I think Trump is feeling threatened by Ben Carson because Carson is advancing in the polls without trying to make a fool of everyone else and hogging the media with his ridiculous statements. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a doctor I admire SO much Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson at it again. SO good!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
it is a complex statement for a stupid ass, blond headed, bimbo such as this woman to understand. so carson has to speak to her like a mentally challenged person again slowly for her to finally understand what he meant by those comments. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hurray for Ben Carson! I would do anything to have that man as president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this guys the next president. finally some hope for this country. if Bernie or hillary wins and not this guy, say bye to amedica. were done. Ben Carson is our salvation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HOW COULD SOMEONE SO SMART SAY SOMETHING SO STUPID????? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson doesnt even address his audience when he gives a speech. There is no way this guy can be president. Kanye West gives better speeches than Carson lmfao <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson says he is against stem cell research...But OOO when he is paid he will break his moral rules and do stem cell research. I DONT WANT ANOTHER SELL OUT AS MY PRESIDENT!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is better <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ben Carson, but he has to beat my candidate Ted Cruz. I he is the main guy on the ballot the yeah. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Before anybody says anything, what if you were the officer? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson didnt even attack Trump why is Trump attacking him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson is losing TRUMP IN 16 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson had a good solution to the abortion issue. He said just change the name from fetuses to tweezoids, after all, how many people could get all enthused about any save the tweezoids campaign? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson, the only person to do a frontal lobotomy left handed and blindfolded, while eating a Big Mac. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, if you ever considered voting for Sarah Palin, at least Ben Carson is a step up. Nice guy, but his nice guy philosophizing is not quite good enough qualifications to be president. Oh the other hand, looking at the rest of the clowns in the Republican nominee race, yeah, go ahead vote for Ben. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The right is nuts in general, though Carson does seems much more normal and intelligent than Trump is, but then who doesnt. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bible says, you shall be judge by your words ! Anyone carefully hear Ben and Trump, they will know that Ben Carson is the true man of his words. He speaks very carefully and not just blah blah blah <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
an OK doctor???? Dr Carson is one of the top, if not THE top, neurosurgeons on earth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for President 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson, please address the issue of free market economy, that resulted in deregulating business, banking, housing, etc.,even the media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
she isnt a pretty women in any senc of the word and have you listen to Carson there is no enthusiasm to him whatsoever its like as if just woke up or hes telling a kids bedtime story <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Chris, Ben Carson is a nice guy. Problem is people are finding out he advocates MANDATORY VACCINES. Women are not happy. Their kids are their concern. Watch videos of the NEW polio vaccine that is being used in Africa and India. Paralyzed kids and the rest dying. 47% increase in polio. Research this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes misusing Michaels name for his candidacy. If he was such a good friend of Michael, where was he in 2004 ? If you want real arguments for America instead of namedropping, vote for Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you dont know how to eat pussy. You just learned. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is part of the seventh day Adventist cult. Ellen g white is a false prophet <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wouldnt be surprised if Trump feels threatened by the success of Dr, Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is no Christian, and Carson is a member of the antichrist cult 7th Day Adventist. Carson believes the Christians who worship on Sunday instead of keeping the Sabbath are going to hell. Neither deserve to be president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
you know who needs a numerologist? Ben Carson and Dip Shit Trump.. They both have mental problems <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
now he doubts Ben Carson is born.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Looks more like Bobby Jindals few remaining bigmoney donors are about to pull out over his poll numbers being so low. Jindal has nothing left to lose. Might as well attack a fellow Republican, one who signed a dopey pledge to support stupid politicians like Jindal. Bbye, Bobby! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
10 Trumps can work for Ben Carson ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson 2016!! Trump just really sunk with me... come on haters <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im an issues guy. Go to berniesanders.comissues Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Hillary, etc. also have web pages that describe what they feel the important issues are. So far Im with Bernie. He wants to end NAFTA, stop the TPP, stop big banks from gambling with our money, stop trading in derivatives, increase social security, bring that 2.5 trillion dollars home from large corporations who are hiding the money to avoid taxes. Geeze there is so much common sense stuff coming from Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We like Carson Donald. Are you, well... Mad? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trumps not half the man ben carson is <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson seems gentle to a point of being absurd. Hes intentionally passive and subtle and sneaky about what he says and does. Theres alot more to him than he lets on. I dont know what it is. Hes very... gentle. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the man, fuck trump!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a cocky little cunt <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I Trust Donald Trump only a fool would trust Carson more than Trump idc how good of a fucking Doctor he is we are talking about running The Fucking Country here! Not Surgery for godsake! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
these idiots are there to judge a man of such intelligence as Dr. Ben Carson. Amazing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson performs surgery on his own brain. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson, you fucked with the wrong candidate...you should have left it alone dude. Watch that white cracker vote in Iowa disappear now. People gave you a sympathy vote just waiting for you to take the Trump bate, now thats happened so long and see you at the kids table come Thanksgiving. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OHHHHHH SNAP! DR. CARSON BURNED HIM!!! That dude with the glasses probably went home and completely reevaluated his life. Bahahahahahaha! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump the Chump. Ben Carson 2016 vs Bernie Sanders 2016. Also, Capitalism dying in the late 1980s and died in 2010. Corporatism has taken over. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and Carson are the best candidates they should not engage into this war of words. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump can talk to China, Russia and Europe much better than Carson. Carson knows medicine but not dealing with world leaders. Trump is a natural at making deals. Screw Oreo, Ford, Chevy HP and Apple and ..... for exporting jobs. We should really start exporting the unemployed if all we want are nice talking heads, we need deal makers! Keep American jobs in America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump Is a joke! Ben Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For the most part I have mad respect for Dr. Carson. But this is one of the dumbest things I ever heard him say. It is one thing if for what ever reason you dont believe in gay marriage, but it is a fact that being gay isnt a choice. You cant choose who you are sexually attracted to. And you would think Dr. Carson, a man of science and one of the best neurosurgeon in the world, would know that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump, what a baby, ben carson is grinding you down in the battle of words, shouting back at him does more harm to you than it does to him. Go Ben Go! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson wants mandatory vaccines for everyone, adults and children. Anyone who would vote for any of these clowns, is not paying attention. Besides, if voting worked they wouldnt use it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson was an excellent doctor! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh Man in Vegas the odds are high as to when Trump is going to unleash the Michael Richard Move on Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump can suck it. BEN CARSON ALL THE WAY 2016!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everytime I look at Jundal I always think Hello, welcome to 7Eleven, my name is Jindal. How can I help you? He belongs NOWHERE near the White House! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I feel like he must that up but nobody can correct him <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>
Does Carson even know what Republican values stand for?!?! I think he is in the wrong political party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
022...Trump...regarding Dr. Carson hes very low key........Cuomo Strong words...seriously! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As usual, Mr. Carson handles himself professionally as he intelligently answers questions by Don. As a reporter, I felt Don couldve asked more mature questions on Foreign policies and Immigration issues instead of trying to get Carson to sweat over his stand for the 2nd Amendment. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
....a much more relevant and probing question for The pious Dr. Carson... How do you Dr. Carson, a strict no work 7th day Saturday Sabbathtarian Sectarian balance your religious convictions with the Presidency an intense 247 Job ?...oh and as a follow up...does your denomination stll believe that the Pope is the Beast that meat eating is a sign of general impiety and last but not least that Sunday worship is the mark of the beast ?..?..? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN dont waste time on this loser because his own state wants him out of office <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That dude Carson should go back to separating twins and read his bible go ahead say some stupid u bunch of haters <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has the energy of jeb bush. Both make me fall asleep. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson sucks trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Perhaps Mr. Trump hasnt watched much news, but over the years, Ive read about and seen on the news the various surgeries that Dr. Carson has performed. I know a lot of doctors, but very few of the ones that I know of actually have articles written about their daily grind. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has been very prolife for decades. Trump is the one who was pro lateterm abortion only a few years ago. Trump has some good ideas, but seriously, come on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jindals a phenomenal anchor baby Jeb is a Bush Carson is a hypocrite Trump is the best dam autistic retard self centered crop top in the world. None of them matter if majority of the country are liberals. Enjoy playing the race within your racist bubble for now, your just good tv. Very entertaining. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has only had faith for 45 years? what kind of claim is that? he has books talking of his long held faith dating over 30 years. even then, as a mild mannered, welleducated doctor who had no true benefit from obscuring his history, stated his faith goes back to his youth <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This Donald Trump guy is always bickering about other republican running mates. Hes really attacking the wrong guy this time. I cant wait for the next debate so Carson and wash him off and put an end to his kinder garden fantasy politics. Donald trump calls Carson a simple doctor with a nurse. Now you know hes an idiot that most be stopped. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Viva Trump! ! Jindal run for president of CVS, Carly buys botox stock and was kicked out of HP by poor to disastrous performance, Carson is a wonder of naivete in foreign affairs, PUTIN would laugh while spitting out vodka at Carsons mention. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is ABSOLUTELY correct about Donald Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In a past interview Trump said dont bring up his past, but hes bringing up Carsons past information lol hypocrite! You wont be the next president either, Mr. Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why..... why in the heck would ANY ONE vote for Donald Trump? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Donald Trump is a man of faith, I must have misread the bible. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson 2016, I don t trust Donald, I like him but no Trust. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jindall now officially killed his own campaign, not that it was hard to do with less then 1% in the polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont be ThinSkin, Dr. Carson. Suck it up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump for 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson does seem a bit slow. Could be early onset Alzheiners. I hope not. Trump looks strong like a leader should. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Ben Carson should apologize for attempting to become the leader of an evil, wicked nation hell bent on destroying his people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson seems a little slow like an autistic adult. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Isnt it funny how the media is attracted to Donald Trump like flies on shit. What is the real meaning of Trump maybe its turd because flies flock to shit! lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is Carson even running to be president? As a fanatical SeventhDay Adventist, he presumably believes that the return of Jesus is i.e., any day now, so what sort of longterm planning would this delusional nincompoop have for the economy or anything else? It beyond ridiculous. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump said on Sept 3rd that doctors dont create jobs. So, what do you call that? An attack or not? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a tremendous individual. How can someone attack him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump couldnt have answered that last question any better. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I support Ben Carson, I actually put him first place, before Trump entered the race. Because I think Trump has more to offer than Carson. But I think its kind of lame, that someone from Ben Carsons party wants to settle things with an apology. I dont hope this is Bens stance or I will lose faith in him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What goes around comes around. Carson insults Trump first then demands an apology? Gtf outta here with that bullshit. Carson is obviously weak sensitive like the country needs more of that right now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a brilliant surgeon. President not so much!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE AND NO CARSON DID ATTACK FIRST TRUMP DID <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump beats everyone head to head including the proven liar Hillary. Trump will be at 50% by the end of the year, Carson will be nowhere and Hillary will be hoping she isnt indicted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson attacked first moron, and why isnt carson speaking? hed rather have this guy speak for him, what a pathetic weakass <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why people believe a doctor can run a country? what does he know about economy about foreign affairs about negotiations? nothing! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump doesnt believe in affirmative action, sorry! No special treatment. He didnt apologize to any of the other candidates he trashed so ill bet he wont apologize to Carson either. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why should Trump treat Carson any differently than he does the other candidates? Trump isnt going to apologize lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump dont be a hypocrite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I used to like Trump, until this interview. Childish. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Trump is so sure about being the next president, then why is he so worried about Carson? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is ruining his chance to be his VP. TRUMPALLEN WEST 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
His tactic is to personally insult people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
See how Trump doesnt take a breath. He bullies the interviewer! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
while a brilliant doctor, exactly what experience does carson have at managing large organizations? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its true look at that ugly face. Who would vote for that? The Donald speaking the truth once again. Fuck you PC Fag Cuomo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson Trump, actually almost anyone in the GOP Trump All he does is insulting people, I wouldnt vote for him in a million years. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They should put ther differences aside and run as a Team Trump Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump screwed up. Should not have said that, it was wrong. Apologize and move on. Damn. I want to be able to vote for this guy, but the more words that come out his mouth, the more I cringe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a idiot everyone here in Canada HATES him ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is the first time Trump has REALLY looked desperate. An OK doctor what a laugh. If Donald thinks he is going to have a contest with Ben on the Bible. Trump will be looking Bankrupt...again! I would pay real money to here that debate <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is right.Never attack unless attacked, never provoke unless provoked. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bravo! TRUMP! Donald, This Cuomo commie whos family has more skeletons than a coney island freak show doesnt deserve an interview with you. The only Carson I know is Johnny. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i like Carson but i just want to ruffle him up a bit because he does not energize people..and he cant do anything about it because hes just that way ...but no way we will loose with TrumpCruz ticket lets do this <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And here I was thinking that Trump was a failed bit of brain surgery by Carson, guess I was wrong <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Biden, Clinton , sanders no , no, no ..... Carson or trump 2016 , horrible lineup of democratic clowns <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

But I dont know if I believe any politician is a true Christian. Only God truly knows <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump kindergarten politics. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not sure why... But I like them both Carson and trump should run together a doctor and a business man , thats a good blend ..... Plus black and white . Health and wealth wow that sound like freedom <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson speaks softly, but his words are really really out there like prisons being gay factories? like wtf? Has Trump made his views known about gay marriage? As a New Yorker Id expect hes much more tolerant? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Liberals are racist what have they done for the African American community nothing,Look at Chicago Obamas stomping ground they really dislike him these are people who believed the lie of Obama of hope and change.

I love Dr.Carson a lot. Whatever other might say, it would not matter, I would vote for him without hesitation But let me ask this, is any candidate on both parties,people would not critisize? NONE. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the dumbest smart person I have sever seen. He says some of the most stupid things I have ever heard, even for a conservative. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a winner. Trump change his tune by signing that puke pledge to the Rinos. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Where does the Republicant party get these crazy bozos. Obama care worse since slavery? Really Carson. What an uncle Tom. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carsons policies are very stock in trade. if it was that easy, it would have already been done. he should stick to medicine. overly cerebral, and no track record of achievement in government. he is the barack obama of the GOP. sounds good, not substantive. USA can ill afford another four years of an ineffective administration. carson does not respect the office of the POTUS, so why should the electorate respect a sloganeering neurosurgeon? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Actually, slavery was the best thing to have happened to us africanamericans... Ben Carson I cant imagine how much it hurts being that stupid <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN has been biased against Ben Carson since the jump. Trying to paint him as homophobic when all of the republican candidates hold the same views of gays. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This was supposed to be a video about Carson and all they do is talk about Trump and Bush?!? WTF CNN? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

history shows that the worst heads of state were doctors and doctors always make worst statemen. This Ben Carson has the potentials to become a worse president. he seems to lecturing people and has sharp positions on issues that should be compelling him to apply serious nuance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson says 86% of our border is not under our control! Reporters like.... wait a sec Dr Carson, lemme ask you a question you already answered twice..... I dont waste my time supporting the media. I get my political information from watching youtube videos of the actual candidates speaking about their policies and beliefsvalues. The media is awful. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This dude is makin Dr Carsons point over and over again... Hes answering the question, and the guy is repeating his answers INTENTIONALLY incorrectly!?! Totally ridiculous! Kudos to Dr Carson for standing up against the bias National media, and these so calledjournalists! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im amazed at how many people dismiss Dr Carson because they find him boring. This is not a reality tv show. This is the U.S. Presidential race and the point is not at all to be entertaining. This is why a jackass like Trump has momentum people want to be entertained and dont give two fucks about the quality of leaders we have. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TRUMP and Carson What a TICKET BAMA <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is right. Plain and simple. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If donald trump becomes president Im going to canada but if kanye west becomes president i gonna kill that nigga If another bush take over the White House Im going to kill myself and if al gore runs Im going to kill Matt Groening But if either ben Carson or Hillary Clinton wins is a sure thing for our beloved american history but that just me But the conclusion Stick to rap music, Kanye and eat a dick, Donald Trump you greed breathing motherfucker <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I also bet that Dr Carson also could not field those questions,, Trump and Carson are not 100% in the know about that mess in the middle east ,,,, But ,, can you tell me what the career politicians are doing about the situation ?? they are a complete JOKE!! Obama and Clinton are playing us American people ,,, so CNN wants to make Trump look bad ,,, we are not buying your Media BS ,,,, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As much as people tried, and failed in overlooking trump, to over look Dr. Carson who is quietly going about the business of politics is impressive. It just shows that two diametrically opposed personalities can be effective in different ways. Ignore Dr. Carson at your own peril. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson can solve complex issues and he has intelligence that any of the candidate can only dream of especially trump. Trump maybe good at doing deals but so is Carson. It will be my first time voting because I always thought there was no point but Carson has changed that for me and my two brothers <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will vote for some who has a skill set that is harder to learn than the names of the leaders of terrorist organizations .... somebody who I feel can lead, negotiate, and get the job done .... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trump is an idiot...my god americans are stupid for having carson and trump leading the polls <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
MEDIAS ARE BUNCH OF ASSHOLES...HES TRYING TO EMBARRASS TRUMP!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I bet you anything that most of the politicians wouldnt know the answers either. I know they cant do any worse than what we have now. As none of the politicians I can think back to, have done a great job so far. I think it is time to give a non politician a chance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If I want my health checked I will call Carson... But if I want my wealth checked I will call Trump!!! This country is a business therefore we need a businessman to run it!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an amazing man. I thought that interview was debate practice, as most of the questions appeared to be aimed at his character, yet he rolled them off of his suit like RainX on a windshield. A very impressive response to gotcha journalism.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is obviously a fucking retard. Seriously, he has the brain capacity of a six year old. No ability to logic and too lazy to do any research before proudly spewing his ignorance all over the place. Hes basically Herman 2.0. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is probably the only one of them that sounds like he reads. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does Trump say hell make everything better but doesnt specify on how hell do it? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These guys dont know what the fuck theyre doing. Where the hell is a good candidate when you need one? As a conservative myself, all these guys are clueless idiots. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My God, Trump supporters are really pathetic. Hugh was more than fair to Trump but all you can do is whine about how Trump was treated unfairly simply because he didnt know the answer to a fair question.

Way to go Dr.Carson.. we want you as the next US president... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump it only about his money talk. My money, As I put my money I earned so much.. What is important to him? Presidency or his money!? People not need the money. People need to have a job, have good medical policy and other... Live here and reared children. Money will not change the world. And America and other countries, is changing the world. Ben CarsonHe knows what people want in the president. I think he is a good president for the America!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If you think Ben Carson should be the republican nominee, you might be a #cuckservative. Carsons a nice guy, but republicans who support him are PATHETIC. Dont you idiots realize how brainwashed you are by the left? Youre only supporting him to try to prove to insane antiwhite liberals that youre not racist. Newsflash MINORITIES WILL STILL VOTE DEMOCRAT IF HES THE NOMINEE. They want handouts handouts handouts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if the republicans want any chance of winning, they will choose ben carson. basically all non whites will vote democrats along with many whites <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson seems like a good man but is to weak to be in control of the military Trump? No weakness there so far just the opposite, Trumps an ass kicker intelligent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is runner up. Phooey! So much for those polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a nice guy but he is not going to be the president. Not going to happen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson rocks I might register to vote just to vote for him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson would be the best thing for America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im shocked at how well Carson is doing. I like him, and I think hes going to continue to do well, especially given the competition. I dont think hell do well enough to get the nomination, tho. And if its a Trump ticket, Carson cant be on it. It would be too little political experience going into the general. Theyd get trounced. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a sensible person. Kind and nice and not screaming and yelling WHO CAN NEVER GET THE JOB DONE. Trump 2016 !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

nice try CNN, but Ben Carson is just as bad as Trump, only he lives in Koch pockets. Did you try apathy towards the both of them? I hear Bernie Sanders is beating the both of them if you wanted to do a real news report someday. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im voting for Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson proves that expertise in one field doesnt necessarily translate to competence in another. Separating Siamese twins has nothing at all to do with running a country, but management of a financial empire clearly does. Better a capitalist than a surgeon in the White House. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Interesting how this media channel is taking their comments out of context. Trying to shape the reason why Trump and Carson are doing so well pretty dishonest but at CNN for ya. Thats why their ratings are in the tube. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Two things Trump and Carson have in common that no other candidate running. theyre not career politicians. Americans on republic in side of spectrum are sick and tired of career politicians lies <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I cant take another 4 years of the race card, even if its being played against the Democrats. That said, it would be fun to watch Carson drop the 88th Airborne into Baltimore, or some other crimeridden, Demled riot zone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>
Carson doesnt have a chance in hell. If trump is risky then what is Carson ? He would be a wild card that has no experience with anything that would benefit Washington. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson could become the first African American president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It makes sense if the republicans pick Ben Carson...Black people will vote for him because hes black. Thats how they are. Carson is still an idiot though. Obama care is worst then Pearl harbor, 911, Sandy Hook,....republicans are idiots <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Poll shows that only Mr Carson can beat Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wow, Jim Acosta is a moron. How many times did he badger the drone strike question? Then look at the CNN banner that says Carson use drone strikes to secure the border Group of morons. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really liked this. The interviewer was just trying to do his job but rubbed me the wrong way, Dr Carson seems very on point. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would bet that if Carson were as well known as Trump or Clinton, he would be president. Also, people think that Obama was a bad choice so they wont vote for him because hes an African American. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Anyone who votes for Bernie Sanders is a traitor to America. He is a SOCIALIST! Godammit! A SOCIALIST! Thats not Capitalism! You vote for Bernie and youre a traitor whos selling your country down the river, selling your countrys soul!! The next step after socialism is communism Wheres the red scare?! WHY ARE YOU LIBERALS ALL SO BRAINWASHED? The democrats pull you in by supporting civil rights even though Reps do, too and giving you free stuff! STOP!!! I TELL YOU, STOP!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even as a republican who will vote for Ben Carson, Bernie Sanders seems to be sensible on a lot of topics. While I dont agree with his policies on socialism, I think that his motivation for that is to help working Americans, which is good. Look up Bernie Sanders vs. Ben Carson. I would rather have Carson, but I think Sanders is by far the most sensible on the Democrat side. I respect that he understands that 99.9% of gun owners arent criminals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump can be Carsons VP, but not the other way around! Carson for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I liked the responses Ben Carson gave in this interview. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OMG, which is more pathetic CNN thinking we would believe this crock, then putting it out there. O actually recording it for release. Both of them knowing that if we were ignorant enough to put him into office, not just once, but twice did that REALLY HAPPEN??, they can throw anything at us. Like Dr Carson says the media, in a true democracy, has a sacred rolethey are singled out for protection under our constitution. Would anyone like to try to explain this to our media? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Imagine this... President Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is a clown, you really dont know where he stands on MOST issues. It takes more than a anti illegal immigration issue to win the White House. Ben Carson has lived the American Dream, truly a remarkable man. He will make a tremendous President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN you have no credibility. Ben Carson believes in gun control and had no problem using fetal tissue as a Dr. which disqualifies him for at least half the conservative vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

These are the same Iowa Republicans who loved Santorum in 2012, Huckabee in 2008, Bob Dole in 1988 and George Bush in 1980...and came real close to giving Pat Buchanan the nod in 1996. Which should tell you that theyre a collection of vacuous stooges. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Carson is right, but i want to add on. Guns are legal for sport and protection there is no arguing about that. Criminals dont care about the law to begin with and they will get guns either way because again they dont care. Taking them away will just add to the violence we saw during the prohibition and the cartels we see now in Mexico. It is unfair to the public to add violence and take away protection. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What are baseball bats made to do? What are hammers designed to do? They are TOOLS! Now, what are guns designed to do? A gun is NOT a tool! A gun is a weapon designed to kill a person or animal! I wish conservatives would stop making the comparison that tools are equivalent to firearms. Its a ridiculous attempt to defend gun fetishism in America. Dr Carson should be ashamed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Its obvious that Trump is probably the least racist Republican candidate, aside from maybe Carson. At least hes outspoken about it, and not some in the closet, racist. All of the other Republican candidates have been disrespecting and attacking President since day one, showing no class at all. Now all of a sudden what Trump said about Obama makes him a racist. GTFO LOL. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love Dr Carson and there is no doubt in my Military Mind that he would make an excellent CIC and President, but I think we need someone who is more outspoken and hard, which would be Donald Trump! I want to see a TRUMPCRUZ or a TRUMPCARSON ticket for 2016! Course, my pet miniature Pig, Allah, would do a better job as President than the Kenyan Queen, Obama, has done in seven years of failure! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN why are you trying to distort Dr. Carsons words? Are there no ethics in reporting? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a Butthole Trump is...Yes Trumps is spreading Hate n Feeding Hate to his stupid followers... LOL this guy Donald Duck is all talk... He wont last, it also show us how cowardly the GOP is of him by not attacking his Butt, if you GOPs cant handle Donald Duck, then what makes you think you can Handle Putin? Case Close, Hillary n Bernie for President...Amen.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is a mute point theyre all legal citizens and went through the process in a reasonable legal manner. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a good and decent man. Thoughtful people should give him consideration, but dont let the left or the media define him. Use your own good judgement and listen to what he says, not what people say he says. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey guys guys!!! Check this out...... If you dont support Carson for president..youre a racist. HAHAHA #Carson2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One word BULLSHIT! This guy is a fucking JOKE! How can any of you feebleminded dumbasses take this guy seriously?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What is wrong with the national media today, watch Jim Acostas performance in this interview. I am certainly no supporter of Ben Carson or his opinions, BUT Acosta behaves and questions in a sophomoric manner. Carson demonstrates patience and intelligence. Acostas manner is precisely what is wrong with the media generally. They want to be the story, create the story and make up a story rather than report on what is actually going on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN keeps trying to ake Carson look dumb but he always turns it around on them. Who watches this channel? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is nuts! Crazy coocoo in the head and its ironic that hes a brain surgeon! Any college educated person who thinks people go into jail straight and come out as gay is fucking nuts! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Truly a brilliant man, I can only wonder what eight years of Dr. Carson would have been like instead of these past seven abysmal years the American people have had to suffer under obama and his democrat regime. The GOP has such an incredible group of talented conservative candidates that it will be difficult to choose who are next president will be. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson better checks what the heck is in your brain! otherwise you need to learn English <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I cant believe how many times Jim Acosta asks the same question on Drones. I hope the public can see the biases in this interview. It looks like they want to trick Dr. Carson, but he is much smarter then his CNN questioner. Dr. Carson is direct and speaks the truth to the questions, he doesnt try and dodge any one of them. #BC2DC <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If Trump collapses, and he wont, his supporters will most definitely NOT vote for Bush, I hate to tell you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This reporter knows exactly what Carson was saying. He just wanted to trip him up so the media would have an outofcontext soundbite to play and use and against Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not voting for this dude <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is very hard NOT to have respect for Dr. Carson. He probably is the most intelligent candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
at some point i hope we have some responsible media you are talking to the wrong person, Dr Carson. the commie news network thrives on sensationalism, misquoting and outright lying. yeah, dumbass CNN. a surgeon who dedicated himself to saving lives is going to call for killing people <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This is the interview that destroyed Ben Carsons candidacy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson tryna sneak in <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not a fan of President Obama, but its not like the Republicans are any better either. Hilary is sneaky, Bernie, eh I dont know since I dont pay him any mind and frankly he is old. Rand Paul, Scott Walker, Christ, and all them others are clowns. Ben Carson is ok, but sometimes I dont know if hes having a stroke or what. I will vote for Trump before anyone else. Sometimes your most weirdestcraziest person will be the person who get things done. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Where are the Mexican and black kids <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
dont know why ben Carson is second on the poll, he pissed the rightwingers off when Ben used to study on fetual tissue, specifically studying the nose and brain areas on the brain, the fetuses he was studying were probably around 17 or 23 weeks old. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i dont see hypocrisy in Carsons statement.a foetus with a chance at life should live. that i think is the point being made here <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON WILL DO THE SAME THING THAT OBAMAS BEING DOING TO AMERICA ATTACK THE WHITE MAN IN AMERICA ATTACKING THE COPS AND FLOODING AMERICA WITH MORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SURGERY AND POLITICS DONT MIX <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I was a Rand Paul fan for several years. However, with these last few months as well as the debate. He has really turned me off. He has only been whining and throwing temper tantrums at his opponents. Same with many of the candidates. Except for Carson and Trump, theyre both pretty straight forward... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is the front runner so I dont know whats going to happen, but I think Trump, Carson, Kasich, and Fiorina are the most viable candidates for PresVP on the right. Kasich is the only career politician in that group, plus hes center right, so I think hes probably the best over all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This bernie guy, wow. When he smells BS, he catches it before it reaches him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How, in Gods name, does this woman have supporters? She lies through her teeth and politicizes EVERYTHING when it is to her advantage to do so. NO MORE CLINTONS! NO MORE BUSHS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
RAND PAUL FOR PRESIDENT <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is so amazing. He is so smart. Love him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That explains why Ben Carson is running and has a strong support from many white Republicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Notice CNN wont straight up interview the man on the subject ! lol Cuz BEN CARSON would destroy you morons ! lol sorry ass gossipy tabloid punks ... Im Voting TRUMP 2016 . but id like to see this interview..lol Sheep eats Wolf pictures at 1100 ! haaaa <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON is a world class HYPOCRITE...apparently its cool for him to use dead fetal tissue for medical research.....but not anyone else <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The defense of Ben Carson on here is delicious irony. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump has grown on me as a candidate. Is something wrong with me? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Funny thing is if Donald Trump wasnt running for president,Ben Carson would be leading the polls another non politician! the republican party really messed up after the midterm elections, as usual they promised everything but did they follow through on there word?lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To any normal person this is not an issue but to the Republican and Conservative voters that Dr. Carson is trying to appeal to, their heads are exploding right now. Republican He did WHAT to fetal tissue?!?!? I dont believe in medical research. Thats not what God intended. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does it matter? Carson has no chance of this presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont see the hypocrisy... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I fucking hate Rand Pauls retarded ass. thats why he is getting burned by The Donald <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
he is a typical gop liar for political gain <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is moving oup so CNN sends out the Search Destroy crews. Typical. I see it every election cycle. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This motherfuker lol he literally said the exact same thing where does the already dead tissue come from dude <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn they are digging deep to find or should I say, make up shit on Dr Carson. He was a Doctor long befor the news that fetal tissue was NOT needed for research. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You have half a brain really is closer to what Dr Ben Carson said. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

To all the disagreers, why is what Dr Carson said is wrong? Not all men in prison are forced to have sex with each other, some actually choose to rape another man because theyre horny and have no woman to have sex with. And you cant deny the fact that many prisoners come in straight, but come out gay. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Carson was addressing the question. So his answer was focused on white liberals that have made attacks and expected certain behavior. The radio hosts words are A LOT OF white liberals. Thats not even most and certainly not ALL white liberals. CNN puts words into peoples mouths and twists the truth right before your eyes! And Dr. Carson never said that all white liberals are racist. Thumbs Down for the misleading title! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She starts her segment off by labeling him African American instead of just up and coming candidate... and wants to fake outrage over what he said. Fucking idiots at CNN cant even see how racist they are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Nicely done! You made Bernie Sanders look like the retard that he really is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why are people stupid? I think its pretty obvious that the racists in Carsons comment are those who say youre not supposed to think like this..not all white liberals. In the words of Ben Carson...YOU HAVE A BRAIN Use it people. I cant believe there is a whole debate about this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I have a feeling that the only reason the Progressives are saying Vote Bernie Sanders is because they have no idea about politics and thats the only politician those bleeding heart idiots can name. Hes a democrat, so that means they will automatically vote for him.... without even researching anything he stands for. The typical Progressive herd mentality. Weve seen the same outcome 2 times in a role with Obamo. #VoteTrump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

To quote Dr. Ben Carson, Obama care is supposed to be covering those things, why the need for planned parenthood now? Come to your senses, planned parenthood is the leading abortion corporation in America, nothing else compares and theres lots of money to be made in the abortion business. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im sorry I didnt know that Carsons point was that all straight people are gay? Now Im confused. Even if he got that turned around correctly... hes just siding with Carson on it being a choice... like choosing to do drugs... Way to go Cuomo <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Unbelievable that such a smart man could go and say something so incredibly stupid. This is what dogma does to people it makes them say and do stupid things. Dr. Carson seems so rational when speaking on every topic except when it comes to religion, and religious belief... its a shame. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is so sad <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN really did a good Job of making Trump look Awesome!!! I love it. I cant wait for the debates. Trump is going to slaughter them. With the exception of Rand Paul. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hes topping in the polls because people are sick and tired of politicians. And if the election were today he would have my vote over any of the other politicians running with the exception of Ben Carson. Trump Carson 2016 or Carson Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You might hate Trump as a person, but you cant really deny the fact that when it comes to money he knows better than most other canadiates. AND the fact that he is willing to say yes i was wrong and i made a mistake pretty much puts him ahead of everyone. For me i would say him or Ben Carson for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN Liars. Im a Christian not always a good one, but Ive asked God to forgive me and guess what? Ill take Trump over someone like Rand Paul or Dr. Carson who would both make good Vice Presidents because even though they are Christians, they are also nice guys and American doesnt need a nice guy right now. We need a skull crusher. Someone whos going to shame our spineless politicians and lying, media scum like the worms at CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

that guy is an idiot but an example of how the mainstream media cheapens journalism to a few colorful quotes taken out of context and ben carson was an example of how to simply undermine such tactics....have you read the book? no case closed. then the idiot asks why are you basing the case on the fact that I havent read your book????? are people paid to supress their common sense or does he actually feel this was a valid response. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Do you give based on principles or do you give based on whos gonna do things for you politically? They all love me. I dont know trust that this guy is out for the good of the country. He seems more like he just wants money, power, and respect and being president would only continue to feed that urge of his. So far Ben Carson has my vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Admittedly Trump is not a man of words given the offensive stuff he said about Mexicans but hes still a brilliant businessman, strong negotiator and frankly speaking, the US needs Trump in order to repair its economy and create jobs.

Ok here is the deal if Trump gets Carson as vice president it will be a landslide. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr Carson is a surgeon, Chris Cuomo is an interviewer. Since when does a reporter know more than a doctor?

She may as well have called him a some dumb republican negro. I love how she tries to discredit him, categorizing him and putting him in a little box. This video touches on some interesting subjects for sure, but its just typical CNN garbage at the end of the day. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

White Liberals are racist because theyre stupid. Carson or Obama? Carson has done something with his life while the brain dead Obama cried gimme gimme for doing NOTHING. The choice is obvious.

But, bottom line, he had the smartest, silliest, quickwhitted, most ridiculously hilarious talk show, EVER. No one can top the comedy that Conan has produced. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As soon as someone speaks the truth they get slated !!!!we had the same problem with Nigel Farage he spoke the truth and they slated him this comment has been going around the Media for to long now its ridiculous.

Marriage is a fundamental right. No, marriage is fundamentally religious. Marriage revolves around a vow to love, which is something that could only be enforced by God. Believing in love and in the idea that people could be bound by love is pure spirituality. Since when does the Supreme Court make sacramental rules? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I think we should move a step forward to protect LGBT community with an island of their own they can call home. If you have certain feelings you can go to that island and work things out.

blacks, kill their own, rob from their own, pedal drugs to their own, burn their own neighbourhoods down in a riot. they mostly dont graduate high school and if they get a college degree it is most likely something that is unimportant so they can play basketball. they have 8 times the crime rate of whites.. but it is the flags fault.. ha ha <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You dont have a choice on a color of your skin. You do have a choice on who you marry. There is no law against gay sex. Gay marriage is just two people committing two eachother, just have an unofficial wedding or something. Dont b be changing the law because of your choice Ben Carson is right. His example was kind of crappy, but his point is very reasonable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The confederate flag represents a culture thats not the same as the northern states its like Scotland and England 2 different countrys brought together has the United Kingdom but in Scotland they dont want the Union Jack they want there own Scottish flag as it represents there culture and identity...the southern states are not the same as the northern states let them be <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Carson supports same sex marriage. he doesnt care if people get together and live long happy gay lives. he just doesnt want to call it marriage. its like trying to call a square a circle. It isnt. not an argument born from any hatred or discrimination or whatever. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There are a large number of famous comedians who completely idolized Dave Letterman. The guy has been on TV for 100 years. He was and is the only late night host who was worth Johnny Carson status.

Ms. Banfield says For people who have to wake up every day in this skin, we cannot change it... Why does she sound like she is having such a hard time being black?

Ben Carson is right. Civil rights was a long struggle that got many people killed. Gay marriage has been handed to gays. Gay marriage is a fake civil rights movement. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I get why Carson would bring this up because I dont see or hear stories of gay people banned from certain places or treated as slaves. Gay discrimination is nothing compared to racism. So many a gay people are looked up to and idolised but when there is a famous black person, there is also a bunch of racists who bad mouth them. CNN should really ask better questions because Carson obviously didnt want to talk about a topic that is basically useless <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
America doesnt want another Bush in the White House. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson mentioned Germany of the 1930s because he doesnt want us to go in that direction. The majority of Americans dont want to change the definition of marriage. Marriage should be left to the states. Ben should run for political office. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is just another fascist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is right, People in prison just dont have a person of the opposite gender to have sex with. Thats why they turn out to be gay. Its not something inbred. Its just lust. There are a very small amount of true homosexuals who have some kind of genetic mutation. The rest of them are just lecherous people who dont care about their sexual partners. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

No nonwhite man will probably get the republican nomination for many, many presidential elections to come. And because of the debacle that was Palin, no nonwhite man will probably get the vicepresident position for the republicans nominee. Ben Carson is nothing but a token that fools no one in to believing that the rethuglican party is not all about christianist, straight, white, cisgendered men, especially the rich ones. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shorter Ben Carson We all deserve equal Rights except for gays... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is gotcha journalism at best. Ben Carson has been asked about homosexuality repeatedly, he has given several answers and gave one in this interview and now he has flat out asked What can I do that will satisfy you? What position can I hold that preserves my belief that wont offend you? He is right. There are more important things to talk about. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She want to make news. He gave you an answer, you just dont want to accept that answer. Im with Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So weird. I dont remember a time when black people would lose all their friends, family and churches for being black. So, yes, Carson is right. I think most gay people would choose the option to drink out of another water fountain then to be told by others theyre going to Hell. So, Carson, if you would like to compare the two struggles lets have at it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What Carson said went over a lot of peoples heads when he said what position can a person take that has no animosity towards gay people that believes in the traditional definition of marriage In other words its our way or shut up when it comes to this LGBT BS. They are the n only group with a voice nowadays, them and drug addicts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The only reason that people. namely white Teabagistan, supports this man is because for the two terms of Obamas Presidency they have been told that they are racist because of their hatred of our President.

Ben Carson is right. No one was enslaved for being gay.. There are no restaurants, schools, water fountains only for straights and separate ones for gays. Gays dont have to sit at the back of the bus... Gays have a right to vote... Bruce Jenner was praised for coming out as a woman.... LGBTs have it made in this country.... Try being gay over in the middle east.... They will throw your ass off of a building and continue on with life... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson right again...Godbless you ben for being able to see through these lies.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The difference between being LGBT or being an ethnic minority is that the LGBT always has the option of being overt or covert with their behavioral choice in life. However, an ethnic minority never has the luxury of choice as they can never subdue who they are before the eyes of others. It is possible for LGBTs to choose to change their chosen behaviorsexual orientation at will, but an ethnic minority cannot ever choose to change their physical ethnicity at will. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For once, he was absolutely correct Gay rights are not! Civil Rights the Black American experience is completely different than the Gay experience, though some commonalities exist, such as discrimination. I say that with no malice and no intent to offend Gay people. Anyway, other than that, Id say Carson is singularly stupid in most political matters <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont agree with much Dr. Carson, but on the fallacy of comparing gay to civil rights, he is correct. Are they turning dogs in gays and making them drink from the gay water fountain. I must have missed that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

you see most people are not MAN ENOUGH to admit its a choicedisease !!!!! its a sin which GOD will never accept in his kingdom PERIOD I know there are Christians who might get tempted gay sexual sins BUT it is wrong en I dont care about any MANS POINTS because man will die out en GOD will live FOR EVER EN EVER !!!!!! so yes repent en if only America would choose carson it would get MUCH BETTER <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No one is born gay or straight. As a foetus you have no comprehension of what is outside the womb. We subconsciously choose our sexual preferences just like we choose our music preferences. You can consciously change your sexual preferences if you want to, just like you can change your music preferences. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And the same people said that they most likely will vote for her. Why? Americans know that Hillary is far from the best but she is 100% better than the Republicans alternatives who are antigay, antiblack, antiLatino, antipoor, antiwomen, antistudents, antieducation, antiimmigrants..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Shes STILL gonna be President 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>
If shes the nominee... I wont vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary will definitely get the nomination. And I dont think Republicans have the numbers to win the general election, regardless of who they throw at her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Love Dr. Ben Carson. Im white. I dont care about color. I care about content of character and this man seems to have it. You can be any color or race, but if you work hard, stay close to God and let the Kings of Kings, Jesus rule your life, youll get somewhere no matter who you are. And you dont have to become a brain surgeon, a lawyer...etc. You dont have to have a college education. Thats fine, but be a person of good character and morals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What an idiot. THe only way to avoid having homosexual sex in a prison setting is not to have sex at all, and most people I know would rather not abstain. Sexual behavior and sexual orientation are two different things. So Dr. Carson, are you proposing we offer men in prison females so they can maintain their heterosexuality? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

So Ben Carson is saying that gays can have a civil union and get the tax rights and visitation rights ect... but cant get married because then the definition of the RELIGIOUS CERIMONY would have to be changed.

Ben Carson for President 2016! Why? Because hes the face to change we asked for but never received. Time to stop electing politicians and electing average day Americans who uphold to the values of the Constitution.

Bullshit! If you are in jail and have special needs the sexual kind you have not the freedom to choose, since every inmate is male.

She thinks the minority of people support firearm ownership. Shes in for a rude awakening if she runs for President again. Dont forget she couldnt even beat Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LOL @ the people believing gay is a choice, solely because Ben Carson is a neurosurgeon. He didnt bring up a SINGLE argument referring to the brain or other parts of the nervous system to back up his claim. What he did, was bring up inmates. LMAO.

It is a made up lie, like everything else in science to deceive young minds. In the past twenty i went from noticing two three homo sexual people to where every other person seem to be now. Why is that? We are not educated about the issue yet. We just dont buy the excuse that was given about the science of the sexuality. Maybe that is something Ben Carson can do, he can find out why. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

People actually wanted the death penalty thats so fucked up. Leave that bullshit back in the primitive time in belongs in, not in a civilized highly educated government. The fact that that one guy lost votes because of his anti death penalty stance really makes me worry for this country.

Ben Carson is a real man, a rugged individual. He stands up against groupthink and political correctness. Unlike liberals he doesnt try to silence dissent or use racial violence or beat up women. All real men and women respect and admire this self made man, this brilliant brain surgeon.

Wouldnt it be funny if all the Tea Baggers and hillbillies like me elected this kickass black guy as president? It would disprove all the liberal bull puckey about hicks and rednecks still being racist today like they were 100 years ago. Plus it would totally freak faggots the fuck out too. Win win for America. Vote Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How can grown men, educated, with good lifes and part of the senate be so stupid? Even Ben Carson, the smartest dumb man alive will disagree. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Let me know when the black crime rates in Ferguson go down. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is apparently a highly educated man, an accomplished surgeon but he believes the universe is six thousand years old and was created by an invisible man in the sky. Issac Newton was a genius but he believed in alchemy and thought he could on turn lead into gold. All this goes to prove that smart people can routinely be ignorant and stupid about some things... as can we all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson has his beliefs, just as everyone else has their own. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But I myself believe being gay is a choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
MAYBE BEN CARSON HAS EXPERIENCE WITH HOMOS.PERIOD. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
personally i agree with dr ben carson on his statement about being gay is a choice however, i dont think he defended his argument very well. he should have said that since there is no scientific evidence to prove that sexual orientation is a genetic trait then its ok to say that a person can control their sexual orientation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stupidity is a choice, and Dr. Carson chose to be the best in this field <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does anyone else want to smack Ben Carson in the face? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No matter how much money you got a white man dont give a fuck about your black ass <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is correct <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an absolute idiot who is lacking any sense of reality in todays world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I guess being a brain surgeon certainly doesnt qualify you as a good politician! Dr. Carson dont ruin your public image listening to you speak about the constitution is hard on the ears. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THAT, was disgusting... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Being or wanting to be gay IS a choice one makes, just because you go to prison doesnt mean you go in straight and come out gay unless YOU Chose to be gay So Carson is being obtuse. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have a lot of respect for Dr. Ben Carson, but in this particular instance, he sounds like an idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Haha! Stupid monkeys! Tricks are for kids! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A bigot is a bigot is a bigot, regardless of skin tone. Dr. Ben Carson, open mouth, insert foot. Done and done. I dont think so. Since when did your opinions outweigh anyone elses. Do unto others homeboy, do unto others. #hypocrite <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is idiocy at its height. Prison turns you gay????!!... seriously??? Lets test this theory lock up Carson and then see what happens. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The title is misleading, but then again.....Liberals love doing that. Yawn Carson is one Bad Ass dude. Democrats keep the Black man down by making him dependent on Government. Because of this,they will never know what it means to be Free at last Ohhh the irony..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Evolutionary biologists will tell you that studies show 10% of any mammal population will select for same sex not opposite sex. Ben Carson has let his ideology cloud his scientific training and judgement. BTW most of the prophets of the bible were polygamists and marriage was not between one man and one woman. Stick to neurosurgery Ben because youre out of your element here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have a problem with the fact that when the white interviewer said we have laws in place that fight slavery, and Carson says our Constitution corrected those things. Complete bullshit. As for homosexuality,why df are people so nosy, let them fags and les have their rights. lol shit if it aint your relationship stay tf out of it! Point, blank, period. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im still tripping on the fact that dude is a black republican! Seriously?! And the other black republicans that sees nothing wrong with affiliations with this party and the history of hate towards blacks and minorities. Seriously?!..... Dont care to comment on homosexuality. Im NOT God! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson sounds like Reagan here. He was on the same page on the homosexual question. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LMFAO!!!! Ha Ha HA HA....!!!!! How does that feel Obama? You ignore Congress and the American peoples opinions all the time.... now Congress is ignoring you, you pathetic lying muslim bastard traitor! Get the fuck out of office, get your lying Islamic communist ass the fuck out of America and go live in an Islamic country with your muslim brotherhood friends and family you traitorous POS. I hope you get assassinated soon you fckn traitor! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow! He just won my vote!!!! God bless him for telling the truth!!! I Am sick of these pedophiles aka gays with their rights carp. Ben Carson for president!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson has it right AND The Word of God confirms his view. Marriage is meant to cover 1 woman with 1 man, period. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Chris Cuomo erred at 105 when he failed to question Carsons naturalistic fallacy Whether gay people choose to be gay or are born gay is inconsequential, who cares. Arguably, psychopaths are born as psychopaths yet we dont condone psychopathic behavior. Whether ones behavior harms other people on a consequential level should be the center of discussion here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lmao dr carson sounds white but happens to be black <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder when Carson decided to choose to be straight <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is an intelligent guy, BUT his stance on this one... was idiotic. Its more complex than what he is explaining. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ladies and gentlemen, the stupidest man for 2015....Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow Ben Carson I liked him in the movie better but this is ridiculous <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jesus, these morons sink to new lows every day. How can people support these morons? Ship of fools. I just wish the Republican Party would stop acting like ISIS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a hero! He remained calm and steadfast in his truth. Wasnt intimidated by the host. H a ha ha. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
thank you Ben Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets use Ben Carsons logic Being Republican is a choice so Republicans shouldnt be allowed to get married. LOL Okay, lets STOP using Ben Carsons logic, ever. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson has a point, and slavery and gay marriage isnt the same issue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Ben Carson 110%. Sex is a choice. Its like saying that a rapist cant help himself and has no choice but to rape women. ITs A CHOICE. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson also claims gay marriage is part of a secret global marxistcommunist plot to destroy America and implement a totalitarian global government <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I didnt wake up this morning and choose to be straight. That must be a daily struggle for Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Al Kresta, host of Kresta in the Afternoon, did a segment on Carsons comments and discussed the issue and how to address it from a Christian perspective <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
barack for DICTATOR hillary for QUEEN Ben Carson for PRESIDENT RunBenRun.ORG <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben carson would have been totally fine with the constitution stating that All white men are created equal... Yes doctor it would have been ok for you to legally give you the same rights as white men but we should not change the constitution if thats were the case... and btw we just cured world hunger cause i just ate a big mac... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank you for speaking the truth again and again Dr. Ben Carson.Be sure U put your feet in the right place, then stand firm . Abe Lincoln. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder if this CNN host would be as hostile with Hillary Clinton as he was with Dr. Carson? CNN lefty bias at its best! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
what ben carson is really saying, is that he himself has intense homosexual desires, yet he chooses not to act out his gay desires... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Because of this I will not vote for Hillary Clinton 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson telling it like it is he is going to be hated on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
whew...get me outta here...I have such admiration for Ben Carsons life story what he diddoes as a surgeon. this political arena is going to destroy his human reputation. at best he will lose his posts on boards for speaking in this matter about the topic...at worst it can turn into a Bill Cosby debacle speaking against certain blacks for him...Its like almost any time an African American man goes rogue, they are going to be neutralized one way or the other. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson has more intestinal fortitude than 99.99% of the people in the public eye and Cuomos quibbling is proof of his lack of a reasonable argument! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
meh, who cares what the world says, Dr. Carson is a hero. And I think hes spot on the money where being Gay is a choice #prison <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is just too brilliant for our dumbed down nation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lol. Dr. Carson says no to establishment brainwash. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is brave for his comments. It is a shame the wellfunded progay crowd yet again lines up to beat down a differing opinion. Intolerance? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ben Carson but his religious beliefs make him go way off into left field on some issues. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is 100% correct. You choose to ACT gay. Some may be tempted with that evil, and some are not. To say there is no choice takes away all accountability and it is a lie. Is it a choice to choose to cheat on your spouse? Some think about it, but it is not actually a serious wrong until it is acted upon. The whole point of the left to say this silly diatribe that nobody chooses their sexuality is to take away a possibility they are acting immoral. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Where did Carson get the idea that being in prison turns you homosexual? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I must say, despite the fact that i dont agree with carson stance on this that homosexuality is a choice that was a brilliant argument he made, completely outwitted that butthurt host. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a hero Dr. Ben Carson is. He is a man who fully trusts in the protection of God, and not of man. Powerful. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Being gay will always be a choice. And for those who try to equate a mental perversion with racial realities are just as delusional as you claim Dr Carson is. Lets call being gay what it is A sexual preference. Nothing more, nothing less. Why people are trying to make it this mass social movement I really dont understand. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for president!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson sounds gay. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That Carson guy is as dumb as a motherfucka! <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON FOR PREZ...upright man here <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The constitution accepted racial segregation. People went and physically fought this law. Well, gay marriage is fought. Ben Carson, you contradict yourself. You are very smart and very good in medicine and the decisions at the hospital. But in politics, you are mediocre. People have no control over sexual orientation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The funny thing is, Ben Carson later retracted his view that it is a choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is the best thing to happen to America in years. He is right it is a mental sickness. Homosexuality is a vile filthy lifestyle. homosexuality is the symptom of a sickness that is infecting America, it is the same as bestiality and pedophilia and necrophilia. America is in decline thanks to the liberal mind. Our liberal judges and politicians has sold this country out for the vote. Unfortunately our country will pay dearly <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DR Carson is a RETARDED former surgeon. Sorry, but dont need the PC police to arrest me. Im right! Case closed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Homosexual attractions are a disorder. They cant be stopped in the moment. However, people can curb their gay attractions over time, if they want to, with treatment, prayer, and help. However, Homosexual actions are always a choice. The Reason Conservatives dont want Gays to marry is that Marriage was established as a union between a man and a woman. It simply doesnt apply to Homosexuals. If they want some benefits of a union, then they can make another institution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
being gay is a choice. never judge or hate bc people are gay. i have been to prison and Dr. Carson is full of shit and a fake puppet. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Apparently being a moron is a choice, just look at Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What Ben Carson here is advocating is separate but equal legislature. Gays can have all the same rights we have, but have to be put in a separate group. How did that work for African Americas before the Civil Rights movement? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
we all knew Ben Carson is an idiot now we just have more reason to believe so <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I liked Carson but he jumped the shark here. Hes still smart on most other things is a freakin brain surgeon! Hes not a windup toy like most other politicians. BTW Im a Centrist <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im going to vote for Ben Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The problem here is that everyone misses the point, If a state votes for it, then by all means allow it, if they do not, then it is not legal. Thats what the Constitution calls for, and what Dr. Carson stands for, the rest of the interview is an attempt to get him to sway or back of his Christian beliefs. He doesnt back pedal he stands firm in his beliefs, that doesnt make him a moron, he may be wrong but he has conviction, that is what you should take from this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So by that reasoning, Dr. Ben Carson could be gay! He might wake up tomorrow and choose to be gay. Given the choice, die or be gay, he would probably choose gay. So Dr. Carson is gay, just to be clear! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Americans vote for a Clinton or a Bush were all in a lot of trouble. Not just America but the entire world. Havent we as a people learned anything. Isnt there a candidate that isnt in it for themselves. This isnt high school and this isnt a popularity contest. There should be a law stopping powerful dynastic families. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love you Mr. Carson I really do, but I just cannot bear to support you in this regard. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wait, when Chris Cuomo says that that all drug addicts arent born criminals, isnt he using Ben Carsons point against himself? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Being an idiot isnt a choice, just look at Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mr. Ben Carson should be the the US president! people still cant answer his statement that some people when they go into prison they come out gay. BEING GAY IS A CHOICE! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The sickening Black bastard and alleged Republican Presidential Hopeful Ben Carson has issued an apology to faggots for statements he made in an interview. He had indicated gayness was a choice, citing prison faggotry as an example of this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What Ben Carson said in this video was true to a certain degree. I mean men dont really have access to women so they may turn gay. Anyway I hope he runs for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this man is on the level of einstein ...dr carson is a genius...but he needs to stay with splitting the brain because everytime he opens his mouth he sounds crazy..geniuses need to stay off the camera ...einstein stayed off the camera...men in prison have no pussy, its only shitty butthole..or your hand...now he wants to run for president...go back to medicine where youre needed <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This white dude needs to shut fuck up and listen. Why does he keep getting emotionally fired up and cut him off when he is speaking? Carson is trying to give you his opinions on the topic so just listen carefully and stop being so sensitive like a pussy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ISIS Middle Easts Tea Party The sad truth is, most peaceful Christians would just love to do what ISIS is doing. Fact. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ALL of this disgusting behavior from the religion of peace according to the Obama Admin. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the man. You dont need to change the definition of marriage to give gay people the same benefits. Marriage is one man and one woman, but give civil unions the same benefits, idc. Also what heck was the interviewers point at 145? Makes little sense to me as to why he responded with that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It IS a choice!!!!! I agree with Dr. Carson. Im tired of gay ppl trying to MAKE ppl agree with them and always getting offended when ppl dont agree!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How in the world are you supposed to know, Ben Carson, that being gay is a choice, if you are not gay? Answer that question and get back to me. Ok? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben Carson is right! Why not let two people gain certain rights no matter what their sexuality is. What about asexual people? Cant they get visitation rights in hospital? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good! Dr Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is nearly a Genius. Carson for president!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The reason this video is trending is because most everyone thinks hes a ridiculous fool, to the extreme. Any one who agrees with this guy in the comments section is also one. He has no chance of becoming president. Goodbye Ben Carson, youll have to say something even more idiotic to get back into the public eye. Yes, I challenge you! I dont think you can do it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Carson. No need to apologize for stating what you believe in. Just like people are not afraid to speak out for homosexuality, we should not be afraid to speak out against it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is the man!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson would be an amazing leader for our country <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for president 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson has always vowed that he would remain firm with respect to his conservative views and thus would never acquiesce to political correctness. Now he looks like a monumental hypocrite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
SMARTEST discussion ever on gays... Dr. Carson looks at this whiteboy says, IM BORN BLACK AND DISCRIMINATED, whereas GAYS CHOOSE TO BE DISCRIMINATED hahahah WOW brilliant view <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson really has a lot of great things to say. Just like his mom, when I fucked her last night. Ron Paul 2012 8D <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Very glad to see that hes followed up with mentioning how important it is to be careful about doing pretaped interviews with certain new stations. Too true, Dr. Carson. Must always research the money trail first. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is right. Black is born, homosexuality is behavior. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is so right!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson, when did you choose to be straight? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson should be executed for being so ignorant. Gay is not a choice. Being a bigot is. #truth <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is history now. I knew he didnt have a backbone. TED CRUZ 2016!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Am I the only one that noticed Ben Carson flashing the 666 handsign over and over again for no apparent reason during that interview? Objectivelyspeaking now...Im not sayin, but Im just sayin. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben Carson is amazing! He should be the next president of this failing nation! Maybe he can bring us back from this downward slide that politicians have created for their own gain with complete lack of care of the outcome! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with this. Ben Carson guy 100%! Its like the people who are for same sex marriage bash on the ones who dont believe in it. Its what we believe, it was in the. Bible, if you cant accept our opinion and call us homosexuals then thats ridiculous. Learn to respect everyones opinion. Also, I would just like to make note of how the title and the headline in the video is framed. Its hilarious how they twisted his opinion into something what a villain would say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When did you CHOOSE to be heterosexual Ben Carson? Never. Because it wasnt a choice for you either. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wait a minute, this Dr. Ben Carson is a potential Presidential candidate? Thats terrifying. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Too Little, Too Late Hes one of those Black Men who understands Discrimination 1st Hand and has No doubt been a victim of it. But he chose to demonize another minority in response. I think hes a White Evangelist Christian, trapped in a Black Mans body! Im sure Ive seen people like him on Jerry Springer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
homosexuality is a choice. perversion is never a civil right. What Dr. Carson is speaking on is called institutionalized homosexuality, a factual occurence. homosexuality is abomination homosexuality is immoral homosexuality is unnatural homosexuality is uncleanness homosexuality is perversity homosexuality is shameful <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good on Dr. Carson. He has it right. Anything else is propaganda, i.e., a lie. A circle is not a square. Up is not down. Two men or two women do not constitute a marriage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON FOR PRESIDENT. he will UNITE MUSLIMS CHRISTIANS in the fight against homosexuality. ALLAH JESUS FOREVER!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson must be proud! LOL <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO UNITE MUSLIMS CHRISTIANS in the fight against homosexuality. BEN HAS THE SUPPORT OF ALLAH JESUS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Yes good job Dr. Carson you are 100% right about everything. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson apologized because hes afraid of excons who he called gay. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This world has become so screwed up, nothing makes sense anymore. Ben Carson is an intelligent man of integrity and peoples minds are so warped, they attack him in their ignorance. Just like people hate Bibi Netanyahu just because hes trying to protect his people from genocide. Its like were living in the damn Twilight Zone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

When a person takes the time to read the majority of the comments that gay supporters post.....you see hate. Funny....I didnt see or hear that in Carsons comments. Anger and hate. If it walks like a duck.....well you know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a brilliant man but if he wants a shot at the White House he needs to become a more effective speaker. Is homosexuality a choice, well on some level it can be and thats his point. You cant choose to be white or black in any instance, but in some instances you can chose to be homosexual, and I think thats his point. One can be changed, one cannot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is right. Being gay is a choice. Its not biological nor anything else. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I support Dr. Carson but I think his answer was incorrect and rooted in a lack of knowledge and understanding of sexuality. In his defense, he has written an apology for his comment on his Facebook page and it, in my opinion, makes him one of the most humble candidates weve had in a long time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson should stick to medicine. As a follower of The Bible he is choosing to believe in ancient myths. Which would he choose for healing a licensed medical doctor or a witch doctor <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson, running to Oval Office requires a very deep experience in politics and it seems that you havent gained enough yet. I suggest that you just continue your medical career and hopefully one day you might find some cure for cerebral diseases. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You have got to be kidding me. Carson, youre a fucking idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is ignorant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Liberals are so racist thats the only reason why they dont like Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What baffonary! This homophobe needs professional help with his own sexuality. How can what people do privately with a consenting adult still be in the discussion? My tolerance for this type of blatant bigotry is gone. These people scream Freedom for all! as long as you agree with their vision of freedom, which isnt freedom at all. I cant wait until the fine Dr. Carson is caught on camera having sex with his next door neighbors husband...what an asshole! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really dont like your manner of twisting Mr. Carsons words CNN... You have one less viewer from now on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is so full of shit and is apology is BS ! A lot of people go into prison straight and come out gay what an idiot! Carson has also said samesex marriages will lead to acceptance of pedophilia and bestiality, etc.. This dummy is not a serious presidential contender. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Huh? For being such an intelligent man, Dr. Ben Carson sure does display an exceptional amount of buffoonery in this interview. And the fact that hes a neurologist makes his statements even more vexing. I used to have so much respect for this man. Now? Not so much. Though he is entitled to his opinion... no matter how asinine it may be. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson told the truth. It is a fact and guess what? Oh yes you already know the prisons are loaded with our black men! This fuck up CIA bullchit agenda to exterminate us with king alfered plan aka rex84 is bullchit. Dr Carson shouldnt take that back just as GuiLLiani didnt take his comments back! Double Down on them! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you were stranded on a desert island with your choice of Dr. Carson or a mentally challenged blonde woman named Tina with a coconut bra, body of a walrus and laugh like a hyena, Id still pick Tina. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Most people are confused on which way to vote with respect to a thumbs up or down of the video. I give a dislike to Cuomos interview and a like to Dr. Carsons responses. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Ben Carson........He tells it like it is..........He doesnt try to sugarcoat the gay disease.............He doesnt mind offending black people or HoeMoes............. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson that was brilliant, thank you for explaining #bencarson2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for President. This man knows this country. Anyone thinking he disklikes gays is brainwashed by CNN. Watch the video again. He SUPPORTS gay rights. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Straight people do not go into prison straight and come out of prison gay. If anything, they engage in samesex acts while in prison because of the lack of availability of opposite sex partners, but stop if theyre straight after getting out of prison. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As much as I have respected Dr Carson, this is the stupidest argument he has made so far! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Had me laughing! Nice job Carson on being brave and courages against those who you knew would disagree! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To give homosexuals the same privileges as married couples you dont have to change the definition of marriage...Carson is correct. Cumo should be fired mentioning slavery. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DR. Ben Carson....... a man who is ABSOLUTELY ignorant on sexuality. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hmmm... fuck you Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Has Ben Carson ever considered that prisoners prior to their incarceration had homosexual thoughts and feelings? And use Jail as an excuse to act on out them? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No backbone <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn right...it is a choice... Im liking this Ben Carson fella more and more..plus he did have valid points...jeep marriage sacred <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A lot of people dont agree with your beliefs Dr. Carson me being one of them but kudos for standing up for yourself and your beliefs. Just hear his side more next time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
trying to normalize being gay...opens the door for other demons.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why does anyone think Dr. Carson is qualified to be President? I dont get it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
NEW BLACK PRISONS? The brain of this lady is full of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
don lemon is cringe worthy with his line of questioning <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Gosh he is so smart and well spoken and an amazing neurosurgeon but I really cannot respect him because he is just so hateful and ignorant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree wholeheartedly with Carson and the issue of gay marriage shouldnt be compared to slavery. Besides, someone as intelligent as a neurosurgeon really shouldnt be challenged. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like how Chris Coma tries to sound smarter than Ben Carson, but fails miserably. LOL!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For all the dumbasses in the comments who disagree with DOCTOR Ben Carson, I challenge them to get out of their mothers basements, go through 12 years of medical school, and become a neurosurgeon like he did. Ben Carson has more intellect in one of his fingernails than any miserable gay fuck hiding behind mommys computer has in his entire body. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Dr. Carson please tell us all exactly when you made the choice to be straight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I just dont think Ben Carson is presidential material. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whatever chance Dr Carson had of becoming a presidential candidate was just destroyed by his display of ignorance regarding homosexuality. And hes a doctor!! It just goes to show you that even people who are doctors can think stupid thoughts. Oh well... nice try Doc. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WHAT A IDIOT! His career is most likely done after that blunder. Opinion or not. Thats probably the dumbest thing Ive ever heard someone say on live tv. And this man wants to be president. Good luck on your party agreeing with you Ben Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck ben Carson uncle remus ass motherfucker he not only had had gifted hands but lips to match ass kissing uncle tom ass bitch <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Some people just dont understand the Christian view of homosexuality. It is wrong, but just because someone disagrees with another persons actions or lifestyle doesnt mean that they hate them. No good Christian man, which he seems to be, hates ANYONE. Props, Dr. Carson. God bless you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is proof that rape is a choice. Dr. Carson youre a heartless Pharisee. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is such a horrible person, for saying such things! I mean come on, what he is saying is way worst than ISIS throwing gay men off of roofs. How do I know this? Well because I have not heard the gay community say any thing to condemn their actions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is a brilliant man, who speaks the truth honestly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I want Ben Carson to be president. Unfortunately, theres no way the voters are going to allow two black men, one after the other, to occupy the White House. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would like to see Ben Carson tell some recently released inmates that they are gay after being in prison. I think he would bite his tongue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Perfectly explained Dr. Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am a Carson supporter, but being gay is not a choice, you dont wake up one morning and just go oh....today is a good day to suck a dick, so Im gonna make a choice and suck one, come on bro, you were doing so well <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Without a doubt the biggest retard in history. Being gay is NOT a choice its a fact of genetics. And basing your hypothesis on some stupidity thought up while you were probably on the toilet voiding your body doesnt mean your a genius and just solved the mystery of the century. On a serious note, I worry for any government that would even slightly entertain Dr Carsons appointment any higher than he is. Lets hope he loses the race!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im certainly no doctor, but I have to wonder if we arent seeing the onset of Alzheimers disease or some other form of dementia in Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ben Carson more and more every day... So glad hes running!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I fully agree with Ben Carson! Its all a matter of choice! Sex with same sexpartner is an abomination and repulsive!! They are like dogs smelling each others assholes! Gay behaviour is so disgusting they hide their gayness from their closest relatives! I hate being gay and therefore dont practice gaysex! Its disgusting and filthy! What gays do to each other NO normal person will do! But they are driven by lust and not love! Sies!!! Repulsive disgusting behaviour!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree saying Absolutely is a little much... because I think SOME people are wired to be gay. You cant say absolutely about much of anything in Science. But a lot of men leaving prison choose to be homosexual after prison. To bitch and whine about Carson for pointing this out only shows the world what a bunch of hypersensitive funnel heads you are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson standing up! Stand up for whats right, not what people say is right. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson must be anti gay the most common answer from the gay community. cause they will never answer the most fundamental question out there why were we not all created gay from the beginning? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I AGREE WITH DR.CARSON,!!! GOD MADE A WOMAN FOR MANPERIOD! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is NOT ready for prime time, let alone the presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Being homosexual is definitely not a choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He is honestly just embarrassing himself at this stage... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The truth that your not hearing out of people like Ben Carson and the majority of the anitgay male conservatives is this We hate the thought of two guys having sex but given the chance we would quickly jump in the sack with two hot lesbians. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So is BEN telling us hes gay but CHOOSES not to act on his impulses? If its choice, that must be the case, right?? AND to those who choose to argue this point, do you recall CHOOSING to be straight?? DO YOU HAVE HOMOSEXUAL URGES THAT YOU CHOOSE NOT TO ACT ON??? BECAUSE if its a choice, THEN YOU MUST ALL HAVE HOMOSEXUAL URGES YOU CHOOSE NOT TO ACT ON! Right?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i really like ben carson a lot, i wish he would stay out of politics though and stick to science. politics will ruin his good name hes got a point though, remember the movie firday after next? that big buff dude turned gay <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WHAT A DUMB SHIT CARSONPALIN 2016 BRINGING DUMB MAINSTREAM!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson pointed out that you should not need the state to recognize your marriage in order for you to get the Benifits of being married. I bet most stupid Americans missed that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love this guy. Ben Carson should be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This Carson dude is ucking crazy. And hes running for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson by the time I reached ninth grade, mother.received nothing but food stamps. She couldn have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy. But now that hes rich he became a republican and welfare for others is unacceptable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson should just stick to surgery. You dont expect your car mechanic to have a wealth of wellthought ideas concerning the sociology of different types of people in the world, do you? And somehow, I bet you wouldnt be too excited to vote a car mechanic as president of the USA either. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
MY GOD, its about time somebody spoke up. Being gay is a choice. No one is born GAY. Thank You DR. Carson. Every one has a choice, some choose t comment crimes some choose to be child molesters some choose to be Gay. Its just Nasty and I dont know why me promote this lifestyle. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Following up on the very last sentence Dr. Carson uttered in this video the answer is civil union. All they have to do is make civil union the legal equivalent to marriage and this whole issue would go away, and you keep religious folks happy. This is not rocket science. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson is gay. Just chooses to abstain from homosexual acts. So far of what we know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is a idiot. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I see so according to this idiotsavant the fact that I can fuck a plastic doll makes me capable of deciding to fall in love with it and spending rest of my life as a dollsexual man. Very brilliant deduction, and it speaks volumes about Carsons own Bible enforced imprisonment into situational heterosexuality. No wonder his wife looks the way she does. It really didnt matter! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Science has failed to bring any evidence that Homosexuality is inborn or genetic. Sorry Cuomo, you are wrong, and Ben Carson is right. NEXT <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youre going to be hated for your beliefs, Dr. Carson, but kudos and good on you for standing up for them. Its necessary and needs to be present in such an arena because few others will stand up like that and defend the position. Let the hateful names people call you for simply having an opinion that doesnt agree with theirs, slide right off of you. They amount to little more than hypocrisy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You would NEVER hear even the most right wing politician in Canada go out on national television and say something this ridiculous. Glad I live in a country that respects gay rights 100%. The fact this guy is even considered by the media as a contender for the white house is a joke! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes saying he doesnt believe gay marriage is a legitimate marriage, but he essentially supports states allowing it. Why all the debate about whether homosexuality is a choice or not? That is completely beside the point. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have huge respect for Dr. Ben Carson but hes hardly an expert in psychiatrypsychology not even an A.P.A. member he is a Neurosurgeon WORLD RENOWNED AT THAT but that hardly makes you an expert on HOMOSEXUALITY. Example those straight men might have already been dormant bisexuals to begin with or that incarceration leads to predatory secondary sexual characteristics in men. And the fact that were even considering this as a question in 2015 is really appalling. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carsons reputation used to be unquestionable. Now, hes just destroying himself and it seems no one around him is offering any advice. IDK what his goal is but one thing is certain, he will never be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think dude is a repressed homosexual, seriously. It is obvious he thinks a lot about this one of those Christian repressed types <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God bless Ben Carson PS He should discuss this subject more from a Biblical view. #JesusIsTheLordAmen <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He is right homosexuality is a choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You think being gay is a choice? Absolutely. Why do you think being gay is a choice? Because a lot of people who go into prison, go into prison straight, and when they come out theyre gay. I must applaud Ben Carson for this statement. It has been a while since I have seen someone perform a circus of stupidity in an interview. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr ben carson is stating facts being gay is a choice fuck u people if you disagree the man is telling the truth <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The title is clearly misleading, the conversation was about gay marriage and it veered off unnecessarily into ones opinion about sexuality. For the record, Dr. Carson wasnt against gay marriage or gay people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LMAO ben carson owns. He raises an interesting point, consider the classical era ancient greece rome, homo eroticism was widespread, probably much more common than it is today. Was that a genetic trait that is no longer present today, or was it something learned and promoted culturally? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for president!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
do some research people. Its a fact that a large number of men who enter the prison system for extended periods of time decide to engage in gay sex for the first time in their lives. Its also true that upon release the same men continue gay sex on the outside of prison. But with that said I dont believe this proves homosexuality is a choice. However, I do believe this man wuld make an exceptional President unlike the gutless bafoon who sits in the White House currently. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When is the new Batman vs Superman trailer gonna be released already ? Also, Ben Carson is a total closet case <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Typical racist Democrats. Its OK when Clinton says it because hes white, but not when Carson says it. Typical of the party who forced black people into slavery to now try and alienate the biblical values of Black America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stupid nigga. Inmates dont have a choice to whom they fuck do they? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Smart guy, interesting guy, but he doesnt have the formal experience to even get a nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson, I like you but you are wrong about this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The saddest part about this is not that he thinks he can get the GOP nomination but the fact that hes a doctor! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The smartest dumb guy in the world <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ben carson is right to say it is a choice, I use the example of inmates too <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with Dr Carson. Give gays all the same rights as marrieds, but they must call it something else. For the sake of depth of language, new words should be coined I propose barriage for two boys and garriage for two girls leave marriage for one boy and one girl mixed! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LOL LOL Its shocking to hear someone like Ben Carson who is considered as an intellectual , think that men who went to prison as straight and then came out as gay is because they choose to be gay??? THIS IS SO ABSURD, damn this gives me a big migraine. So does he knew their lives before they went to prison ?? for him to say they were straight?? does he knew them 100%?? WHAT SENSE DOES THAT MAKE ??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please Dr Carson, make known your ideas on how to replace Obamacare. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i cant wait to vote for Dr Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson for president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Ben Carson equality and the rights of all people of colors in this country should of been decided by each states also??? each states should of decided whether or not all people of colors in this country deserved to have the rights they supposed to have as human beings??? Me as a black person I can say that THE IRONY OF BLACK HATEFUL BIGOTS LIKE HIMSELF IS MIND BLOWING <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is Carson trying to say he was gay in youth detention? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Dr Carson!!! Love it when progressive idiocy is shot down with logic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If being gay is a choice Id like to know when in his life exactly did Dr Carson decided to be straight. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with him performing gay sex acts is a choice, not something completely beyond a persons control. Other than that, I think Carsons a very brilliant idiot, a frustratingly halfwit smarty pants with a few good points here and there. And Im sure plenty of ppl disagree with me. Fine. I am impervious to your insults and your arguments. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A man with no political substance <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No worries white people Carson is just looking for a Pat on the head by white people. This is just to bolster the lie that Black people hate gays.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dr. Ben Carson is a fucking bigoted idiot ! If I could choose to be straight , dont you think I would ! Its hard to be gay ! I would love to marry my lover of 16 12 years , we only want the same rights as anyone else is afforded ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

HEY Morgan Freeman you should be ashamed that you are calling out tea party and others as racist ............

This guy is stupid. Jay Leno Letterman Jimmy FallonConan Jimmy Fallon was definitely the top choice over others to follow Jay. It was stupid of NBC to force Jay off the Tonight Show. Carson picked Jay to be his successor. Jay does like Jimmy Fallon and they get along so he felt it was fine to give it to Jimmy Fallon. It was wrong to force Jay off the show. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This was a very thoughtful debate, in which neither side said anything to slander the other, or got upset, or started using derogatory homophobic hatespeech. ... if only the comments section could figure out how to do that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

the IFB doctrine is SOOOO NOT BIBLICAL the scripture warns AGAINST such abuse, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why the hell would someone get less votes, because he or she opposes the death penalty? Can someone explain me, why you want to murder someone. And that that is even possible legally. The only reason to kill someone is because of self defense. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youve wasted 2 and half minutes of my life watching this bullshit, and I still saw the soldiers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Their acting a fool for their own, but the death of Eric Garner couldnt even get a moment of silence screw the NYPD. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If this doesnt motivate you to join the protests, then I dont know what will. Lets keep up the momentum, make our voices heard! Our lives are better off today because of the sacrifice made by protestors in the Civil Rights Movement. We stand on the shoulders of giants. The sacrifice we make today will benefit those who come after us. What we need now is modern day MLK to galvanize change. These protests are good but we need a leader to better organize the masses. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He was a lunatic with a violent history. Nothing more. But the mass media and bigots want to make him into a terrorist to reinforce the negative male violent image of the black male and promote more division and fear within the masses. He is no different than Eric Frein who killed a state trooper in Pennsylvania. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Haha. The ultimate car window. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this caused an uproar? cus ppl still believe that everything they see in a vid is real? But these ppl even buy large TVsets for a shitload of money to watch even more stuff they can uproar against. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Doc Carson should have stuck to Medicine. He doesnt seem to know absolutely nothing about people as it relates to human affairs and well being.

Carson is one smart dude! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
GOP where is Rand Paul? That is your only hope to save your party. As a republican i am tired of rhinos like Romney....btw who the fuck is ben carson. oh a black guy, who isnt running? I doubt there was even a poll! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Darren Wilson is a true piece of shit. Only a piece of shit would support him. YOU know who you are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is so qualified because I said so, and I am of the American people. Hes just a great guy living in this world and I think he would be an absolutely amazing president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Regardless of the outcome... he was going to not only have to resign, but leave the the area. Guilty is the only verdict most black will accept. Screw any evidence that might exonerate him. Hes guilty... hang that cracker. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Oh great, here goes huckabee and carson rolls eyes <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its been long enough, so lets all admit it Joan Rivers was a total hypocrite ass. She had no boundaries making fun of the most horrible things and backstabbing Carson, but if anyone even said the least little thing about her, wow. This interview is just one instance of that proof. The world is a little more pleasant place now. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
compared to this Obama, Carson is over qualified to be president. As least he has run a business before. Obama had never run anything but his mouth before being president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WHY THE FUCK IS THIS ON THE NEWS? Lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Having an American sort of education i.e. zero solid knowledges, this Talking Head from CNN has no clue about types of missiles warheads. For instance, the warhead of mentioned BUK AA system contains a large amount of steel shrapnel that would rip the Malaysian jet on millions of almost coinsized pieces. Looking at traces on wing or holes in wreckage of crew cabine, it seems that the civil jet has been downed by AirtoAir missile of aircraftmounted gun. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I trust him, I donated and I will vote for him if he runs. I want African Americans to work beside me. I want America to be great again, to be respected but most importantly I want us to be united. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would vote for Dr. Benjamin Carson in a heartbeat. Intelligent, classact, genuine and a MAN. He grew up dirt poor with his brother by a single mother God Bless her.

The Libs go into character assasination mode like drones withuot the slightest understanding of the subjects at hand or even the meaning of their own words! Ted Strickland as he shuts uptalks over Dr. Carson Noone is being shut up in America Stricklands ultimate show of stupidity Well, then maybe you cant judge a book by the title He says this as if it means something different than wht Dr. Carson said ...you cant judge a book by the cover. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ya know, I dont see how Dr. Carson was comparing Obama to Hitler. He was making an analogy. It was an extreme analogy, but an analogy non the less. Also, I never heard any grumbling when those on the left were comparing Bush to Hitler, so their indignation is rather hypocritical, though not at all surprising. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Totally agree with Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
XD carson is on some serious crack <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN got sum really retarded folks there Dr. Ben Carson aint one ov em lol! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anybody who didnt vote for Obama is a racist. Anyone who doesnt vote for a black person now or in the future is a racist. Its that simple. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am a huge fan of Bill Mahers but its his love for Jay Leno that I cannot stand. Sure he makes great points but its my own personal bias against Jay and his brand of comedy that has me irked everytime someone speaks highly of him. Oh and btw Bill, its a good thing Jay doesnt have an agent. Its the very reason he is so reviled to this day because the last time he had one, that bitch bullied NBC into passing over the beloved Dave Letterman. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cheesy as hell. This shit is on the national news? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
DR Ben Carson the last hope for humanity <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I respect Dr. Ben Carson. I looked up to him growing up and still do, even though hes Republican lol. Hes saved countless lives over his career but comparing Obamacare to 911 haha. Obamacare didnt set us off on 2 wars in the middle east nor did kill it thousands of people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson for President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is exactly right. Wake up people! Get your fucking heads out of your iPhones!. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson Stand tall stand your ground, as always. Whether or not you run for president, you already have inadvertently surrounded yourself by the clamoring of thousands of goodhearted, Godfearing American people! God Bless You. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ROFLAO!! CNN would actually ask that question of Ben Carson after being a cheer leading squad for Obama? Seriously? Nobody in earth was less qualified to be President than that clown. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why is that blonde horse faced women even in the presents of such an intelligent man ben carson? shes so forceful its irritating. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is not qualified to be the President of the United Stateshe is OVERQUALIFIED! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That white idiot making his rude out of context comments to Ben Carson is a disgrace. Dr. Carson makes sense! Dr. Carson cares about our freedom of speech, Dr. Carson wants to get rid of everything immoral in our country. They guy is a gift from God in Heaven! Ben Carson for president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Carson Did you read the book? Sttickland No Dr Carson I rest my case PRICELESS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ouch!!! Making a jack ass sound like a, well, JACK ASS!!! Dont underestimate this great man. He just may come to power one day. And that would be a BLESSING!!! Carson 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson is a true credit to his race. If more blacks emulated his thirst for a better life, all the while contributing to society, there would be no Detroits....and we would all get along so much better. But the militant, givemegiveme blacks hate him because he truly exposes them as the scumbags they are. And the comments on this thread prove that. DR. BEN CARSON FOR PRESIDENT 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Smack down! Great job, Dr. Carson! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look at that mans face 129146....compare that face with carsons bold face....so priceless. This shows who looks like becoming president....carsons voice is always calm and has resounding confidence <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even a bird has more brains. It is telling the Squirrel to... get off the road, you nutter! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, never heard of Ben Carson before watching this video, but I like what I see. This guy gets it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That was some gradA pwnage on Carsons part. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahahahaha!!!! This is my favorite clip EVER!!! This just makes me laugh and laugh... why would ppl dare go up against Ben Carson...? ...So embarrassing for the both of them!!! He might as well be speaking to elementary school students!!! Ahhhhhh... made my day right here!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is right on, and, Former Ohio Gov. D Ted Strickland, et al got their rear ends handed to them. Learn to read Ted, it might save you from embarrassing moments like wiping egg off your face someday. Oh, and go join an anger management support group while you are at it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson made this dumb motherfucker look like a sure nuff stupid asshole... Get em Ben!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What is so hard to understand what he is saying. Gov. Strickland is just taking comments out of context to try and destroy Dr. Carson. Good ol Alinsky tactics. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
omg I cant stop laughing Carson just owned those liberals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Another Dumb DimoRAT trying to put Dr. Carson in that box. Go Ben, make a fool out of Strickland. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson once again makes the CNN talking heads trying to trap him look dumb. So glad this guy is not politically correct. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He will never become president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Carson ate their lunch, love it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love it, thank you Dr Carson for putting those two in their place. Maybe if the clown who is criticizing Dr Ben had read his book he would have an intelligent comment. lol Good one Dr Carson, good one. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These CNN talking heads trying to trap box Dr. Carson in look foolishly partisan. Go back to searching for flight 370 for 24 hours a day, your just as relevant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She is supper annoying. She speaks fast and she doesnt listens, this is a major problem with politics. People want to stand out, want to be known and want to be right. Ive warmed up to Carson, seeing he keeps very calm, is very smart, listens, and his answers are thought out. Must be all those years of doing surgery on brains that he is patient. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN trying to trash a very viable black conservative presidential. Wolf Blitzer did exactly that some time ago but even worse with Ben Carson. Its funny with liberals the more precise word leftists that the only black people you deem worthy are those on the left. Its you who try to put black people inside a box the leftist box and then you curse and intimidate the blacks that DARE be conservative. Shame on you and your double standards. Oh! You have no shame. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is a brilliant man. The lady with the blond hair should be at home cleaning the kitchen floor and not in his company. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To speak with Dr. Carson you have to have an A level of intelligence. He has to dumb it down to these CNN host. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow Dr Carson, you are amazing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CARSON IS A SAMBO HOUSE NEGRO <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON IS A UNCLE TOM <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson avoiding the question....the dude hadnt read his book, so he said he rested his case? Now that was weak... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These news folks have an image of a perfect America, Dr. Carsons statement is not out of the ordinary at all, I agree with him. One thing is watching the show, and another what heppends behind the curtains. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson just prison raped that poor man and did it with a calm smile on his face. Sheeott. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Dr. Ben Carson go!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Amazing how much shes willing to push to strain an answer from him in order to boost their CNN ratings. Listen closely woman! 1 for Dr. Carson <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When you have the First lady telling school children to report their parents for politically incorrect thought you are living in a Gestapo state. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Uncle Tom Carson! He likes it when the gop pat him on the head, because hes a good monkey <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is a nut to compare Nazi Germany to the USA <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
1 for Dr. Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He is saying that Americans are being too complacent about what is going on like ordinary Germans did before and during WWII. It isnt a complex statement at all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hilarious Johnny Carson was the best nighttime entertainer ever. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As much as I hate Donald Sterling he has a point. Should kids really look up to a man that had sex with every female in every state in America? someone who has HIV?

Ted Nugent told it like it was. He was criticizing President Obamas policies not his race. And he spoke the truth. Ben Carson or Herman Cain would have made 100 times the President Obama ever would. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Bundy Just wonders if a system that condoned beating, rape, murder and the selling off of people from their loved ones would make for a happier existence for Black people? Saddest but to no surprise is how many of his twisted Caucasian brethren see Bundy as some kind of hero. I Just wonder the younger Malcolm X had it right. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I guess ben carson, obama, neil degrasse tyson, and other innocent black people would be better off as slaves. Does this idiot understand slavery <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So, am I the only one who caught the context of Dr. Carsons remarks? He wasnt specifying white liberals as being the most racist although the interviewer was rather specific with his line of questioning. Dr. Carsons reply was in reference to individuals who assert that blacks should think and act a certain way. This appears to apply to any group of people from Dr. Carsons point of view. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If she goes to fox news, her reasoning for leaving cbs is not the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Conan will go down as being one of the funniest, if not the funniest guy to do any late night show. America just wasnt ready for his style of humor. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Of course B. Clinton, the Wolf of Pennsylvania Ave is going to hate T. Cruz. Cruz stands for something. Clinton was an impeached President manwhore who stood for nothing and got nothing accomplished.

Fallon is the best choice because he is in some ways much like Johnny Carson....but of course Johnny is and always will be the KING of late night. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr Ben Carsons mother realized when she was cleaning houses for well do to families that being well read and getting an education is what would lead her children from the ghettos to a better life. Dr Carson when being interviewed for residency at Johns Hopkins so impressed his interviewer with his knowledge of literature and music he got the coveted position. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Both him and Ben Carson need to get into politics. He is completely correct. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Personally, I DonT Find this Fallon to be funny! I stopped Watching Jay Leno like two years ago, but every now and again i watch a few minutes of his monologue because he be saying some funny and brutal things about people!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i thinkJay was the best late night comedic host since johnny carson and he proved he could stay unbiased in his comedic spectrum, unlike some other hosts who were and are too careful to be politically correct and therfore not use the vast amount of political satire that they should NOT be afraid to use! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am not knocking this piece, but I have seen several news segments that puts young black men in lowwage ,low skilled jobs, many times before. How about putting young black men in the corporate business world, even if some might not like it, at least they know what is it like! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When Dr. Ben Carson criticized Obama, he was audited by the I.R.S. extensively...5 years in a row. The Obama administration also warned him to stop publically disagreeing with Obamas views, policies, regulations. King Barry and the LGBT community, what hypocrites. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Making fun of someone does not reflect a persons talent... rather, it shows how incredibly immature certain commedians can be, and that they themselves have no talent seeing as how they have to make fun of other people in order to be funny. It wouldve been more impressive if they didnt attack people in their jokes! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Well, Ive said it before Ill say it again Steve Martin was one of the candidates to host the Tonight Show when Johnny Carson retired, he should have been seriously considered when Jay Leno retired. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
funny how you people say when a cop murders someone its horrible but when someone is emotional unstable and the cop dosent kill him, you say he shoulda been murdered ? which one is it. idk about you but i think its best if most situations ended like this with the man arrested and the cop going about his day. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Murdochs simple strategy is this Step 1 Help get another Democrat elected. Step 2 Continue fear mongering via Faux, NYP, WSJ, etc etc. Step 3 Profit .... This is not an endorsement, folks, he actually believes Carson has less of a chance of winning vs Hillary or Bernie, and he is correct. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

After the planes hit the twin towers the Mexicans in Mexico city were dancing in the streets celebrating and within an hour they were wearing special Tshirts and partying to celebrate the destruction and deaths.

To make a fuss over Trump recalling the horrible images of that day is ridiculous. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump, Carson, and Huckabee although he has no chance are truly dangerous people. They are fanatics that will end up getting lots and lots of people killed in the name of religion or terrorism or whatever. I really believe that Carson would love to start Armageddon so he can see Jesus. And Trump will kill millions out of sheer ignorance, or to be poplar on twitter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Awesome. The American who understands American People. I would like Trump, Cruz, Rand, Carson all working together. They are all better examples of statesmanship and patriotism than any unAmerican democrat in the race. But Trump led from the beginning, led all the way.

157 What he should have said is, unlike Dr. Carson I am not willing to kill 100 innocent men women and children to kill one member of ISIL. That is the reason there has been so little bombing.

The days of a nice president are over. If we dont stop the progressives its all over. Iowa voters better get it or they will pay dearly for their nice bullshit. Carson needs to be discredited.

I like Carson his very honest man and Trump is good business man. Umm I dont know which one to vote for. What if I vote for Trump, I mean the guy is control freak can be selfish, he was a shark and still is. Question is he might make a quick money now but we really intelligent person whose plan for 50 years to 100 years from now. We dont need short term loan sharks like Trump thats my point. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Funny how none of the stories in a Carsons book match the facts in real life and carson blamed it on the media and then says obama wasnt vetted that way, i remember obamas birthers going after hard even now the Donald doubts it. way to go carson, get yourself in a corner and blame someone else for you getting there, ima vote for freaking curmit the frog the GOP is sucking now <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Now is NOT the time for a gentleweak approach to a roughhard world. Carson is weak on immigration, weak on 2nd Amendment, just to name a few. The CORRUPTION in Washington would EAT HIM ALIVE. But, mainly, hes NOT the one to beat Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump eats politicians for breakfast, thats the toughness we need. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People are saying Ben Carson is too nice, very weak and so on...Its funny to see how most people try to judge a book by its sheer cover! In fact people who are calm on the outside are the one that are strong within. They say hes low energy. WHAT!! He was a neurosurgeon who used to stand several hours operating the most complex of issues on human brain! Im not trying to persuade people to think differently of Dr. Ben, I just think it would be wise to think rationally. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What people need to understand is that Carson is not a polished politician, what he said sounded wrong but thats not what he was trying to say. He was trying to say that if someone had a gun they could fight back this killer! if someone had a gun that day a lot of lives would have been saved due to the power of self defense. It was a horrible day and he is not blaming the victims he is trying to explain a political point but he said it in the wrong way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rubio is too young and it shows. Carson is a moron, and he lied on the Mannatech question. Trump is too immature, and he lied on the Zuckerberg quote... Hillary, even worse, responsible for the death of an American ambassador. Jim Webb was a better candidate, maybe he dropped out too soon. Sanders will be unable to accomplish anything except gridlock. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

ben carson is my political hero. he dont take back anything hes says cause he doesnt say anything without thinking. the media is trying their best to trip him up but he is way to smart for their tactics <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media dogs should leave Ben Carson alone and stop messing with him. Hes an okay guy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson talks common sense of course you dont stand there like a sheep waiting to be slaughtered and yes maybe some teachers should be armed as long as its volunteer and as long as they have extensive training like cops do <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And the end result would have been Ben Carson getting shot in the head. What a stupid immature comment he made that only a child would have said. Every gun owner thinks they will be the one who will be the hero when the end result would be themselves ending up shot or they will end up accidently shooting other innocent people in total panic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Actually all that Carson said makes sense and I agree with him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the intelligent president we need , Carson 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

So called Controversy is in your own progressive liberal mind. You took a statement out of context and turn it up to make an explosion. People can read the whole statements by Carson and there is nothing there that was not true. I predict Ben Carson will get a lot more support from the people because you turn an innocent true statements into an unnecessary so called controversy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These comments do not haunt Ben Carson whatsoever, what bother the liberals at ABC is the fact that his statement was absolutely correct. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Having a muslim in office? The question is WHY would anyone want a Muslim specifically to be our president? They begin to question Ben and Donalds opinion? Ok we all expected for Donald to get hazed, but what Carson said is true. Somehow the media made Carson look like a villain! Mr. Carson is nothing but a nice rational guy. The media is ran by the government apparently. It is beyond scary on how they try to control us.#Trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carsons remarks will not in the least damage his chance for the presidency with the huge silent majority in this country, in fact he is gaining support.

Why do people have such an issue with people telling truthfully their opinion? If you dont like what they say then dont vote for them. Better yet, if the new media doesnt want to hear the truth, maybe they shouldnt ask the questions. Many of us want a president who tells the truth for once and stop playing games, if you are one of those people then prepare for the truth to hurt at times, thats life. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Joe Biden is right behind Ben Carson. You have one fucking job monkey. Read the propaganda news and he cant even do that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Going from Ben Carsons speeches to this one, there appears to be a noticeable exaggeration on feelgood sentimental storytelling and evangelism, and a noticeable lack of answers to problems or any actual acknowledgement of objective problems.

The solution is simple. Cops should just protect white people. If a black person calls the cops no one should come. All issues resolved. No one is going to get killed after trying to kill a cop. They will loot their own stores and kill their own people. Perfect. If your reaction to a cop telling you to not walk in the middle of the road is trying murder the cop then maybe you dont deserve protection.

The root of the problem is Mileys and her moms relationship with Christ. Miley is letting the opinions of the world dictate how she acts and dress. As a believer, Gods opinion is all that matters.

I am a very honest person, and I got full scholarships from all the Ivy league schools, even though I never ever applied.

Shame on CAIR for slamming Ben Carson. Officials of CAIR should slam islam instead. Is denying of freedom and equality part of islam? Is that inconsistent with the American constitution? Is that what Ben Carson said about islam? Is he right? Of course he is! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this was the smartest thing he has said and done since beginning his campaign. Trump will not win the nomination, mark my words. he is alreafy starting to slip, and carson is a black racist! fuckin imagine that, but then again most of these candidates are racists <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cant take the truth about Islam eh Whitehouse! White house has been infiltrated by Islam! Ben Carson tells the truth... take it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. Islam has no place in a government for the people, by the people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Got news for you. Telling Americans to not let Ben Carson be president because he would not support a Muslim president is far more unconstitutional than anything Ben said. By the way, I wouldnt vote for a Muslim president either because of the conflicts that are evident between the Koran and the constitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All he said was he wouldnt vote for a Muslim. Muslims can run for president regardless of Dr Carsons opinion. This guys request for Dr Carson to withdraw makes no sense at all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why not turn the questioning to these CAIR reps. Maybe questions like.... Do you denounce Sharia Law and Pledge your allegiance to the US of A? Isnt this Muslim gentleman doing exactly what he is accusing DR.CARSON of ???? So Carson cant be president because of his religious beliefs? you better ask yourself why people would leave their country, where their god rules and come to a country where Infidels rule and the culture clashes with their beliefs? Think hard now... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ben Carson is right. We shouldnt have a muslim president, not now, not ever. But for the sake of devils advocacy here... Lets have the muslims elect a jew for head of major a arab nation first and then we can see about the muslim for president thing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Presidents are puppets. If they dont obey, they get a JFK. Both parties are funded by Zionist Rothschild Jew banksters. If they are not Israel firsters, they go nowhere. Carson is a Zionist. We are ZOG Zionist occupied government. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

So, Tea Party Republicans are antigovernment when a racist, white rancher squats on federal land and is kindly asked to leave, but theyre proPolice State when innocent American citizens are attackedkilled and their civil liberties destroyed.

When Albert says team Carson that means two team emerge. Dumbass Albert! You know, Albert was a ten year prisoner hes gonna steal our team Chargers. He still a crook, a crook is still inside him.

Now forever cops will be afraid to defend themselves because of all these racial shootings <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, it started off good. I mean they tried to talk him down at first. I dont know why they couldnt have spent a little more time before provoking him with the rubber bullet.

i do not understand why the American masses are so dumbed down that they do not even realise that the popular vote does not matter, and still has the gall to talk about liberty, freedom and all that crap when it clearly is a fascist country that does everything on the whim of the rich. i laugh whenever theres a American Presidential Race. at least bring back Sarah Palin, u guys have no idea how much joy she brings to the world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Stupid people commenting about satan worshiping. Have you even listened to the lyrics of the song? Have you watched the video?

All lies from the liar of countries. War mongers! There can be no peace as long as Israel is run by Zionists. War by deception is their motto, and you have been deceived. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary will run. Hillary will win. Warren Buffet I agree. I cannot imagine any of the following Republicans being elected POTUS Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Sarak Palin, John Kasich, Donald Trump, Chris Christie, or Marco Rubio. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

So lets take a look at this preposterous list of Republicans who are seriously considering running for Pres. in 2016 Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum, Ben Carson, Rand Paul, Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Ted Cruz. Come on, does anyone really believe any of these neanderthals could ever be elected President? Its obviously gonna be another freak show like the GOP primaries of 2012 were. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Joe didnt do it. He earned those wins. His generation didnt know how to handle this type of perversion. I was abused sexually as a young boy by my sister in law for years under the noses of my parents and my big brotherher husband. When I finally told my dad 20 years after the fact he said I knew it! But he never confronted the sick pedophile. I still loved my Dad. I didnt judge him. No one should judge Joe. His family has suffered enough. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This is a simple smear campaign. Dr. Ben Carson is going to be running for president and with the backing of a RESPECTED man like Cosby, the black vote would swing conservative. The socialist agenda takes a serious hit with a President Carson. Cosby is the first of many in a long line of conservative blacks that will take a hit to theyre character. Isnt funny how ebola was stuffed down our throats, PREELECTION. Mysteriously, its not much of a media topic anymore. Wake up!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In other words, SUCK IT, SHITHEADS. LOL. Remember the Alamo, dummies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
AP has integrity. Thats why they did ask. This isnt Larry King. Cosby tries to hide behind the word integrity, which he is constantly misusing. You dont lose integrity by asking the real questions that you are trying to run from. You gain integrity by asking the real question. Cosby knows that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
