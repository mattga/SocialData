I blame Fox News. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everyone says Cruz is a great debater, unfortunately what makes him great is that he never answers questions. The interviewer can repeat the sentiment or idea Ted JUST said he supported back to him in the form of a question by saying, Ted, do you support a religious test for refugees? Will he answer the direct question? Nope. Never. Hell dance around it, attempt to change the subject, etc. People think hes honest and forthright....but hes the EXACT opposite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
that reporter questioning ted cruz is scum, lowlife liberal human garbage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ok, he is now the Worst President in American History. Piece of shit!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That piece of shit presides over 8% of the Americans....so why is he given any airtime at all? The moron is NOT MY PRESIDENT nor does he represent me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

God help us. We need Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, or Donald Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wheres Ted Cruzs highlight on mainstream media bias ABC? That received the loudest applause of the night and changed the entire direction of the debate. In fact, Id say the theme of the night was the Republicans banding together over mainstream media bias and the direction CNBCs moderators wanted to take this debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio is too young and it shows. Carson is a moron, and he lied on the Mannatech question. Trump is too immature, and he lied on the Zuckerberg quote... Hillary, even worse, responsible for the death of an American ambassador. Jim Webb was a better candidate, maybe he dropped out too soon. Sanders will be unable to accomplish anything except gridlock. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
note how they intentionally ignored Ted Cruz <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Boehner Screw this, Im tired of cutting deals with the Democrats while the Tea Party refuses to budge. Republicans Gosh, I dont want it! I dont want to be responsible for the Tea Party!

Kim Davis Countys Clerk is not issuing marriage licences under Gods authority, even though she was employed by the United States governments authority. Isnt it time for the US government to step in and have this woman arrested for committing treason? It is clear she does not hold allegiance to the United States, therefore she has no business acting as a public servant. get her out of office immediately. This woman is making a mockery of the judicial system. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

My black and latino brothers and sisters really everyone, please learn more about Bernie. Hes not the typical white man from the goodoldboys club. Hes genuinely progressive, and will fight for legislation that will help not only every american, but in particular communities which suffer inordinately in terms of unemployment and taxation. Hes your candidate. Hillary is bad for us, anyone on the right is bad for us regardless their color. #BernieSanders2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You Americans shouldnt elect a religious fanatic who somehow manages to connect everything to the God Almighty or Jesus Christ!

Ted Cruz invoking respect for the US Constitution is laughable being that he welcomes NSAs spying on Americans. I guess Cruz like every other politician only support the constitution when it benefits them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Make no mistake, if you vote Republican in 2016, you are voting for a corporate dictatorship. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He wont win, but he seems to be a better choice than most. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The reason I would vote for Bernie Sanders is because of the honesty. No other politician would EVER say that America should look more like Scandinavia. I absolutely respect that and he speaks the truth. Unfortunately, the media is going to fuck him over for ratings and the Republicans will just keep throwing out the word socialist to demonize him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I think he makes sense and seems to be a good leader. But he will not be able to win with the pseudoscience behind manmade climate change, especially not with the development in California right now natural climate changes, and the inability with traditional liberal progressive politics to plan for such things.

Ted Cruz scares the fuck out of me. Say what you want about Obama and his domestic policy but hes made great strides as far as making Americans more liked outside of the country. A Republican president will be 5 steps back on foreign policy and 50 steps back in science and equal rights. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She only has two accomplishments in her political career. 1. She married Bill Clinton. 3. She didnt divorce Bill Clinton. I guess that means its her turn to be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes! Great news. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yey. . . yet another establishment politician ready to divide America on issues I love the mess she created in Egypt and Libya while working for Obummer.

In another word, youre only feeding people that already hate Hillary and will never vote for her anyway. The way I see it she is being attacked because she is a woman.

Ted Cruz doesnt give a single shit about anyone whose not giving him single large donations over 100k.

Using christians own ignorance against them.

It is disappointing to hear that Ted Cruz disparages Rand Paul to donors in private. Obviously Rand cares about Rands campaign and Ted cares about Teds campaign, so I guess you cant blame Ted for wanting donor money for himself over Rand.

Now that she has Finally Officially announced her intentions to run for President, expect the Republicans to launch a political assault in an attempt to neutralize her. This will not work, Im afraid. In fact, Im going to go on a limb and say Ted Cruz will be the first candidate to drop from the race. Why? He was not born in the U.S., therefore, he doesnt meet the basic qualifications.

Cruz is unelectable under any circumstances. The Republican base won accept him because he is Hispanic, Hispanics won accept him because the Tea Party and Republican Party won accept them and the general electorate won elect him because of his rhetoric. He will do well in the South and Central West, get killed everywhere else and get gutter stomped in the Electoral College. He is add water and stir defeat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I was an Army Officer, a Police Officer and a lifelong Republican. Thanks to Regans Big Umbrella, Ive watched the lunatic fringe drag the party farther and farther to the right, to the point where the Republican Party is no longer the party of the college educated but the party of religious zealots and big money. If Cruz gets the nomination I will leave the party. I dont care if the Democrats run Warren, Id vote for her before I voted for a dogwhistler like Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Senator Ted Cruz says Net Neutrality is Obamacare for the internet... Only an idiot believes that. The Republicans need the vote of the people to get into congress, but their true masters are corporations. Republican voters proves that America isnt great, but full of fools who vote against their own interest solely for the sake of hating the president. They are the most gullible idiots on the planet. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is this article missing something? The first half is praising Obama for taking a stance on protecting the internet, but the second half is about 3rd parties commenting that Obamas goal is control. What am I suppose to take from this? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We are going to get more internet freedom by implementing more regulations? Only a dumbass progressive could find logic in something so stupid. More freedom comes from less laws, not the exact opposite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fat boy making an ass of himself just kissed his chances of running for president goodbye. Voters will tolerate goofy mayors that do drugs and fall down drunk. They will for awhile tolerate politicians that email photos of their genitals or governors that are corrupt, but never some buffoon that runs his mouth and bullies as president. NEVER. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

And I guess this is still Obamas fault? Never mind that Republicans and Texas have been railroading illegal aliens into the US since 2001. Bush even had illegal aliens from the Mid East.

Actually Trump was first to call out the media and the PC crowd since the very first debate not Ted Cruz but Mr. Cruz did a good job on calling out the media and Mark and Trump and Chris. This debate was one of the best that I have ever scene and Im sure the liberalcratic CNBC just wanted to make the GOP look bad but instead it back fired. As for the Democrats debate, its like watching window paint dry. I hope the lame stream media keeps exposing themselves for what they are. Go GOP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This debate will go down in History specially Ted Cruz comment. It will forever change how moderators behave in debates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I loved it when they set these unprofessional moderators were set in their place.! I loved it when Ted Cruz gave the the moderators an ass whoopin! The moderators were so unprofessional and did not ask questions the people wanted to hear about resolving any problems in our country. The 30 second and 1 minute responses is also ridiculous. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everyone I have talked were so disgusted with the questions that the moderators gave. I loved it when they set these unprofessional moderators in their place.!

OReilly is wrong. Ted Cruz was more than willing to answer the question, John Harwood blocked him over and over. He also answered that same question from Brett Bair the next day. What Ted did changed the tone of the debate completely. Before that, people were actually answering the stupid questions on the moderators terms. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Laura Ingram, Michael Savage, these are the moderators that we should be using to vet these candidate. That wont happen however because then the republican voters would see the RINOs unveiled and the RNC cant have that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
With so many media sources the so call main stream media myth is just a cop out for republican Cry Babies who want to pass blame for their inadequacies. Ted Cruz is acting like a child and a stupid Texas politician. Stop passing blame and stand up! Cry Babies can not be President!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz was born in Canada. You do still need to be a natural born citizen to be president or did I miss something? Somebody help me with this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like that they said they should ask them questions about their tax plans. Thats exactly the question Ted Cruz is responding too. These people are a joke.... Moderator Cruz, how about your tax plan? Cruz Fucking liberal media. Fox News Fucking liberal media, wont even ask about their tax plans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Jeb Bush stinks of desperation. His weakness on illegal immigration makes him an extremely unappealing candidate. Cant wait till he drops out so his points can go to other republicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only talking heads whining about the CNN moderators or their ?s are the racist, sexist, homophobic Republi cans their ilk. IMO the moderators were razor sharp fact checked those blow hards around every turn. The debate was awesome, but now I bet the next one will be stacked with right wing types will be a total snooze fest, every one of these Republic bafoons getting on their soap boxes to run out the two hours st8 into an old rerun of The Golden Girls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The most unbearable man in politics. I agree that the moderators were looking for a food fight, but they also asked these GOP punks to CLARIFY their dumb positions. Like how you can make Mexico build a wall for us, deport 11 million people and how we can afford your fairy tale tax policies which all of them enormously favor the rich <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNBC illustrated a typical liberal mindset. Smug and ignorant at the same time. They condescend while displaying their own ignorance and getting their ass kicked. And their only retort is personal attack. Thats why you typically see that from them. They cant make a logical argument so they attack personally showing their weakness. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id vote for Ben Carson, but Ted Cruz is my favorite. He and Mike Lee were the only ones that stood against Democrats and the traitor Republicans on Obama Care and tried to get things done. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Snarky, obnoxious, hostile, snide, insulting. Wow you just described Megyn Kelly when Fox hosted the debate! Compared to the Fox panel, I think CNBC did a far better job, and the candidates got to discuss real issues, not war on women BS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz completely destroyed these moderators. I never thought I would say that....The candidates shouldnt have to debate the damn moderators. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Boy, Fox is really scared of Ted Cruz. Even though he is #3 on their poll, they cut his name out and only show Rubio and Bush as if Cruz didnt even register.

Got a lot of respect for Mr. OReilly. But the GOP Gong Show has simply went far right, and these talking points are pathetic. Mental patients like Trey Gowdy and the user car salesmen Ted Cruz, along with Ben Carson Donald Trump 2 individuals with no experience, or relevant credentials, among others, have made the GOP a partisan disaster which morphed into a train wreck reality show. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I have always been a Ted Cruz supporter. But more and more I am leaning toward Carson. The only doubt I have is how his faith will impact his decisions.

Remember Jimmy Carter gave Iran to the ayatollahs. Obama gave Iran atomic weapons! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

All this election and winning game is based upon is the personality and how the candidate comes across..... not on positions so much.... and these are really all not that different from each other.... it is the pretentious Hollywood act that matters..... there is nothing intellectual about it.... it is all about what the fairweather populous is ready to stomach. Now isnt that awful....? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz is spot on with his analysis on Islam, the excuses they say and use when causing riotous killings its pure bullshit.Islam wants to take over the world it is nothing more than a evil cult and you dont want Muslims in power because they will use that to push thier Islamic influence on the world. Christians need to fight these evil bastards and stop them. Im glad America have woken up to this its a shame UK are too stupid to realise this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz was born in Canda. Is he even eligible for becoming president? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

And...The media just hates that The Donald remains on top. Personally, Ted Cruz is my choice. Just wait. Miss Carly will hang herself. She talks a good talk, but she is not Presidential material.

the truth is that almost 60% of Republicans have said they will never vote for Donald Trump this is a staggering number when you realized it only 7% have said they wouldnt vote for Ted Cruz even Chris Christie only has 32% that says they would never vote for him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz once again offers no solutions and no ideas. Just empty rhetoric and scare tactics to get your votes. He is backed a Super PAC and billionaires. Whos interests do you think he is going to represent? Yours? Hahaha. Bernie Sanders is the only real choice not this clown! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
yes but, is voting for Ted Cruz good for the Jews? this is the paramount issue here. the voting bloc needs to ensure that they are voting properly for a candidate that will stand by Israel, no matter how many wars the US finances, fights or dies in for them. no amount of blood spilled is enough to ensure that they are kept safe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TED CRUZ 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am worried for all the people that might believe what these guys are saying. The Iran deal is a great deal. It is better than no deal at all. These guys just want to spread fear and really want to go to war smh. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant believe Ted Cruz would say something like that. Hypocrite! Homeboy swears hes a Christian. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz would be a terrific President. Of course, a Muslim could be President and I would support heshe if they supported America. Majority determines the Elected Officials in America, you cant please everybody. This is the first time Ive heard this CAIR jerk speak out about anything. Has he said anything positive about America? Has he said anything publicly against slaughter of Christians by Muslims? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So Ted Cruz would have been happy if Obama ordered up 500,000 troops to wage war all over the middle east, right? NO! He would have been on the floor of the house saying how dare Obama be a tyrant President and put our troops in danger <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz is saying the same thing. Obama loves, apologetic, too weak, etc... with Muslims and Radical Islam, and the world now is trembling down, how much more if an open true Muslim would lead America.

Yep first the Muslims tell Germany to give up their Oktoberfest and now the Muslims here are saying Ben Carson should not run for President for expressing that he would not support a Muslim for President.. He is speaking for those of us that are tired of being threatened by Muslims and coerced to make special way for them at every turn. We refuse Sharia period. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Again, the media blows a simple opinion by Mr. Carson completely out of proportion. In addition, the sound bites edits out the context as to WHY he said what he said. Why is it a top story? Ratings. Pure simple. However, the blonde lady is definitely offering a clearer understanding of Carsons remarks than that guy named Rivera, who thrives on fallacies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz, I read your book. I have to admit, I skipped most of itI didnt buy it to get a family biography. I was interested in your Senate experience. I like you as a Senator.

Ted Cruz sounds like a fucking robot. Like theres a computer talking moving for him. They must give them the questions ahead of time. Because his answers sounded so fake and practiced. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The actual winner is Ted Cruz. With everyone claiming that they had a moment on Planned Parenthood, or Iran, or Russia, etc. Ted Cruz has been the only one talking about these issues way before anyone walked into the Reagan Library last night. Wake up! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is not a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz looks like a pedo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox defends Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio all the establishment , proamnesty, RINO traitors. Then Fox attacks all the principled outsiders, Trump, Carson this surprised me because I thought Carson did well and Im a Trump fan so it exposes Krauthammer for his phony establishment views, and a backhanded compliment to Rand, but then goes on to compliment Christies pathetic night. Christie did NOT look good... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Could one sane person actually see Dr. Carson as a presidential nominee? I think hes not well spoken, and i could not see him negotiating a Iran redeal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What did you think of Trump? I thought he didnt do well in the first debate says Krauthammer, which of course means hes clueless because after the first debate Trump soared. Nothing got lost in the shuffle as Kraut said. People heard Trumps answers and more and more began liking him. More and more republicans are realizing that its best to vote for a nonpolitician. So Trump, Carson and Fiorini will be the top 3 and 2 of them will comprise the ticket <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The race is really between, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz.

I hate to point it out, but when Dr. Carson was born, an African American could be jailed in at least 16 states for marrying a white person, and a lot of those laws had at least some roots in the religious beliefs of the legislators who passed them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz and Donald Duck are nothing but a pair of Zionist stooges doing any thing to keep the US in never ending wars.for Israel. Just watch the way they kiss Netanyahus ass.

Mike Huckabee is the former governor of Arkansas. Ted Cruz is Senator of Texas but if he is in Kentucky with Kim Davis, he should either be in Washington DC working or here in Texas telling us what he is up to. Last Friday Cruz was in Houston attending the funeral of murdered police officer Darren Goforth, and that is where he should have been. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Enjoy political suicide, Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz. I cant wait for footage of K Davis saying racist things emerges like Cliven Bundy to really get some egg on political fundamentalist faces. Matt Staver is the devil. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I worship Gozer the Gozerian I must kill a child as sacrifice. I have religious freedom. Do you really want a Christian theocracy.

I figured after last weeks revealing the trump was lying about how much money he had, lying about his plans, lying about his families mob connections, and lying about basically everything he said since he started talking as an infant that he would be out of the race.

Well if Ted Cruz didnt mean that how do I know what he trying to say.David Uncletom Clarke said prez Obama and Eric houlder,etc were starting a war against police.Thats a lie.When cops get killed cop killers are brought to justice.Its not the same for when people get shot unarmed.People have to protest just to get in a courtroom for justice.Good cop are the ones that suffer.Bad people will always have the advanced in American culture.Bad people kill cops and good people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

With such a large percentage of IGNORANT or racist? morons on your side, you have NO CHANCE to ever again send your candidate to the White House. Get some education, then try again! 2016 is LOST! Hello Hillary or Bernie? Trump just guaranteed your win! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

He just realized that?? Trump is neither Republican nor Democratic. Like other people said he is speaking his mind, not by any restraints.

It is good balance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Make america great again and get rid of all the immigrants. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THANK YOU MR. TRUMP!! PLEASE HELP OUR ONCE GREAT COUNTRY. I agree, people like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz should not be citizens of this country. At the very least they should be forced to change their names to something more American. And what about Dr. Carson? We need to seriously consider a Dred Scott like bill so America can be great again. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank you Mr. Trump for bringing the truth to light. All these immigrants have ruined our country.

Ted Cruz is a fucking nut job, fuck that bitch <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The real ideological threat to the US are all these politicians using the Bible to govern the land. Theyre the ones waging jihad on the US. Not ISIS.

No questions about Ted Creepy Cruzs Canadian birth certificate, but chastising Trump for Rosie ODonnell insults. Huh?

Republics are nervous now. Obviously the audience likes Trump. Donald Trump is not a puppet and does not have to fear to tell you the truth. As well, trump could expose the corruption of some politicians and can use this against them. They have nothing on him that would cause his downfall. Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and Trump are sincere and would love them to work together and get our country back. Thank you Mr. Trump for giving us hope. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Seriously, how in the hell does Ted Cruz get by citing the IranContra Affair as good diplomacy? Cruz is a smart man, and knows better. Hes plainly dishonest, and makes points to his advantage based from dishonest premises. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I cannot believe the Trump supporters. Do you people understand what he said here? He said that single payer would have worked in America fifteen years ago. He didnt say it was a mistake to support it, he said he was right to support single payer then. That makes no sense. How can so many conservatives support this man? Especially when there are better candidates! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz had no clue but not that I blame him. The reporter named two obscure incidents, and then fed him the answer, then asked him to comment. How is that balanced? Loselose situation for Ted. Or maybe winwin depending on how you look at it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz dose not have any balls! President Obamas term is up, but when he is asked about what HE would do to defeat ISIS, the first thing that comes out of his mouth is Obama!

Ted Cruz is right in his answer ...and he is willing to put his finger on the problem, that is important, PC will only get you murdered, telling the truth puts a spotlight on the bad guys and tells them up front, we dont trust you and will be watching you, and you will pay for your misdeeds even if you say your god told you to do it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow Ted Cruz is a nut. Are you serious? Of course kids have no choice to join places like ISIS, if Ted Cruz was 12 years old and grew up with nothing hed be influenced to join too. Its true they do need <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I still think ted cruz runs with the rest of the Zionist corporations rand paul is solo against the NWOnew world order If RAND PAUL doesnt win this country going to the shitter ...just my thoughts everyone has an opinion... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz cannot run for President. He was born in Canada. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz says hes signing up for Obamacare Cruz2016Obamacaresigningup20150324id634268 <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz and Rand Paul for 2016!!!! they will save this country. they fight for our freedoms and protect our constitution. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have never voted in my 47 years. I will vote for Ted Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, that was some creative editing and taking Pauls statement way out of context and responding to it with a bit of nonsense about Ted Cruz an avid conspiracy theorist and his credentials. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
rand paul isnt principled,he supports some illegal immigration. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No republican has a chance against Ted Cruz. TED CRUZ 2016!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No one should vote for Jeb bush <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Take everything David Mercer said about Ted Cruz and apply it to Obama, perfect analysis! lol Its Ted Cruz vs the American people?? facepalm, its been Barack Obama vs the American people for the last 6.5 years in case you havent noticed!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
NO HIllary and HELLLLL NO Bush!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz will beat all of these so called conservatives. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Ted Cruz or Rand Paul would come out and say they are running as third party canadates separate from the Republican Party they could start a political revival throughout the nation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz will crush Rand Paul. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Do they pick people who have no personality on purpose? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz will win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul is the only one that can sway moderates and obtain the youth vote. If they give the nomination to Jeb or Ted then they will essentially be handing the presidency to the dems. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Rand Paul has the best shot but Rick Perry is almost like Reagan. Ted Cruz had a good message, When have you ever stood up for what you believe in. He was probably the second most like Reagan. It really feels like a Reagan era right now.USA is going to get its dignity back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You dont have to be republican to be conservative... you dont have to be democrat to be liberal. Jeb Bush is a liberal republican. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youre looking at your next President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
War drum beating. Opponent insulting, not very Christian like if you ask me. I never hear policy suggestions from this guy just talk <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TED CRUZ 2016!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rick is a joke. Bring us Ted Cruz! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I WONDER ID TED CRUZ BEATS HIS WIFE ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WOW TED CRUZ AND GOV RICK PERRY JUST SAID THAT ROBIN WILLIAMS IS IN HELL FOR COMMITTING SUICIDE..WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU CHRISTIANS ? MY GOD HOW FUCKING EVIL <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump and his ppl are just fascist there is no other word <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is an amazing opportunist. He is a master at marketing and propaganda, or at least his handlers are. Ted Cruz destroyed CNN moderators and this liar attempts to mock it for his low information voters. Why doesnt this guy just be an actual leader and stand up to Putin or come up with an idea to go after ISIS instead of fighting Republicans? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The best America could come up with? Ive met immigrant food cart vendors on the streets of NYC with a better understanding of the world at large than these buffoons and liars. Proof that money doesnt always buy quality. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id say Ted Cruz handled the moderators nicely. Obama cant seem to handle his own promises. No boots on the ground in Syria? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Amazing, an openly Christian conservative man of science who is not afraid to say what he believes. Can you imagine something like this happening at a time like this. Do you suppose that other people might be willing to speak up now? He doesnt just say what everyone knows. He actually thinks for himself. Wow, how shocking, how dare he? I hope he perseveres and that he is able to make a difference. I think he already has. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BRAVO TED CRUZ AND TRUMP!! I ADMIRE YOU. I am a woman, HispanicLatina, came to this country in search for values, freedom of speech and dreams, and I lost all that with OBAMA! I know you will fight to get all that back, WHAT USA is all about! I WILL VOTE FOR YOU!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dare any GOP candidate debate against Bernie Sanders. Someone with half a brain needs to put Trump in his place. These guys are on par with Televangelists and used car salesmen. SCUM. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz for President 2016..... CRUZZZZZ on to the White House Ted Cruz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol Ted Cruz already talking like he is the President United States <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not a fan of Trump... That being said, Hed be a joy compared to Ted Cruz or really any of the other republican candidates for that matter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One thing we know for sure is Ted Cruz did not read this Deal. 159 pages are you out of your mind. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Mcarthy Cruz <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Rick Santorum, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, George Pataki, Donald Trump, Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal AND Scott Walker they all running for president. Now the Republicans will have to decide which one of these men can lead the Republicans to another CRUSHING DEFEAT. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fact Hillary could win the presidency if all America women voted for her. But its usually known that its time for republicans to rule in 2017. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obamacare is unaffordable for willyDyer and teabagger and it is free for Ted Cruz as a politician even if Ted Cruz opposed it. Anyway, it should shut it down in 2016. We do not vote for a politician who do not repeal obamacare. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
obamacare is free for politicians but not free for teabagger and willpdyer as ordinary citizens. So it should be abolished! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is a problem with obamacare, it pick and chose health system. when ted cruz will become a president then he can also taken obama and his family from benefiting the healthcare system in 2016 in executive order bwhahahahhaha <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I guess it boils down to this Who do you trust, a bunch of dumb ass right wing tea baggers, who dont care about anything besides power and enriching themselves, or do you trust what could be the greatest Secretary of State in our history ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wasnt sure who to vote for. NOW I know for sure that I am voting for Clinton! I never watched this video didnt have to but I am certain that the conservative republicans are the reason that this is even an issue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its embarssing the POS in the Whitehouse doesnt seem to know what the real threat is. Obama is a disgrace. Can the United States trade obblabber for Bibi?? I only wish. Obamacomminity organizer, coward. Bibiworld leader <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz 2016. Stand with Cruz and stand with Israel <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great night for America when we rejected this walking check book for president. I wonder what other conservative goon republicans will try to throw at us in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
More likely REPUBLICANS WILL BE BLAMED. We control the House and the Senate, former Homeland Security Chairman Peter King RN.Y. told The Hill on Friday. Americans KNOW THAT WE CAUSED the last government shutdown, so we have the lasting specter of Ted Cruz hanging over us, he added. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I mean what sort of a future are we headed for when people do not trust government, science, medical scientists, climate scientist, and educators? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I voted for President Obama I wish I could vote for him again in 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dear Republicans, Tea Party, conservatives and fundamentalists Prepare yourselves, you have a minimum of 10 more years of Democrat leadership. Once Hillary declares shell run for president, its all over for you. Barry is witty, uses humor wisely, and speaks so eloquently. This was one of the best state of the union addresses, ever! He sure scored big with his comment I have no more campaigns to run...I know because I won both of them. BOOM <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My brain lost IQ by listening to her speech. Extremely robotic as if she has never done a speech before. Makes you wonder what her state was thinking... wait... they werent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
thank god a republican will never be president again... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a Republican... she makes me sad. If this woman is the face of Republicans, I will vote Democrat again in 2016 as I did in 2012. She makes me want to jump ship. The GOP is dead. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im surprised anybody showed up to listen to this clownshoe. obama wasnt even born here lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Without a doubt the GREATEST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME!!! I LOVE my president! !! GO OBAMA! upvote if you agree. Also who else loved his zinger in the end I know because I won both of them...POW! greatest president ever!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz, the Republicans poster boy against immigration reform??He was born in Canada.He father was born in Cuba.His mother born in Ireland. Wow!!! And, Cruz kept it hidden that he had maintained dual citizenship until he was outed for it. This man wasnt even born in the U.S.A.!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To my fellow conservatives who stayed home in 2012 because Mitt Romney was not Ted Cruz I have one question....Are you happy now? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama aka barry soetoro is like Satan who challenged Jesus Christ bwhahahhaha <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The socalled border crisis this year was deliberately orchestrated by the White House.

It is the fact he is black we are going to war and you are still not satified what more do u want him to do. Maybe instead of critizing this president there is a 2016 election coming up u should run for president.. I think u need to be honest with yourself and accept u are a racist <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Some republicans caucus envy Ted Cruz, Rand Paul for tenacity, ruthless but fair and fresh ideas. McCain is not helping the republican party obviously <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This woman is dillusional! It is her GOP party that has created a lot of the inequality that plagues our nation! And,dare I mention Ted Cruz,the guy who put us all through a 16day Government Shutdown? So,dont even! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What have you been doing for the past 5 years if you are only going to take action now? Your actions are the reason our economy isnt doing well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I think we now know who CNN and the media elite are afraid of <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im Ted Cruz and I approve this message. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ted Cruz. Cruz is the only honest politician who openly rejects the fake oldNazi dogma about a behavioral gene, the fake Marxs religious dogma of dialectics and the fake dogma that natural climate change is unnatural. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is even more disgusting than Trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would actually vote Trump over Cruz. Never thought a day would come that I said Id vote for Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is truly a pig. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is Canadian and can eat multiple dicks <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like the fact that Ted Cruz had exposed Sierra Clubs scientific arguments about global warming as a fraud and the fact that Ted Cruz rejects the fake oldNazi dogma about a behavioral gene. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
he calls ted cruz crazy for continuing to do what he promised his voters he would do if he got elected. is that crazy or a politician that actually tries to do what he promised? bill clinton is a hack that was impeached his word is as good as his wifes shit. this peirs morgan comes to america and advocates to change the bill of rights... what is wrong with that picture? lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Americas next elections will be the most feared and stressful. We might be at a time when the US is actually dumb enough to vote for this guy. Lets just bite our finger nails and cry as we see our next country leader be elected. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When you see how hard main stream media is trying to slander Ted Cruz it is a clear indication that some, if not all, of his views are valid. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Here is my theory on motive the man is really the Sasquatch. After receiving a Rocky Mountain high from his bud, he got the severe munchies for baby back ribs. This is why the news keeps saying he uttered BABY PARTS. He probably sounded like a cave man for example Mmmmm me need baby part me hungry. Theory makes more sense than Ted Cruzs claim that hes a left wing tranny who is really a woman. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant believe republicans want to shut the government down over something that only makes up 3% of the services that PP provides. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN contribute to these type killings by giving a national platform to conservative rhetoric by people like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump etc. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whats interesting is watching these pols tune their acts to the venue. On Colbert, Jeb! said My brother wasnt a conservative... and Ted Cruz acted like a rationalminded persons secular angel. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TED CRUZ 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald Trump should be afraid of a great man like Ted Cruz an imbecile like Donald Trump who is only in the race in leading the polls because of Liberal Democrats and majority name recognition these morons dont give a damn what he says in a majority way they just know his name hell I bet you most of them arent even Republicans <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald Trump has the best chance to beat Hilary Clinton. Who do you think does? Ted Cruz Yeah ok face palm <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Ted Cruz wins the Republican nomination Give the presidency to Hilary Clinton because he doesnt have a blue chance in hell to beat Hilary Clinton <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruzs theatrics to help shutdown the Syrian refugees has caused other programs to be shutdown as well. One case is a man in Iraq that fought with US troops during the war, and has been waiting 6 years to come to the country he served. Thanks a lot Ted, you fucking scumbag cocksucker! Your werent even born here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You mean Ted Cruz isnt running to be Trumps running mate? Remarkable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Daily reminder that nobody cares about this. Trumps numbers will continue to rise at the same rate that the antiTrump pieces are peddled out by the media. Thankfully, nobody is listening anymore. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope every single college zombie goes out and votes for this guy in the primary... So then ted cruz can wipe this guy off the debate stage! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This dude was at the kill the gays rally , Ted Cruz THE FAGGOT HATER. Hes got GOD on his side. And CNN is not talking about it. Whats up with that CNN? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is an ugly mofo. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I particularly like that Ted Cruz has exposed the Sierra Clubs scientific arguments about the global warming as a fraud. I also like that Ted Cruz rejects the fake oldNazi dogma about a behavioral gene and exposed the GOP leadership in Congress as catering to Obama and Democrats who, in turn, cater to 1% rich monopolies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

canada is bringing in 25,000 over the next 6 weeks. i live in government housing so a lot of them will end up in my neighbourhood. 30 years ago neighbourhoods like mine looked like sons of anarchy. africans, afghanis, arabs have been moving in in big numbers since 2001 and the change i see is instead of biker wannabes you see nice gardens and neighbours who sit in front of their homes in the cool of the evening. bigotry is ugly. ted cruz is nasty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
obama is 100% right. and hes referring to ted cruz. obama will forever be my favorite president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stupid people should not be allowed to breed. Ted Cruz and all of the governors who are ruled by HATE and FEAR need to do some real soul searching. How did they get elected to lead anything? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey Ted Cruz NO CUBANS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN cuts and slices Ted Cruz response so the socialists and homosexuals could still exist within the fake doga of dialectics or the fake oldNazi dogma about a behavioral gene. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No asylum for muslims. Asylum for christians and yazidis they are low risk for our security. Who cares if its a betrayal of our values our values they dont exist anyway. Well done Ted Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz family were refugees. Not all Muslims believe in what has happened. Stop being ignorant to religion. There are some so called Christians that need to be deported! such as KIM DAVIS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Despite hiccups in foreign policy with Syria, Obama has been a great president. America OVERWHELMINGLY voted for him twice. What is an act of lunacy is Ted Cruzs campaign and his fantasy to become President. The country would never vote for a lying nutbag like him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WOW!!!! For once TED CRUZ said something SMART! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These governors have no choice. They cant say who comes and goes in their state and Ted Cruz can take his slimy ass back to Canada. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Every refugee who wants to come to our country should go through a month of tests. One of those tests will be monitoring their behavior when people make fun of their religion, and showing them different kind of acts that goes against their beliefs. If they fail to understand our country, fail to speak our language, and fail to behave like a good citizen, then theyre going back to where ever they came from. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Republican policy created this mess. Now they criticize the President for not being a complete war monger. just be thankful Ted Cruz isnt in charge <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz has an audiographic memory. When he hears something he can, at any time, recite it back exactly as he heard it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not funny in the least or news worthy. He looks just like the character he was imitating. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

just in case everyone doesnt understand what Marco Rubio is doing he is intentionally muddying the waters to make it tougher for the voting constituencies to be able to tell the difference between himself and Ted Cruz but as I said we all know whos the conservative and who is the liberal Republican Marco Rubio is jeb Bushs boy hes his conservative blocker <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Marco Rubio is a liar and a moderate Republican at best I think we all know the true conservative its Ted Cruz Ted Cruz 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
once again CNN you have failed to surprise me by having a liberal Democrat like good old rat face. Rat face will be a big fan of Marco Rubio the reason she is a supporter of Hillary Clinton she knows that Marco Rubio will be easily beaten by Hillary Clinton Ted Cruz will be much much tougher for Hillary to beat so she will support Marco Rubio as the easier candidate to be and suggests that Ted Cruz is a crazy whack job whos going to kill us all <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rubio in Cruz agree on legal immigration. also Rubio seeing the mood of the voter is trying to be more like Cruz not the other way around Rubio is the new standard bearer for the moderates now that Jeb Bush is no longer viable as a presidential candidate. the truth is if you want to Linguinis find moderate to liberal Republican Marco Rubios your man if you want a hardcore real conservative Ted Cruz your man Ted Cruz 2016 Ted Cruz.

Ted Cruz.... He is the only republican candidate who has argued cases in front of the Supreme Court and who has truly led the fight within Congress..

Mr. Ted Cruz you are threading religious leader of over 300 million population, some one with hundreds of billions of dollars in his pocket and owning over 30,000 private trained soldier.

Look at all these ignorant Americans. Ted Cruz is a puppet, not a conservative. War mongering politicians...

Ted Cruz is a real Latino. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
how come no matter how many good ideas conservative politicians have, liberals, news media, and talk show hosts including Colbert hound on the fact that they are against gay marriage. Its a deep rooted religious belief people! and Ted Cruz is right! Courts cannot and should not make laws. I dont favor gay marriage, but I wont stand against it either if certain states favor it. So why not just let each individual states decide whether they want to adopt gay marriage or not <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz secretly craves cock. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not surprised Colbert would let a guy like Cruz talk like that. As a highly religious man himself, I wouldnt be surprised if he agrees with Ted hence the stopping of the boos. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

So the problem isnt the ever increasing intolerance of the left and how so many are inclined to deny a voice to those with differing opinions? Well, thats a relief. Nope, the problem is that some people have the wrong opinions so all they have to do is get the right opinions and they can talk all they want. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Regardless I am not republican or Democrat both partys are sale outs.Thats why I will vote for Ted Cruz, go get your Clinton signs I bet thats who your voting for right.

I cant imagine how uneducated the average american must be that this clown is even taken seriously.

Then again, I thought Palin was that bottom and maybe they go ahead and nominate someone even less qualified and immoral next year, but I cant actually think of anybody. Now Im expecting either Snooki or Kanye West for 2020. And Im not even sure they could be worse. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mildred Grossman. Dear woman Pull your head out of your ass, Bush won both elections. He ran against a couple of morons , one just helped Obamas communist ass get a deal with Iran. Stupidest deal ever ,they are chanting death to America and these morons let them have nuclear weapons thats what there after. The other jackass couldnt even win his home state of Tennessee.

I never liked Ted Cruz too much, but I like him better for not dumping on Trump. Trump was dismissing McCain as a nobody, not disrespecting him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is too right wing and religious and stupid to be any where hear politcian He should be preach I would listen to him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Ted cruz is doing the exact right thing. The Republican Party has or at least used to have a sort of arbitrary and unwritten rule The party is very diverse and large, and in order to show unity they believed in what is known as The 11th Commandment. Basically, a Republican shouldnt ever bash another Republican, which is what Cruz refuses to do. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Maybe Ted Cruz doesnt want to get into the fray. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Having Donald Trump at the top of the GOP polls proves yet again the lunacy of the American rightwing. Theres no mystery why Trump is popular among the GOP. He, along with Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachman, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, etc. appeal to the kentucky fried Amuuurican voter who doesnt care about anything other than lower brainstem politics. Shallow politicians will always be loved by shallow voters. TrumpPalin 2016! GO AMUUUURICA!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz is a weasel lol. Hes hoping to take Trumps supporters after Trump drops out of the race. If that doesnt go through he wants to be VP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ad hominem, argumentum ad populum and Tu quoque. But I understand why theyre trying to demonize Senator Cruz. Hes intelligent, articulate and most of the time dead on correct.

Hey teabaggers Lead birther Ted Cruz was actually born outside the country in Canada. By the very same logic he the teabagger birthers falsely used against Hawaii born Obama, Ted Cruz would be ineligible for the presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its not likely that the majority of Republicans are as stupid as they seem. Much more plausible would be to simply assume they are liars. Just take everything they say and give their claims a 180 degree turn, and you have what they actually believe to be true. Try my theory with John Boehner or Ted Cruz, and youll see Ive come up with a very easy to use decoder. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

As long as at least one of his parents was a US citizen it does not matter where Obama was born. Canadian born Ted Cruz with his Cuban father has proved that by entering the 2016 Presidential race.

Do Americans actually vote for imbeciles like this ! Hilarious ! Frightening though ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The problem is people are too black, or white not a racial thing. People are either all the guns, or no guns, or all the churches, or no churches. Although, Huckaby is just pulling this stuff out of his ass Just like Ted Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Harry Reid you are a bad motherfucker in a good way. We need more strong Dems in the Senate. To fight republican obstructionism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In reality, Peter King is a typical political hack who feels threatened just as the Democrats do that Ted Cruz will reign in the accountability in Washington, and employ brilliant ideas, just as he did at Harvard Law, where he graduated top of his class. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How can one trust a man who, as President of the United States, looked directly into a nationally broadcasted camera and lied, multiple times? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thats right Ted Cruz is fucking up the Republican Party! Get this clown out of here! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whats worse than a FemiNazi like Hilary Clinton? A RepubliCUNT like Ted Cruz! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope Ted Cruz is the republican nominee... That means Hillary Clinton will DEFINITELY be President in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz puts money above principal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is a hypocrite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You can see the savagery.. the aggression.. its amazing. This truly is like when you see those videos of a tourist at the zoo falling into the chimpanzee enclosure. Does anybody, black, white, or hispanic not see this as being deplorable behavior? This will continue to happen as long as the liberal media keeps manipulating simple minded minorities. Please dear god sir, take another bus to work and back. Its not worth it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He finally did something i like... retire. Oh one more thing Ted Cruz 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is applying for Obamacare. Heres a real laugh when the parasite Cruz whines and bleats about free healthcare but now wants to leech off of it. Cruz is a lying, stupid piece of shit. I hope that he is denied. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this will empower the GOP.. the party of terrorists who hate americans... We will see funds taken out of health care, police enforcement, every govt dept and push it all into funding Dept of Defense and making contracts to sell weapons to pakistan. need someone who just says NO to anything the GOP does... otherwise here come the high gas prices, higher cost of living, stock market crash as privatized companies take over publicly traded, etc etc etc. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well Ill jump off that bridge when we come to it, endorcment. TED CRUZ FOR PRESIDENT. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz going on Obamacare, you mean after the republicans all railed against it since its inception. Hopefully this shows how not just Ted Cruz but all republicans have no business in office. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz for President! #tedcruz2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Well looky here aint it Mr Ted Repeal Obamacare Cruz?!?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz you flip floppidy lil backwards bitch! Go Home <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cruz is signing up for coverage through his employer, which just happens to be the Federal Government. He is not enrolled in Obamacare, which is a mandated single insurance coverage through a forced tax charge that you can receive qualified subsidies through your state enrollment system, and you would not enroll into if you have an employment option available to you. This is very different than Obamacare, and the fact that a journalist doesnt know that is shocking. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz should have expected people would think the worst of his actions even if he went on Obamacare to be noble, to be on the same healthcare as the everyday American. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Most Americans would die rather than embrace something that they consider a threat to their liberty. Not Ted Cruz. He needs his flu shot or he might get sniffly! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Most Americans would die rather than embrace something that they consider a threat to their liberty. Not Ted Cruz. He needs his governmentsubsidized flu shot or he might get sniffley! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz moonlights as a Drill Bit on Oil Rigs. Hes the King of the Dirty Spin. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LOL, TED CRUZ LASTED A WHOLE 3 DAYS IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. ITS OVER TEDDY <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When you have a family, and you have no health coverage then the responsible thing would be to provide a health plan, even if it is Obama care! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why ted cruz obama care sucks <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, I wasnt sure if I should support Ted Cruz or not... but since Peter King is against Ted Cruz, I guess that means I should support Ted Cruz since Peter King is probably the worst person in the world.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
.................................................ANOTHER .................................................................... ...................................TED CRUZ HYPOCRITE ALERT !!............................................... ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TEABAGGERS SUCK ASS ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is confusing....I dont know much but what I do know is that Ted Cruz wanted to defund and repeal obamacare. now he is signing up...he just lost my vote. we dont need a bipolar president, . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz receives coverage from the very same healthcare law which he shut the federal govt down to repeal? Its like hypocrisy is a fundamental principle of the modern GOP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Cruz had not obtained 0bamacare insurance and had opted not to have insurance and payed the fine, liberals would have taken his children away for neglect and abuse, and then thrown him in jail. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LOL, CNN thinks its a choice. Obama care is a mandate not a choice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Obamacare is such a disaster why did Ted Cruz sign up for Obamacare. What a hypocrite <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is an incredible douche <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a politician, the obamacare law says Ted cruz has a free subsidies even if he opposed it. If you are an average Joes then you will have to pay for it, the penalties and insurance to get covered. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Millions of Americans refuse to enroll in Obamacare because they do not want to be traitors, law or not. Shame on you Ted Cruz, I know longer support you even a little bit. Rand Paul 2016 full steam ahead! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Millions of Americans will not enroll in obamacare because they refuse to be traitors and you are enrolling in it? WOW. Sorry Ted you done fucked up. I roll back my even slight support of you. Rand Paul 2016 full steam! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
O my god, this is such a nonstory that its going to give me an aneurysm.

Ted Cruz A bumbling, stumbling, blowhard theatrics, all rhetoric, and completely devoid of any meaningful substance. Exactly what the GOP must avoid if we are to have any hope of defeating Hillary in 2016. We must nominate a serious candidate, not an incompetent Tea Party sideshow. turnwp20150209tedcruzneedsbetteranswers <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is an amazing guy. His views on the 2nd amendment and he fights for what he believes in. So big deal hes on Obamacare for his family for the time being. If there wasnt Obama care he would be on another government offered program from the Senate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is receiving coverage from the very same healthcare law that he shut the govt down to repeal. Republicans are professional hypocrites. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You guys need to stop watching CNN and start watching real news like fox, the blaze...CNN and MSNBC are a joke!! ITS THE LAW PPL!!! And hes not taking any subsidies!!! hasanewcustomertedcruz <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This guy is a joke. He built his career by attacking Obamacare. Now, the hypocrite is on Obamacare. Smh. Also, that dude was not even born in America. Will the birthers go after him like they did Obama? I doubt it. #whiteprivilege <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is such an Idiot, If this is what Republicans have to offer? This is just ridiculous, these folks secretly admire Obama <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

TED CRUZ IS RUNNING? .. This is going to be an interesting canadian election cycle. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I just dont know about Ted Cruz. I like Rand Paul he stood up against the National Defense Authorization Act Obama singed in 2011 on New Years Eve, the Patriot Act, against the NSA spying program which violates 4th amendment rights, stood up for the 2nd amendment rights the right to bare arms, stood up against giving Mohammad Morsi an ex muslim brotherhood leader who was president of Egypt but was ousted later billions of dollars in American aid, F16s and Abram tanks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this fucker needs to get shot <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like how he talks to her like shes the stupid one lol the irony <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If he doesnt sign up for healthcare via his job he would have been fined and he simply stated he was following the law until its repealed! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz doesnt have a long track record yet of standing up and fighting for many issues America faced in the past to prove himself trustworthy in leading America and the American people in the right direction as President of the United States. Only two years and some months as Senator and rumors he was born in Canada. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz cant be US president legally because he was born in Canada. If he gives up his Canadian citizenship, he still cant run for US president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We have tried all others whove said they know how to fix America and they have failed. The bipartisan establishment and and out of touch Cenkbot like president Obama. Its we someone who strives to be like the founding fathers a shot, someone like Rand Paul or Ted Cruz. We owe it to our country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

God Bless Ted Cruz and for the future of America and the whole world Vote for the right person <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ted cruz is a canadian <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Where are the birthers? Show us you didnt waste your time on Obama. We have a foreigner running. His name is Ted Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How can he run, he was born in Canada. He wont win either way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz was born in Canada so he legally cant be US president or US vice president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow Ted Cruz is a complete dickhead. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I understand we shouldnt always vote Dem but to say to vote Rep? He has to be a fuckin idiot. Dems are just the lesser of the two evils. Dont say vote Rep, say we need more options dickhead. Obviously the GOP paid you off to become one of their House Negros aka bottom bitch. Any Black person that follows your ignorant rhetoric deserves exactly what the outcome will be. How about we look at more independent Candidates instead? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if Ted Cruz suggested this idea it would be considered racist by liberals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ha ha, Marco Rubio is a joke,not as big a joke as Ted Cruz, but a funny joke none the less. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Jeb is our next president. Hillary will crack under the pressure of media before the primaries, then theyll bring in Warren. They might as well bring Ted Cruz if they bring Warren in, theyd have as good of a chance. Jeb will win it, just watch. He dont need a translator to speak to Hispanics, who are a conservative and traditional people by large. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I find it hard for techies such as engineers like myself to agree with this man. I feel like hes missed the whole point of net neutrality. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz for President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow. 2 months into power and the Republican leadership has consisted of fighting over DHS funding, using snowballs to disprove climate change, inviting a Prime Minister to bash the President, and now this. These next 2 years are going to be fun! I just know it! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is history now. I knew he didnt have a backbone. TED CRUZ 2016!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The saddest part about this is not that he thinks he can get the GOP nomination but the fact that hes a doctor! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is an unlikable jerkoff. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The big takeaway from those results is that those five only represent 78% of the votes. Where are the other 22%? They are SOOOO fractured! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whee! The circle jerk has begun! Who will lead the next tone deaf charge for the White House? Will it be Jeb George the Third Bush? Chris lets make a traffic jam Christie? Ted not quite Tom Cruz? Scott the jobs are here you just cant see them Walker? And what will they do when Hillary loses her presidential bid again, just like she always has? Swipes against Hillary and talk of action without substance seem to be all theyve got without her, theyve got nothing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rafael Edward Ted Cruz is the shiftiest looking politician I have ever seen. He also seems to be a complete moron, as well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz wasnt born in the USA! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary Clinton has absolutely alienated the Democratic base. Shes thoroughly corrupt and I could not bring myself to vote for her, no matter how bad the Republican candidate is. I will not be a party to choosing between the likes of Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, one of the few intelligent comments that has come out of Michelle Bachmans mouth. Christ that woman is stupid. Clinton should be nervous. Shes a complete sellout and I want her in office about as much as I want Ted Cruz, perhaps one of the few politicians more corrupt than Hillary. Id love to see Warren in the White House. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rather Jeb then any of Tea party nuts like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This is why I hate CNN, theyll never discredit a dumb ass politician like Ted Cruz, who shut down the government last year and after 67 times of failing, is once again trying to appeal Obamacare. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I cant believe these people are talking so poorly of Ted Cruz. You helped spread the lies about Obamacare while Ted Cruz tried stop to it. Shame on you! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It doesnt even matter who is more supported between Hillary and Warren, Ted Cruz or Rand Paul would RAPE them both. Figuratively speaking of course. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im 18 and I just voted Republican. The economy, taxes, and immigration are important, but the main reasons I went conservative were abortion and gay marriage. Im avidly against both. Please, Republicans dont let me down! Do what you can while you have the majority! I know youre checking out these comments or at least youd better be if you value the younger voters. Like if youre prolife so this is seen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Omg these comments are fucking stupid.. You can be a leader and still have a sense of humor you dont always have to be uptight. And this country was run down before he got to office. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Shut up Ted Cruz and go back to canada <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I believe that title should say... AFT American Federation of Teachers, but who am I to correct a major news outlet like CNN? Anyway... the problem with the health care in the U.S. is NOT bc of partisan politics... its bc the gov took over and made a fixable problem worse. Really now... can anyone point out a where the gov came into any private business and made it better? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Nugent won this argument <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz for president. Honestly way better than Obama <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
when it was Democratic majority, we had economic growth and a functional government. Obama was able to get the funding he needed to jump start the economy, save the auto industry, and bailout banks. Republican House majority, we have government shutdown that cost the economy 22 Billion. Senator Ted Cruzs filibuster was 21 hours and 19 minutes. He was reading Green Eyes and Ham. We dont need this in Congress. Nowadays nothing gets done. Wake up people! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz sounding like a typical asshole. Afraid to tell it like it is. We have laws and borders . Dont come here illegally or we will send you back. Stay the hell out if you cant do it the right way. Stop pussy footing around Ted. We dont need another fag Republican Thats not going to get people who oppose Fag Democrats to come out and vote . Wake up fag politicians. Wake up and speak to real Americans. God, Im sick of these assholes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why didnt they just call him a Ni3r and got it over with. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Say hello to the next President of the United States. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Youre right... We wont forget that last summer you were funding ISIS, and giving them weapons. You also wanted to act as their air force. We wont forget that McCain was hanging out with them. We wont forget that you assholes have all those Christians blood on your hands. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets not forget Jebs brother double the national debt with deficits which was 6.1 trillion. George W. Bush holds the most debt by any president in history more so than Barack Obama to this day. Jeb Bush is no conservative and Ted Cruz is cool, but Rand Paul would be the most conservative candidate for the 2016 presidential primaries. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Must break the hearts of some liberals and blacks to see the changing face of the South! Nikki Haley and Tim Scott in SC, Bobby Jindal in LA, Marco Rubio in FL and Ted Cruz in TX to name a few. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The people who elected Ted Cruz will never win a game of scrabble. Sarah Palin, Rick Perry, Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, and Ted Cruz should not be allowed to breed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I genuinely think that unless Jesus Christ himself lept off the fucking cross to lead your country, Americans wouldnt be happy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Hillary Clinton or Rand Paul end up as President we are screwed !!! They dont stand for anything ! They go with the flow and say what people want to hear. What amazes me are the people that dont see that ! President Obama dont go ! I love you. You saved America ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please Hillary, dont mend! You just focus yourself for election 2016. Your gonna be the next President!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ONE thing Ted Cruz is wrong about... Obama DOES Understand how Radical the terrorists are...... HE IS HELPING THEM AND AGREES WITH THEM!! ALSO, What in the hell does Ted Cruz mean they are arming SOME of the Rebels in Syria? They are arming ALL OF THEM!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Paul screwed the pooch with his support for amnesty. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For fucks sake, get of your ass and find something better to do than HURT your county! Didnt republicans say they are for the US? This is a waste of time, waste of tax money, and just pointless. Crisis is all over the world, dont do this, I have lost virtually the last shred of respect for republicans. They are holding this country back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im glad that we voted him in twice! That almost makes up for 12 years of Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I generally disagree with Ted Cruz, but here I agree. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is a Zionist tool. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The GOP will do what they always do. Complain, do nothing and then blame Obama if he does something or if he doesnt do something. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A bad photo opt? What? So, hes more concerned about taking pictures than taken care of the citizens who live in Texas! POS <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why are you listening to Ted Cruz? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only thing he did was defending someones right of prejudice which is kinda fair, but weve never seen Rand Paul mention anything about people other than poverty is tough love. The only person in Congress whos done the most for the people is Bernie Sanders. If someone can point out anything Rand Paul did for minorities and the LGBT community Ill eat my words, but as far as Im concerned the Pauls say anything just to get a vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why are Obama supporters so dumb and lazy? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really really hope a Republican comes in and just destroy this fucking country just so I could say miss Obama yet <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Gotta love Ted. Left wing nut jobs hate him because he exposes their corrupt, tyrannical and foolish leaders who want to control every aspect of our lives. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul and Ted Cruz for 2016 lets get Americas pride back that obama has thrown away lets get our economy back that obama has destroyed and lets repeal obamacare that caused millions of Americans to loose their health insurance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The problem with spoken language is whats in parenthesis often goes unheard what he meant was Ted Cruz is a very intelligent guy for a Texas republican. That doesnt say much. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is so far right of the Republican Party, ie the Tea Party, which is not the majority of the Republican Party, and will certainly turn off Independents. So, go ahead a run Ted, Suess, Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes running to be the MOST CONSERVATIVE? How about the MOST RACIST? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is a douche horse <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im so happy this is on the record. Hopefully we can put a progun canidate like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul up against her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
There needs to be a committee to investigate whether Ted Cruz has ever molested donkeys or not. We owe it to the donkeys <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahaha, oh laugh it up Piers. What is even funnier is that no one outside of the student audience, watched your show. Hahahaha, your show is canceled because it sucked. Piers took the highest rated CNN show in history and ran it into the ground, then got fired for it. That is funnier than the Ted Cruz crack. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz has a face you just want to shred off with a grinder. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bill Clinton is a CIA scumbag criminal. Him attacking Ted Cruz is a compliment to Ted Cruz. The leadership of both parties are run by the same people. Most of the Republicans are controlled andor blackmailed into shutting up and doing as theyre told. It takes a lot of guts for people like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul to stand in the face of the corporate controlling elite that run the system. #infowars <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One thing seems odd to me. They never once tear up, not even a bit. My father died and for the better part of a year, if I thought of him, and tried to talk about him, Id tear up. Very strange. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol. Ted Cruz. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz stated on television CSpan that the senate should have another 49 Jesse Helms in the senate a racist, sexist, adulterer, rapist who forced a black woman to have his love child. Good going so called man of god the lesser godSatan. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bob Dole is right. We need to stop having garbage cans like Ted Cruz if the republican party wants to be a national party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
NO, you NEOCONS are the extreme right wing. I dont know what Ted Cruz is yet but he is still pretty brainwashed by the NWO... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is on crazy rightwing Canadian. That is for sure. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is what Bob Dole would say about his opinion of Ted Cruz Bob Dole doesnt like Ted Cruz <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I find it very entertaining when loony leftists like Bob Dolt get their panties in a wad and spew their verbal menstruation when real Americans object to their evil ruling class way of life. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clinton you old whoremonger hillbilly bastard! Had Ted Cruz been around when you had your impeachment trial he would of made a big monkey out of you! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz should absolutely not be criticizing or working on AMERICAN policies when first of all, he is CANADIAN. If he so badly worries about conservative views and immigration, why doesnt he go back to Canada, control its borders before judging anybody else. Hypocrite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted cruz is an illegal immigrant! kick him out! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How about Ted Cruz do something to improve the U.S. instead of just campaigning. He has done nothing but hurt this Country. Why would you think he would do any different if he was in a higher position in the Government. He wouldnt. He is a cancer...brought to you by a Texan. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Ted Cruz became House Leader ABSOLUTELY nothing would get done. If you thought Congress was bad before... think again. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Ted Cruz! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz is the only potential presidential candidate with enough balls and brains to lead this country. With his connection to Cuba, he understands what communism is all about and how evil it is.

EXCELLENT JOB Sen. Ted Cruz! You are one of the many reasons why the United States of America is an AMAZING and still IS the GREATEST, MOST POWERFUL, FIRST WORLD COUNTRY and NATION ON EARTH...

Let say the tea party says that Obama has violated American law and the Constitution through Obamacare. They surround the White House. They throw fire bombs at the White House security guard.

Yea the system is corrupt and looks out only for corporate interests, but you dont give all the power to this narcissist, anti science, cultish, slimy snake Cruz.

Rubio is the only one that can go against Hillary. Who else? Trump? Sleepy Carson? Ted Cruz was a master debater back in his college days so maybe he can do something. Cmon splash your face with some cold water and look at reality. Dont hand over the Presidency to Hillary in a silver platter with Trump and Zzz Carson. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Most of the American people support this woman clerk. Im one of them. The filthy homos never won the votes from the American people with paper trails like PH8 as We the People. This was forced by communist judges and twisting the Constitution for filthy homo marriage. Supreme Judges should be impeached by being communists and bring damnation to America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ted Cruz is one of the most revolting creatures if not the most revolting creature to have come along in ages, and when you think of the scum in living memory, thats saying something!

The economy has recovered slightly BECAUSE congress has prevented Obama from doing anything. Everything he has done has stopped the economy from doing better Keystone, Obamacare, paying for illegal immigrants and an immigration law hes refusing to follow. Do Nothing Congress actually works because it stops Obama. Obama wants compromise but doesnt know how the people voted to give him less leverage. Hasnt he noticed that?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is Ted Cruz, A secret agent for Canada to close the Govt. an privatize the govt to be run by considerations. Holy Shit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
