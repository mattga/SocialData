Trump 2016 !!! bernie sanders is to old to be president <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Can Mr. Trump beat Hillary in 2016? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No mention of Bernie sanders??? Smh not surprised <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
@CNN, Why are you guys not reporting about Bernie Sanders? Bernie Sanders is the Candidate worth voting for, while Donald Trump is the New Hitler of the 21st Century and hes not a presidential Material... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Though I support Bernie Sanders, I would rather have Trump than Cruz in the White House. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
im scared to post this comment cuz of the hate im probably gonna get but id love for bernie sanders to win. he is doing pretty damn well too, as the last ive heard tho. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie thinks black THUGS lives matter? Fuck him! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its been confirmed that CNN has been propagating proHillary narratives with deleting proBernie comments and disregarding their own polls when they wouldnt support Hillary. With that knowledge in mind, its obvious to me that theres some malicious edits going on here. Throughout the interview Bernie seems erratic and there are times where they cut off his sentences. #BernieSanders2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would trust Senator Bernie Sanders for light years ahead over Clintons constantly in heat sleazy husband! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Bernie Sanders would be a better president than Trump and Clinton combined. Sanders shows that he really wants this opportunity, doesnt show hate towards other candidates, and cares for what people want in this world. If Trump or Clinton wins, theyll be happy and not know what to do. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would actually vote Trump over Cruz. Never thought a day would come that I said Id vote for Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow, packed house, Cruz. Im sure your definitely giving Bernie Sanders a run for his money with the crowds you draw. oh wait, I forgot. you dont need those people. your sugar daddy millionaire and billionaire donors with your super PACs will take care of everything for you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN pushing for Cruz to become the Republican candidate and has zero chance of beating Hilary Clinton <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Are the democrats even running for president? ... last i heard was that Bernie is fighting global warming, and Hillary is still deleting emails <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if only bernie could win this <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look I get it, hes an arrogant, selfish, asshole. But he isnt a bad politican. The Media wants to bring him down using that against him. Its sad we vote for such people. There are so many candidates out there who can save America from where it is now, but no, we have to vote for Hillary, or Bernie, or Trump. Pick someone who isnt retarded or way in over their head, such as Ben Carson or Rand Paul. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Climate Change the BIGGEST FRAUD of the 21st century. Im not buying it, whether its the Pope or Obama or the UN Secretary General trying to sell me the myth, I will never budge. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

911 was an inside job. The Bush family, the Saudis, the Zionist all knew years in advance that the towers would come down on 911. They are traitors to humanity. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If you thought Obama was bad, just imagine if old nutty Bernie became president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders is only down by 69 points in Iowa and leads by at least 7 in New Hampshire at the end of November. So my question is how do the Dems already have a nominee? They dont. Sanders can really make things interesting if he wins in Iowa and New Hampshire. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Lol.......Someones setting Trump up for a rude awakening on election night. Im excited to see his ego get deflated lol.......BTW is that Omarosa?? Can this be anymore staged??

wow, 51% black youth unemployment? if he just listened to Bernie Sanders years ago he would have already known that <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love how trump is quoting bernie sanders unemployment findings on black youth. trump must be scared shitless to resort to Hilarys strategy of coping sanders test. pathetic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lol this is a joke. No black person wants to work. U heard him say 51% but they still vote democrat every single election. When election time comes they will vote bernie for more free handouts <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

So many far lefties and right wing nuts commenting in videos like this, where one politician comments on another. I guess I would have to take Bill Mahers advice and side with the far lefties and cranks just to get Bernie elected. The means to the ends are justified.

I believe in everything Bernie says about gun control besides banning assault weapons we hunt with vermin hunt with ARs and AKs and Ill tell you it makes it much easier then hunting coyotes, wild hogs, and even other prey animals much safer.

LOL, having a person called Killer will get you those votes you need to win LOL. Bernie is not too smart <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sanders is atheist and socialist. Only 48% of americans would vote for him. The only way he could win is if the democrat coalition turnout outperform the levels of 2008 and 2012. As a conservative, I apreciate Sanders as person, he really believe in his cause, unlike Hillary. I cheer he gets the nomination because it would be a gift to the GOP candidate. Rubio, Kasich, Jeb and Christie would not feel any burn. Trump or Cruz coul get burned. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders said In fact climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Interrupt Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton, they allow you to voice your concerns and speaks with you directly. The End result no more interruptions at their rallies. Interrupt Trump, his attack dogs jump you. The End result MORE INTERRUPTIONS AT OTHER TRUMP RALLIES!!!! Trump, you dumb piece of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Idiot trump fanboys incoming!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is correct. Saying ISIS represents all Muslims is like saying Hitler and the KKK represent all Christians. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

that disgusting diseased old man takes swipes at trump because his polls are failing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie playing down the Mooslim threat..... ISIS beheading Christians and generally running wild and ongoing terrorism with the most recent example being Paris but Trump is scapegoating Muslims.....This Bernie Sanders is one seriously creepy individual..... TRUMP 2016! BECAUSE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS SUCKS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
my man Bernie. you got my vote for saying the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hell this idiot blames Change for world wide terrorism. And I guarantee you one thing this fool will gut the national defense budget in favor of Social welfare for rich kids, dead beats and foreigners <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You know what is going to happen i bernie sanders gets elected? Nothing. Hes like another obama, he gives a free good libtard speeches, gets elected, does nothing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FEEL THE BERN <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie sanders is so ignorant he said climate change caused the Paris attacks this even makes him more of a ignorant person <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is a milder version of Hillary and Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
FUCK TRUMP,VOTE BERNIE SANDERS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To think millions of athome 20 year olds are going to vote for this commie.What the fuck happened America? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
youre absolutely right bernie. trumps strategy is to win votes by pandering to everyones fear. so he endorses every memes he likes, say yes to any question asked. right now, if you ask him do u gobble? hed say absolutely, I have a fantastic gobble <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
its people like trump that probably advocate stuff like right to bear arms, dear Mr trump would you support Syrian refugees or the millions of law abiding Muslim citizens having the right to bare arms? something tells me that you would oppose minorities having access to a lot of guns but you still want it spread amongst your Republican hunting party <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a black man i love that they threw that idiot out, stupid clown. You wont go out and vote and sit on your lazy ass but then whine and disrupt bernie sanders and hillary clinton the people who actually give a damn? Im glad trump threw them out and i encourage him to continue to do so until these fools learn. Next time dont sit on your lazy ass in the election period. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN obviously hired these people , what a convenience theyre now interviewing the protester. If CNN is going this far to smear Donald Trump then it will only motivate more people to vote for Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Didnt seem like he mattered that much to me... i also didnt see a punch thrown they removed an unruly guest physically but to say he got beat up is ubsurd the term for what happened to this guy who does not matter as much as he thought was bounced he got bounced from the trump club maybe he should go to a bernie sanders rally since bernie sanders an angry old white man is the face of his party after the muslim n chief leaves office <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WOW , CNN keeps editing Trump comments. He never said anything about MUSLIMS , he said that some people in new Jersey which has a large Arab population cheered. You people should be fired from your jobs , this isnt even journalism anymore.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Isnt the thing he said about being the only person to stand against the war in iraq total bollocks? Bernie Sanders completely opposed it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not sure about New Jersey......but I DO remember watching some muslims in Michigan who were cheering after the 911 attacks. I remember it angered a lot of people and even broke into a fight. CNN shut the fuck up please. You never covered Hillary lying about coming under sniper fore in Bosnia. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Trump says it enough times its gonna be true. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lock Trump up for hate speeches and national socialism. This guy is insane and this type of racism should not be in a presidential run. This isnt even freedom of speech of speech anymore when hes giving followers wrong information to hate on a certain minority. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Did he say Bernie Sandals? XD <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id love to see the day Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump can debate against each other for the presidential ballot. I dont agree with most of what Donald says, but his initiative for presidency isnt SuperPak based cause hes REALLY rich lol, and are prioritized more around the concerns of their countrys citizens than most of their other party nominees. Bernie Sanders would most likely prevail in that discussion, but it would certainly be an interesting one. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bernie licking hillarys shoe, he lost in the polls after this <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Interrupt Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton, they allow you to voice your concerns and speaks with you directly. The End result no more interruptions at their rallies. Interrupt Trump, his attack dogs jump you. The End result MORE INTERRUPTIONS AT OTHER TRUMP RALLIES!!!! Trump if you dont want hecklers speak with them directly like actual human beings you dumb piece of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE GAS PIPELINES HILLARY GOT A 500,000 NECKLACE FROM A PRINCE IN QATAR. BERNIE OR FUCK YOU <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hopefully the protester will know next time, not to interrupt a Trump speech anymore. Im sure that Hillary or Bernie would welcome him, and even give him their microphones...LOL <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Those Black Lives Matter Hoodrats can do this shit with Bernie Sanders and Hillary but that shit wont fly with Trump. Get over it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump has successfully alienated 100% of every ethnic minority in the US. Which means no less than 30% of the US is not going to vote for him which in turn means he has to get about 75% of white Christians to vote for him to win the presidency. Which isnt going to happen so its a slam dunk for the Democrats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN, Communist News Network trying to slander the Donald. Next time should Trump walk off the stage like a wimp, and let that maniac call his audience white racists? Pathetic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would like to take a shit on Donalds face... In protest. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump did point out Bernies biggest weakness, that he lacks of power. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Somehow, I get the feeling he wont survive prison. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I called it, I told you so. Check the CNN video of when the BLM queens disrespected and interrupted Bernie Sanders when they went on a hyena attack and completely chimped out I said in the comments section that they wouldnt be able to pull that off in a Trump rally. I was proven correct. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That dude tried his nonsense at the wrong rally. Hed have much better luck at the Bernie, or Hillary speeches next time. They would probably just give him their microphone, and let him take over. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BLM mightve gotten away with it on Bernie and Hillary, but the Donald wont put up with this shit and his supporters are no pushovers either. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That coward Bernie Sanders could learn a thing or two from Trump. THIS is how you LEAD. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Our Liberal agenda 1 Bernie Sanders 2 Hillary Clinton 3 Donald Trump He would be such a colossal fuck job, the RepubTeaBaggers will be a done deal finally! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Dear Americans... Without you knowing it, the whole world Europe, SouthAmerica, the MiddleEast and Asia begs you to vote for Bernie Sanders. He gets more media attention in all other countires then in your own. How can your candidates be people like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump? Why more lies, why more war, why so blind!?

I was born and grew up in the Soviet Union. Russians tried socialism. It did not work. It brought hunger and repressions. Government promisses free stuff to get power.

Before I watch the video Let me guess, this video is only going to fact check Bernie Sanders and not Hillary Clinton. After I watched the video Yup I was right hahaha what a surprise. CNN not holding Hillary to scrutiny what a surprise considering the fact that CNN is the same organization that deleted its own poll after the first Democrat debate which showed overwhelmingly that Bernie Sanders won. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary is the clear winner of this debate. She stood firm and resolute while Bernie Sanders and the Unidentified Man never laid a hand on her. We can skip the voting now, and just move on to the general election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Guy on the right and guy on the left wants to villainize Wall Street, Wall Street isnt an issue at hand, by a damned sight, hasnt been for 7 years, Bernie... I do not trust! Hillary can jumpstart Wall Street... these guys? DUMB. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders the next president of the United States of America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clinton is nothing more than a corporate hack. She will say anything to get elected, because she has a record to taking corporate money and Bernie does not. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It doesnt matter if you give 1 or 2 million to a candidate. You are merely giving to receive a favor. People that donate to Bernie give because they want free healthcare and free education. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She had absolutely no viable response prepared whatsoever when Bernie Sanders called her out on her hundreds of millions earned in wall street campaign contributions. So what did she do? Completely change the subject and talk about her women voters and 911. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is more worried about global warming and taxing Americans at 92% than terrorism.. What a joke!!!!! He will never win a presidential election simply because he is an idiot!!!!!

Clinton doesnt have a mind. Bernie has a mind, but doesnt use it correctly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Theres a difference between running for president and being president.Bernie is just like Obama hes fooling everyone with an extreme promise of change that will never happen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He forgot to mention when the CIA and the British went into Iran and toppled the elected leader in the early 1950s and in his place they put in a ruthless dictator so a few oil company billionaires could continue to get oil from Iran. If Iran detonates a nuke here in America this is the reason why. Its mostly the fault of a few American billionaires who own our government officials. This is why Im voting for Bernie Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie voted to keep funding the war in Iraq....he is a career polititian. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Comrad Bernie pull the cotton out of your nose i cant understand a damn word you say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THIS JUST IN You didnt need Bernie Sanders to impune your integrity, H.Cunton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stop fucking your shit up cnn , Bernie 2016 , also provide real facts about the curuption in the world. What happened to the ex CIA FBI rep video on the interview Friday that exposed a big part of bs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THE HILLARY CLINTON STRATEGY 1. Raise as much money as possible 2. Bank on the fact that you are woman and constantly talk about your female relatives. 3. Hope that people will vote for you just because you have a D next to your well known name. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Democrats are being held hostage by literally every activist group out there. For that reason, youre never gonna get the real Hillary Clinton, or the real Bernie Sanders. Its a complete waste of time to watch the debates or follow them on the campaign trail. Politics aside, Hillary always looks amazing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BERNIE BERNIE BERNIE!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Not nearly enough time in a 147 video to fact check Clinton, huh? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This woman is as dirty as any republican. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ugh ...Hillary makes me want to vomit. Her pathetic attacks on Bernie are downright laughable <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
that was a bad answer, 911 had nothing to do with wall street and its role in the financial crisis of 08 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THAT WAS A CHEAP SHOT FROM THAT OLD MAN, WHATS HIS NAME? OH YES... BERNIE!! BUT IT DID NOT WORK!!! SHE WAS NOT BORN YESTERDAY AND SHE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED BY ANY ASSHOLE!!!

lol. completely changed the topic. bernie is the only non corporate whore in EITHER party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ill tell you why I wont support Hillary. Because Bernie is the only person talking about Citizens United and campaign finance reform. This is the biggest threat to our democracy in my opinion, and we need to act soon. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary is a Republican in Democratic clothing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if you clinton fans aka nonsensical feminists think that that was a good rebuttle, then I am not surprised women are stupid and female feminists are even more stupid. Atheist dogs! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie looks like the crap I just took Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everything about hilarity is Republican. She is a Democrat just because she was married to a Democrat. Bernie 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clinton is speaking absolute nonsense. Theres no way Wall Street is gonna donate to her campaign and then expect to get nothing out of it. Thats bullshit. Dont insult our intelligence. She is merely Obama 2.0. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey, good for you Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope we get bernie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq war, the vehicle that helped create ISIS. Nobody needs her sympathy, innocent people just shot down or maimed however they could make it happen. What is needed is solutions too the problems she helped create. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And 2 of them said they want to bring in 65,000 Syrians!!! An entire medium sized muslim city <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Democrats promote the policies that created these conditions that allowed the attacks. Open border policy, non deportation of illegal immigrants, sanctuary cities. Socialistcommunist Sanders is the biggest proponent of these policies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump is such a snake. Trying to take a jab at Carson in a half handed cheap way. Carson was being honest about what he was like as a child and how he was able to turn his life around. Trump is just tying to use carsons own words to his advantage, and acts like hes not a dirty dishonest politition. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I guess my live doesnt matter. FUCK YOU too Bernie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The only one worth a shit is Bernie Sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The guy is in melt down. He so desperate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders you white trash mental midgets. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Them some messy ass reporters. Dumb ass Donald did not compare Coon ass Carsons issue to child molestation, he compared consequences to people with issues. Basically saying how come he got to be phyco and has never been dealt with, while trying to run for president. But Donald is a hypocrite bc hes also a phyco without consequences. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald should be President 2016 but i think he needs to lay off Ben Carson, He is a Respectable Person. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im sad that republicans have acutally let trump go this far. BERNIE 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie just sealed his own fate!! And people laugh at Trump. Lol lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you think Trump isnt bought and paid for like the rest of them, including Bernie and the rest of the Replublicrats, then youre probably drooling a little out of the corner of your mouth right now and have to pull out a calculator for single digit addition. The movie Idiocracy is here........and in a surprise move Stone Cold Steve Austin enters the race and takes out Trump with a folding chair! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Donald Trump! Bernie 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a satire of himself. Carson seems burnt out inside. Hillary is the epitome of the self righteous bitch. All theres left is some elderly fellow by the name of Bernie, which is a blend of Bert Ernie. God bless America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OMG whats up with this guy i hope the ppl in America will understand that this is not what we want our country to look like. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The White House needs Bernie Sanders. Putting him in office will truly make America great. Rand Paul is pretty smart too but his chances are much lower so I guess its best to put Bernie against all the other clowns sellouts. From the UK, I hope Americans will make the better choice but unfortunately, most Americans are just idiots so itll be tough teaching the sheep to think before voting. Good luck. #FeelTheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders is an Independent that honestly CARES about the middle class of this great country of ours. Read up on him and just have an open mind. He puts the average American first <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

But at the interview they asked him about his favorite chapter, verse, old or new testament and couldnt answer, was too personal for the man that speaks his mind.. Bernie Sanders is the man! Trump is funny but also a lier, not presidential material. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And its Bernies kind who fuel these dangerous events such as Ferguson, just to create false beliefs and create chaos, even death. Then its Bernies kind who owns the media highlighting the events as something severe, spark racism. Im not sure who Bernies working for, but its nothing to do with bettering America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The media wont actually ever side with this guy, this is a sideline distraction for a few more months. The real issue is how CNN is running for Hillary and constantly denying Bernie Sanders justice. If Hillary wins youll see another bank bail out with your tax money, even if she blames other people or uses words other than a bail out, you absolutely will not see big cash fraud lead to a prison cell unless you get out and vote for Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bakari contradicts himself in that he says the world is becoming browner and Hillary is positioning her campaign for this.

Nobody calls Bernie a racist, theyre too busy stealing his microphone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Any concerned voter is not sick of hearing about Clintons emails. Bernie is doing some damage control for his political party. He knows the democrats have a slim chance in 2016 and Clintons emails are what caused it, so he tries to deflect attention away from it because Clinton was their only chance at having a Democrat in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary has received the Democratic party coronation, Mr.Bernie is just there as her spotting partner. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN NEVER REPORTED THIS. SURPRISE!!!! sanderssandrabland56201d82e4b06462a13b719d <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if the kid was a black would anyone been arrested... honestly probably not <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
When Bernie saw a wounded snake he tried to pat it on the head remember the email comments at the debate?. Now shes bitten him on the nuts hes crying foul. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Now they are truly FRIGHTENED. What a pleasure, lies and nonsense, I feel makes me feel good like I knew that it should. What was that some arsed burial rite for Bernie, the media are trying to make politics well ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. Bernie will win, people love him but hate you #FeeltheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Corporate Media talking heads imply that if Bernie Sanders states HRC facts, he has lowered his profile. Meanwhile Hillory Clinton has accused B.Sanders of racism and sexism talking heads dont mention that. CNN thinks Clinton has hit her stride . The irony. Jeez. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Theres no such thing as the race card!!! Its a phase causasians invented to get out of talking about race. As a result, minorities are discouraged to talk about their truth and what they deal with on a daily basis. If somethings affecting you, you have to talk about it!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary is playing both the race and gender cards, and on both counts, shes being cynical and disingenuous. When an interviewer asked her if she really believed Bernie was sexist, she smiled and said, Ive said all that I needed to say about that. This is a calculated political trick shes playing, and I dont expect Democratic strategist hacks like Bakari Sellers to call a spade a spade. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What?! Hillary called Bernie sexist because he said stop shouting about guns? Is that fucking real? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
SNL is arguably one of the most consistently unfunny shows on television. This one featuring Trump was no exeception.

Bakari Sellers, did you already find out, that Hillary Clinton has no racial justice platform? If CNN would invite a Bernie Sanders supporter to the panel, you would be looking ridiculous. But we all know, CNN is making sure, that thats not going to happen. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This man lacks emotions. Bernie is such a great dude. He let those ladies take over his mic bc he knew that what he was talking about struck a chord with them . imagine if u were attacked and targeted bc of your skin color... you wouldnt like it. Bernie is able to empathize with people, he has ideas for making a nation where all men are actually equal. And not just men, but women as well. #FeelTheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You might not agree with him, but everyone knows Bernie Sanders doesnt have a sexist or racist bones in his body. In fact, he might be the most honorable man in the race. If Mrs. Clintin is trying to misrepresent him by twisting his words, she has lost my respect. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If criticizing her record is not legit, then, Bernie might as well pack his bags and hand the nomination to Hillary. Of course, Bernie has to go after her record which is one of political expediency not of principles. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Israel is the root of a lot of unrest and extremism from the Middle East. Anybody who deals with them has to be very careful. It would help if Israel stop building settlements, but thats not going to happen because theres money to be made by Jews who want to move to Israel from other parts of the world. And with the settlements come money. Thus, there will always be issues. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Conservatives are angry at CNBC when really their anger should directed at the Republican party. The GOP made themselves look like the buffoons they are CNBC cant take credit for that. This is simply what happens when you put a bunch of obnoxious clowns up on stage. Admittedly CNBC didnt do a great job, but its corporate media, what do you expect? The debate was a total freak show and all of the candidates were bizarre and incoherent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie has been making the shouting comment for months about the two sides on gun control... it has NOTHING to do with gender, he makes this point about everyone.

As ever, Senator Sanders tries to steer the discussion back to the larger and more important issues and away from personal attacks on other candidates.

Look at the smug look on the reporters face at the end. You can almost see the distain he has for Bernie because his bosses are in his ear telling him to smear him then cut him off when he tries to talk about it. I wish Bernie would just call CNN out for being owned by time warner, the 7th largest campaign donor of Hillary. But he knows if he does that he wont be asked back on their program.

The media is simply ignoring what Bernie has been saying about NON ISSUES! Bernie clearly explained what he meant by what he said, and this moron it CNN after all keeps pushing for some bashing...smh. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, if this poll was done after Joe Bidens choice of not running for president, then these unexpected surge in numbers on the poll is explained by those who supported Biden, now will suport mostly Hillary, however, not all of those votes went to her, quite a big chunk went to Sanders campaign also, so the poll shows finally the real gap 11 points arent really that much this early on the race and now we can watch Bernie close the gap as the campaign develops. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernies audience doesnt look like the Democratic party?... Wtf does that mean? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is honest but weak he doesnt have a real plan to put his ideas into action He is like Obama <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie responded to that ludicrous question perfectly, treating it lightly but not in a dismissive way. As ever he retained his dignity and made the most of the moment by clearly explaining his own gun control policy.

If Rubio is elected president he might actually beat GWB in the number of days vacation he takes. GWB took a total of 879 days vacation. GWB, his first year in office, he took a month long vacation before 911. GWB was on vacation when Hurricane Katrina struck. This is what youre going to get with Rubio, Jeb Bush, and maybe Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton was back on the campaign trail the next day after her 11hour Benghazi testimony. Thats commitment.

Heres whats going to happen CNN either give Bernie Sanders the credit he deserves as he clearly won the debate OR have the real supporters of the REAL democratic nominee keep shitting on your idiot videos.

These Iowans have issues in the brain, thats why theyre voting for a brain surgeon. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Ben he truly is a brilliant man and I actually agree with him on a lot of issues. You dont get to be a world class brain surgeon by being an idiot. With that being said I really dont see him bringing that energy or pride we need to get us out of this. That is why I changed party affiliation in order to vote for Trump in the primary and general in my home state of New Jersey. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You cant deny any of the points he made, theyre factually proven. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is scary. Trump is a clown, but everyone knows it. Carson is a bigger clown, but hardly anyone is able to see it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is only because they FINALLY took out Biden. Doesnt matter guys, Bernie has the people who will actually go vote for him. Stay focused, we got this shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whatever you may think of her, she did great! She should hire those repugs as campaign workers. They gave her campaign the boost it needed. Lets see what the platform looks like though, and how far Bernie is gonna go. Hillary is a tough cookie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im a huge bernie supporter and I saw the humor in this skit. That being said Ive never heard Bernie scream or cuss but I have seen Hillary act as freaky as the actress portraying her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ive really respected you Bernie supporters and believed you were smart people. Im sad to see the comments here tell me the opposite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Another fake poll. I live in Iowa, and not a soul is supporting Hillary. It is all Bernie and Trump with some Carsons sprinkled in. Where is your god damned journalistic integrity? Where is your coverage of the real front runner Bernie Sanders? Why did you remove your Live Poll when Bernie hit 85% of the vote? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hey CNN, why are you pussies deleting comments about Bernie off your website? The American people are on to your crap <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary Clinton is building a lead over Bernie Sanders in Iowa with help from her debate performance You mean with the help of CNN lying, deleting the immediate pools, which have shown that Bernie won and replacing it with bs misleading polllooking propaganda, and putting it into peoples heads that she performed well? Shes a corporate hack and had very little to say except I represented Wall Street rare truth and vote for me, Im a woman. Pathetic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You cant trust CNN. The company that owns CNN is Hilarys 8th biggest donor <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good more time Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
gee I wonder if you want to talk about those emails now bernie dont worry your sure to be her vice prezident it was probly your plan all alone you crook. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i never voted republican... but if hillary is the dem. nominee. ... carson or trump has my vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The GOP attack has only softened Hillarys image. GOP disaster... Most ironically, the only thing the Committee proved was Mrs Clinton is one tough, competent mofo. Im a Bernie fan, but Hillary won the day, yesterday. Congrats Hillary. You did all DEMs a service facing down the turd wing of the Republican caucus. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Maybe if you stopped editing out Bernies words out of debates and deleting prosanders comments in your site, maybe the democratic political process would be legitimate enough for Sanders to lead Hillary in the polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck you CNN! When Bernie becomes President we are gonna throw your asses in Jail!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Why CNN, you seem to have quite a few disgruntled viewers. Your polls seem to consistently show one thing while the people express exactly the opposite. I think you should consider the accuracy of the source of your information. I say we conduct a poll now. Like this post if your like Bernie Sanders and dislike if you like Hillary Clinton. You do not have to reply. I hope someone will get the point here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You think yesterday felt long? When you are in a solitary confinement prison cell, you will really know what a long day feels like! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders lost the election the day he said people were not interested in her email.That was the lifeline which hillary needed,and the now we seen the results of sanders as a #loser <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is going to win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mark my words CNN, Bernie is going to win this thing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
very interesting but Im still voting for Bernie Sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clinton did not build any lead. Since Biden said he is not running, most of his fans are in favor of Clinton. Bernie has not lost any vote. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Funny, 79% of those polled on this YouTube post support Bernie. Sound familiar? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No matter what, I am voting for Bernie. Feel the fucking Bern CNN, Time Warner, and Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Where is the headtohead against republicans? Right, wasnt polled, because Bernie does better than Hillary h2h against them. Still, 40% right now isnt bad, only 89 more points needed to victory. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

As a Bernie sanders supporter, Im really happy to see these guys rejoicing over an 11 point leadwhich is only because Biden isnt running anymore but they wont say that. this was supposed to be a walkover. Hillary was supposed to destroy Bernie by 70% margins. To see them desperate for any kind of good news about their corporate puppet is heartening. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Your so full of shit CNN, in your scientific debate poll only 30% had seen the debate, the rest saw your BS news Network.. Your Polls dont mean shit! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders is a real human being and a much better leader for the United States. He proves time and time again that his experience and ability to reach across the aisle allows him to focus on real issues facing America. If he doesnt win the election, then it will be Americans who suffer in the longterm future of things. Hes the only politician who will get me to say Name 2016. So, Bernie Sanders for President 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Joe says he wont run, and then proceeds to deliver a long campaign speech. Biden is still very much a candidate in waiting should Hillary be discredited or indicted. The Democratic party leaders are not going to support Bernie Sanders, so you can bet they have a backup plan ready and waiting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is the closest to an intelligent nonpolitician candidate. Biden looks and acts like Jerry Ford, of which Johnson said, He cant walk and chew gum at the same time. Bernie is just an old fool. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im a Bernie supporter. But this report should NOT be crucified. With Biden out of the race almost all of his support goes to Clinton. At 56% it will be quite hard for Bernie to win.

Hi Bernie, my life matters, but... I guess as long as you are prostituting yourself for votes, you can say that All Lives DONT Matter.

LOL Webb you on on the wrong side my friend. Come over to the Right side and leave the socialist criminals to the Dem lie machine. My guess is you see only Jimbo turn Rep, he has great views, Vet, and would be a good blend into the party to give some middle views. Well done Jim, leave that trash behind, your service should not be tarnished with the likes of Hillary and Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Another puppet there to make Hildabeast Stalin look more moderate. Instead of attacking her for facilitating government contracts for donations to the Clinton Foundation and using her private server for classified emails, he gives her a get out of jail free card by saying hes sick about hearing about it all.

Bernie is just another Ron Paul who says things people want to hear to keep us in hope.

Bernie took it with good grace. He knew he had to roll with the punch. But the truth is, the impersonation pissed me off. It is the exact type of left handed jabbing compliment that the establishment is trying to project about Bernie. He is no ordinary politician at the moment...and represents the hopes of millions of Americans who want a fair chance at a little peace and security. No...I think the impersonation was bullshit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BERNIE SANDERS IS CLEARLY THE NUMBER 1 Democratic Guy Its really Him VS Trump, is Hilary paying off CNN? Is that why corporate media wants her to win so bad. U SUCK CNN Report the News STOP TWISTING THE STATS Poll after Poll online shows Sanders is WINNING! IS THAT WHY YOU DELETED 86% for Bernie VOTE ON YOUR OWN crappy page. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Please America vote for Bernie, humanity can be saved because of him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Hillary wins the election I will make sure to contact the UN EU about the most corrupt government on this planet. She is not the #1 candidate CNN and you better stop lying. Bernie Sanders or Trump must win. You better not continue with this corruption if you care about your childrens future staff at CNN because if Hillary wins your country will burn to the ground at the hands of its own citizens. Stop screwing around its pathetic and dangerous. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Huh I dont have much of a horse in this stupid race but really? Hillary Strong and Bernie Money? Uhm, you guys have the two confused especially when your parent company is invested in Ms. Cunton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Paul Ryan would be the only Republican President I would even support. Hes young, hip and Im sure we will get respect from other presidents! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So, all the GOP monkeys can do is toss poo at Bernie Sanders instead of coming up with a reasonable argument? Says a lot about their intelligence...

everyone is sick and tired hearing about your damn emails Bernie as much as gave up the ghost, and helped pave the way for a Hillary victory. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
223 jealous Hillary supporters disliked this video. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So basically Bernie thinks people should get a trophy just for showing up. He still has not explained how he is going to pay for all of this or how he is going to address 9 trillion in debt. All the money from every rich person as it is wouldnt even fund our government from a month. What he is selling isnt sustainable. If we are to be more like Sweden, then we need to first address the many people that dont want to work and have a hood mentality. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn it, I want to see a Bernie Sanders vs Donald Trump. CNN will title it, A Race to the Bottom <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie #FeltTheBern this time.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She is just a bullshitter, all for the chance to hlave power. She is bought out by corporate interests so much anyone could see it a mile away. And fuck CNN, who are misleading who won that debate, when Bernie clearly won and they live in a fantasy land where Hillary won. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
By saying this it shows he is primarily interested in creating a strong middle class , however Hillary is still in the same sinking boat. The FBI is constantly chasing after her and if proven guilty she could actually be imprisoned ! Bernie Sanders also knows shes still in trouble but it showed his morale distantly .#VoteForBernie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
SNL shouldnt have done this. Now both CNN and Fox News are using this segment in their own videos to make Bernie look like a lunatic <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The last piece of credibility you had was lost after the Democratic debate, did you really think people would miss that Bernie won every debate poll out there, even your but still somehow you claim that Hillary won, based on what, whos opinion, yours?It certainly was not your viewers, all 15million of them. Your news channel is becoming a well known propaganda channel, just like FOX, you decide if that is a good thing... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CNN is just trying to push Hilary as the winner of the debate. Anyone that watched the debate knows that Bernie Sanders WON! Fuck this media pushed agenda for Hilary. The title includes Bernie but they dont even mention him once! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love this skit! Larry killed it coming from a huge Bernie supporter. Have you seen his website and political infrastructure? 100s of thousands of people gathering at his events across the country.

Lol Bernie has zero balls. He knows that putting people in groups by saying black lives matters instead of all lives matters actually separates us and encourages racism. He said it for political reasons, to avoid blowback from the PC police and to win an election. But of course the Bernie cult refuse to accept anything remotely negative about him because theyre all brainwashed sheep. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I can honestly say Im voting for Bernie Sanders because whatever the case I do not want Hilary gain the Democratic nomination. But mark my words in the end Jeb Bush will get the GOP nomination because the establishment wants him.

Such puppets these CNN presentators, after the way the censored information surrounding Bernie Sanders and the democratic debate a few days ago, now happily reporting about Sanders on SNL. Their censorship went as far as blocking a semiofficial Bernie YT channel for broadcasting their debate which was actually allowed, if regulations play any role. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Daily reminder that CNN is owned by Time Warner Cable which is one of Hilarys biggest campaign contributors. 81% of the people on CNNs poll believe Sanders won the debate so they took the poll down and declared Hilary the winner. They even resorted to deleted pro Bernie sanders comments on their Facebook page. CNN corrupt Hilary shills. Fuck CNN, #FeelTheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Why does the Clinton News Network CNN promote Hillary Clintons campaign? Youre not supposed to publicly endorse a candidate idiots. Just do it privately like everyone else. All you do is report on every shit Donald Trump takes and bash Bernie Sanders. Even though Bernie attacks the Koch brothers all the time and talks about voting rights and he actually means it! Typical corporate media. Who even watches this shit? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
come on people Bernie is a one lifetime choice. he is revolutionizing American politics. he even pulled Hillary to the left. i dont dislike Hillary but Bernie is a far better and one time choice. THINK about it. #PleaseBernie2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
come on people Bernie is a one time choice. he is revolutionizing politics. just think about it. Hillary has been pulled to the the left thanks to Bernie. I dont hate her, but Bernie is a far better and one time choice. #PleaseBernie2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The American people need to own the mainstream media. Theyve gotten way too out of hand. No integrity. No honor. Just a bunch of billionaires lying to us through their talking heads. It has to stop. Vote Bernie and clear the shills out of Congress. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He didnt say this to benefit Hillary. CNN cut out some of what Bernie said to give the impression he was supporting Hillary. In fact he is angry at the Press and at Hillary for this email crap. The candidates were up there to discuss the important issues facing Americans. The People dont care about Hillarys damn emails, but more importantly they dont care about damned Hillary. She simply cant be trusted. And she doesnt care about you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The networks need to be owned by the voting citizens of the US. That is because integrity and honor has gone out the window. They are lying at every opportunity. Once we install Bernie and clear out the shills in Congress we will take over the media. Just watch it unfold. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The mainstream media including CNN are going to get more and more slanted as this campaign goes on. Theyve completely lost their credibility with the online people. And now the word is spreading to regular people that we cant trust the billionaire owned networks anymore to tell us the truth. Bernie Sanders WILL be our next President. So eat it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Up against super pacs, billionaires? Hillary You HAVE a superpac. Your top contributors are BANKS. Billionaire Donald freaking Trump donated 100, 000 to the Clinton Foundation. Billionaire Haim Saban donated to your super pac for you to fight against palestinians wtf hillary? spouting bullshit <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Biden is the backup in case Hillary is prosecuted or drops out. Cant have Bernie as President. He cant be bought. Biden supports the TPP and NAFTA and doesnt want GlassSteagall reinstated. This is good enough to prove hes just another bought and paid for shill for the billionaire class. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The People of the US dont care about Hillary. She lost miserably to Bernie in the debates. She has become a footnote. Billionaire owned CNN is very nervous about Bernie getting elected and will do anything now, including lying to the Public. Shame shame on you CNN. You rich little rascals. Too bad, we know what you are up to. So eat it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Country finally waking up to find HILLARY rallying a communist invasion of illegal immigrants just like Bernie, pandering to non citizens to get elected. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Youre Peter, by the way. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie 2016. Fuck CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Holy shit, I cant believe Bernie just said that. That was the most racist comment Ive heard on the campaign trail yet. He literally just implied my life doesnt matter because I am not an African American. Definitely not getting my support. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I 100% agree!! I am a Bernie Sanders supporter, and I happen to think that we should all be focused on the major issues effecting this country, and not emails. If Hillary loses her lead, she should be losing for the right reasons her policies and views are not as good as Sanders views are. I happen to think that Bernie Sanders is a much better candidate and he stands for everything I stand for. I am voting for him for that reason, not because I dont like Hillary Clintons emails <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How could anyone possibly down vote this when she is absolutely in the right about everything she said in this video? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hillary2016! Lets go. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNNs polls, as well as all other polls and study groups, show Bernie Sanders won the debate by margins mostly greater than 30 points. Their latest video on how HILLARY WON cites a new CNN poll showing hillary won by 30 points... At least Fox news puts some passion and womens barelegs into lying to us! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol I can only laugh at the politicians trying to protect eachother. Clinton committed a felony Bernie... let the FBI do their job! If she is found innocent or guilty then let us all abide by that decision .... but for now.. the judicial system go all the way. Trying to play it down is like trying to sweep it under the carpet which is CORRUPT! We expect more from you Bernie! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary committed a crime with her emails Bernie. People in America had been sent to prison for smaller felonies. LET THE FBI DO THEIR JOB, AND DONT PUSH THIS UNDER THE CARPET LIKE A CORRUPT POLITICIAN Bernie!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Mark my words Bernie Sanders will be the next president of the United States. These are exciting times. I am hopeful once again that the country can put aside its differences and work together as one. P.S. Hes absolutely right. Gun control should be left up to the states. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary did ok but she lost this one. Bernie won the debate BY A LANDSLIDE. Dont believe the corporate media which is trying to give Clintons bid life support. Look at 54 seconds in, and compare to figure 1 <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wouldnt Biden split the vote between Hillary and himself putting Bernie in front? Or does Biden appeal to the Bernie folks? I think Bernies following is much more ideologically driven and loyal, Hillarys backers dont even trust her. and would split. Either way the media is portraying that it is over for Hillary if Biden enters. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah, we dont want to hear about Hillarys damn emails, Hillarys issues, or Hillary Clinton. We want to hear about the issues that affect the American people. Thats what Bernie is about, the issues affecting us... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders was the only sane person on this issue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People..... stop being disingenuous. You know what he meant. Gosh why is this a conversation. This is so frustrating and its making me realize America just might not ever be great. Cant even getbon the same page about simple shit because people want to be stubborn and disengenous just so they can spite Bernie and his supporters. This ladies and gentlemen are the American voters. You KNOW what he meant. Anyone who pretends he didnt should no longer even be entertained. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Because today you can just say shit and its true without any bit of proof or even slightest element of reason whatsoever. Just speak for the American people Bernie go ahead. Considering that the Republicans wont shut up about it maybe their constituents care, lol or it could be that the Republicans have just as much to hide. BTW as much as he clammers on about the private banks being too big to fail, is Bernie ever going to mention the Federal Reserve and its track record? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie is 80% in online polls, and he is undoubtedly the democratic king of the Internet. Sadly, the majority of nonInternet using democrats still support Hillary. It is our job to help Bernie get his message to these people who only have the proHillary mainstream media as a source of information. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I do like Bernie as a person, but, his economic ideas would be failures in America. His free shit for everybody campaign of course is appealing but it is fantasy . This variance on socialism does not take into account economies of scale this is not Europe , but having said that, I do like him. He is real and he actually does want the best for America even if his ideas wont work. And Im with him that most in the rep party are far right neo cons nut jobs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

this is infuriating. so this news outlet makes a bias, possibly even financially bias, judgement call on the debates, even sneaking in a few groundless jabs right from the start, and then while swimming against the tide of support for bernie they go so far as to just make shit up? is this really happening in my country? i really thought A.C. was a journalist. i sincerely thought he was the real deal. this is ridiculous, but i cannot laugh. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie has this. Clinton is as transparent as glass. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sander wants to spend 18 trillions dollars in 10 years when the American debt is already 18 trillion dollars. Republicans and Democrats should be working to reduce the debt before other countries remove the American dollar as a world reserve currency. He want to waste money on government programs that create the problem in the first place. Americans need less government inference in their lives. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You are not changing any minds CNN. Your brainwashing on the people is finished and we can see through all your lies. All the propaganda you spew against Bernie, shall backfire.

Strategic tomfoolery. They need Hilary stories that dont revolve around the 24 hour GOP attacks on her, but they dont want to publicize her race with Bernie Sanders because it diminishes her as a leader and brings more attention to his ideas that they dont want to support. This way they can spin it as a race between Hilary and Biden, who are virtually identical on policy, generate a bunch of positive stories about Hilary, and marginalize Bernie Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck CNN Go Bernie Sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Why doesnt CNN cover all the lies told on the last Republican debate? Hmm interesting, CNN is full of shit, and just focuses on trying to bring down the democrats. Bittersweet though, this shoes they see Bernie as a threat #feelthebern#bernie2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>

This analysis of the debate is so disingenuous. CNN knows very well from their own poll they posted and then quickly removed that Bernie was the clear winner of this debate in every measure. CNN is losing a lot of credibility with this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CNN has become such a BullShit Channel... they are going on a panic mode trying to attack Bernie....... VA Scandal?

Only kids use Facebook? What??? Everybody uses Facebook. Was this approach CNNs way to water down Bernie winning the debate by 75%? Oh, where is CNNs own poll that shows Bernie winning by 81%. Hummmm... cant find it. They must have taken it down. But why???????? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Are you kidding me CNN?! Bernie created additional instructional videos on how to better just do there jobs, what more can you ask for!?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Lets get something straight here. There is no other candidate that has fought harder for equal health care for ALL people. He was in a situation where funding and resources for veterans have been scarce for decades and fought a battle for that increase in funds. If you cant afford to take care of our veterans, dont send them to war Sen. Bernie sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fuck Anderson and cnn . They cant find shit on sanders now they are trying to to make an elephant out of an fly . More reason to vote for Bernie . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I agree with everyone below this is propoganda. There is no other candidate who will be a better advocate for veterans than Bernie, and the people know it! CNN, your behavior is unethical, even evil, in upholding the status quo which is destroying our planet, our civil rights, basically everything that the Time Warner and its shareholders dont care about. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN should be criticized for taking down their own polls showing Bernie winning the debate by a landslide. Then changing the polls on their site from showing Bernie winning, to a prediction poll showing Biden and Hilary leading Bernie. CORRUPTION <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is it clear to any other libertarians how Bernie Sanders is no different to the average politician? Hes pro government and I dont know if he gives any thought to economics. He wants government to run so much but fails to see where the money will come from. He has the appeal Obama once had but his policies are horrible. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

When is the liberal media going to give up on gotcha journalism and actually talk about what the people actually want to hear about?

First, They say Bernie lost the debate when vast majority of Americans know otherwise, then they delete ProSanders comments, now this. Lets see how long this comment will stay up before they delete it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Let me get this straight.

Watch on youtube a Bernie Sanders rally video. Go to berniesanders.comissues. Now what do you think of Bernie. The conservative site drudgereport.comnow.htm puts Bernie as winning. He got 54% of the votes while Hillary only got 9%. The CNN poll showed 81% voted for Bernie. Then CNN quickly took the poll results down because they want Hillary to win the election. Thats because she is a bought and paid for shill for the super rich including those who own CNN. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The statement is Do black lives matter OR Do all lives matter. All lives matter implies all lives are equally important and we shouldnt sympathize disproportionately based on simply race. Black lives matter is a phrase in response to violence by police disproportionately against black people.

That is why Bernie Sanders has much more credibility as he has been honest in his stances. #BernieFor2016 #feeltheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump has some smart good looking kids I will give him that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is not only a better man than Trump will ever be, he is also richer than Trump will ever be. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is straight class. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Honestly I liked him. Im a Bernie supporter, but I feel that he has good views that align closely with mine, and the bias in the debates was clearly against him, so its not surprising that he wasnt able to have the kind of showing he wanted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hahah Bernie is losing badly in the polls dont kid yourself Trump. I dont think youve been looking at any polls recently. you can actually check them out on CN....oh thats right....Theyre just as afraid of Bernie and the people as you are. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie won the debate in my and most others opinions. CNN and many others have a BIAS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fuck body language, policy is what matters. I dont give a fuck who looks more presidential or not. What I give a shit about is who has the passion and a better chance of taking the right steps into making this a better society for everyone. Bernie Sanders has the best policy ideas and dont suck up to the big corporations like everyone else does. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, well, well! It looks like the Trump trolls have come over to Bernie to complain. It seems that Bernie is beating Hillary. Well, Trump is scared to face Bernie. That is why he put out an attack ad against Senator Sanders earlier today. #VoteBernieSanders #Bernie2016 #FeelTheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The democratic candidate has already been chosen, or bought and paid for I should say <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is why I like Bernie. He is straight up and doesnt talk around questions and tells it straight without sugar coating <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Does Bernie know what gun show loophole even means? Of course, because it doesnt exist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is this a fashion show or a presidential debate? Holy whit CNN, so shallow, anything to avoid talking about how Bernie crushed that debate according to your own poll. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, which means he was a draft dodger and refused to fight for his country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To all Bernie and possible Biden supportersHeres how things play out.Hillary is getting the nomination, and you will vote for Hillary.Do you know why?Because whatever differences you have with Hillary will be nothing compared to the Reps controlling all 3 branches of government.So suck it up and do the right thing! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
At what point will you drop out? Wolf Blitzer and the media can go screw itself for its bullshit bias. Chafee may have done poorly and not have the support as Hillary and Bernie, however hes a very good man. Disliked. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Poor Chafee. He actually seems genuine in general. But he could have told the truth that the prevailing wisdom at the time was that deregulation would spur growth and it didnt work... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This shit is soooo scripted!!! Does everyone really think Sanders just thought that up on his own about Clintons emails? No. He was told to say that just like bringing up campaigns being funded by big business. Of course it is and theyre all just a bunch of puppets told to read the script and go with the narrative. Everyone wake up to this falsefake political system. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So much for that honest Bernie huh? Not like you retarded supporters care of course. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go bernie Sanders ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder how much money CNN spent on this incredibly stupid story.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the reason why bernie sanders said black lifes matter is because its true, we need major reform in a brocken society and of cousre all lifes matter huys come on have some common sense ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God please let this race be between Rand and Bernie!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes great point CNN....My observations of body language are as follows...Bernie looks like a meek guy who will do anything to make Hilary happy and Hilary looks like a power hungry monster who will reach out and kill anyone in close proximity if she doesnt get to be president. Dont stand so close Bernie,,,I know why you gave her the debate, she scares the shit out of me too. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Time Warner Inc owns CNN. Time Warner Inc is Hillarys 7th biggest financial supporter. CNN is posting all over that Hillary won the debate. CNNs own polls show that 81% of their viewers think Bernie won. CNN will not even post the results of their own poll. If this isnt some Orwellian 1984 crap, I dont know what is. We need to show corporations that were not taking the manipulation anymore. #Bernie2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Remember to Vote for Bernie in the primary or he will not be president. It happens early next year I believe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Did you hear, Donald Trump was trying to distract the audience while the Debate was going on? is he conning or what? I would not doubt that he is paying these people to pose as Bernie Sanders supporters to put negative comments about Hillary.He has a lot of money to do that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hillary is voting for bernie probably <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders has gutted Ron Pauls Audit the Fed bill back in the day, which would have exposed the whole Federal Reserve criminal syndicate that has been extracting American wealth for over a century now. No, no, no, we cant have that, right Bernie? Just another bankster puppet playing his role on this grand stage, just like the rest of these sellouts. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hilary is not the strongest you guys cant come up with good arguments in why Hilary won because there isnt BERNIE WON so now you go with body language LOL geez how desperate are you guys in trying to make Bernie look bad GTFO HERE CNN I lost all respect to this shitty news source <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is an example on what big establishment media does. Bernie Sanders won on all the polls and still they try to act like Hillary won the debate. smh <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like Bernie Sanders, but there is no way America would vote for him. No one has ever said Hillary Clinton was perfect, but she can win! If all Democrats care about is ideological purity then we risk becoming that shit show in the republican party the tea baggers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Holy sh1t, who gives a fuck. I want to here their ideas, not fucking Oh LOOK how Hillary strides in like a champion and Bernie looks like a fighter, Da fuck is this, who fucking cares. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Housing, health care, basic food rations and other services ALL FREE from the state That 100 sounds like it could go far. North Korea doesnt sounds so bad..... if you think about it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders basically shot himself in the foot, when he shook hands with Hillary Clinton about the emails. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
one of the best moment of the debate funny .... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How the hell did Clinton win? Competition? Bernie wiped the floor using Clintons tears. CNN go fuck yourself and your propaganda crap. T...t...t..today jr Her damn stuttering is real. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Every online poll shows Bernie winning by an landslide. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Hilary gets the Ticket, you can bet your ass shell immediately forget about being a self proclaimed progressive. Shell say anything to get elected. The only reason she talks about things like prison reform is because Bernie brought it up and she saw how popular it was among Democrats. Bernie has been consistent his whole life. He is the only genuine Democratic candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie all the way!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders, the man of a one trillion dollar stimulus and single payer health care, criticized OMalley for not proposing realistic policies. I respect that. But it annoys me to no end when Sanders supporters happily denounce Clinton for the exact same thing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie raised 1 million in contributions overnight. Feel the Bern! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is a politician but hes a politician thats willing to speak the truth when it matters. I give him for having the backbone to speak the truth about the Black Lives Matter movement and the criminal justice institutional racism that plaques or country. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN deleted their own live poll when it showed Bernie had won the debate by a landslide. typical media manipulation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNN Owned by Time Warner Bernie Criticizes mainstream media Hillary 500,000 campaign contribution from Time Warner. That is all. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
TELL EM BERNIE!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders oozes pure undiluted decency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
but does all crime matter. the democratic party is the party of keeping people poor and ignorant. when do cops lives matter when does illegal immigration matter when does life matter when its a baby or when it has killed other people.democrats kill babies but want to save people who would rape and kill babies thts fe up. Bernie is a joke hillary too, you voters for them can only take our money so long. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders the PC wingbag and coward refuses to say ALL Lives Matter. Yes racism is still alive and well as anyone with a brain knows, and you can also thank Mr. Obama for contributing to a new race war in America like pouring gas on a fire. Well done Mr. Pres, your job is over you can now go play golf full time and move to Iran to be with your muslim brothers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie the Ned Stark of American politics <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Instead of addressing the real problem, which is the need for serious nationwide Policing reforms.... were chanting childish DIVISIVE slogans. Yet in a round about way I guess I agree with Bernie somewhat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All lives matter, to say anything otherwise is racist. If you want to talk about the 200 blacks killed each you by police.....Will you include the over 400 whites killed by police also? Are we in a effort to help our black Americans going to address the black on black murders that happen in the thousands each year? I am waiting Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie worked in the Banking Industry. He is on the side of Wall Street! How can Democrats be so stupid? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am not a trump supporter, but I am really curious to see what he would do for all of us, as Americans, for our Nation! I mean we know what politicians have done! MADE A MESS OUT OF EVERY THING!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders 2016! #FeelTheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Socialism is social. The PeopleSocietyNation come first before the individual, which is the complete antithesis of Capitalism, where the individual comes first, then society. Bernie Sanders is a Democratic Socialist, which is the political view most common in Europe. This essentially means that he still believes in capitalism. A capitalism that must be controlled and regulated to serve the needs of the people, and not just serve themselves at the cost of everything else. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Preach on Bernie!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Holy cow, the mental gymnastics people use are pitiful. The guy asked Bernie, do black lives matter or do all lives matter. Bernie answered with,Black lives matter. Since when did black lives matter black lives and all other lives matter when he was given the option to choose between the two? He clearly only stated one answer and that is black lives matter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And I thought Bernie couldnt get any better...I was wrong. Bernies the man!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie is a Hillary plant. He will drop out so she gets his votes because nobody likes her. Why else would he drop the ball on the email scandal? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is telling it as it is. Ordinary people in the US and well as the UK have continually voted against their own interests without even knowing it. He just wants to create a society where alot more people are doing well as opposed to just a minority at the top. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I thought Bernie said only gun manufactures who knowingly sell to criminals should be charged? Oh yeah, CNN is stupid... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

CNNs own poll showed Bernie won that debate by 80%. yet no mention of that today... Which is exactly why he has so much support around the country...

In future debates, some effort should be made to give the candidates Equal Time. This guy got screwed and Chafee got 9 minutes out of 2 hours! Webb made a good, sensible, point about the potential need for weapons to defend ourselves against terrorists and other nutcases. Hilary wasnt held to what she said in 2007 so why should Webb be?

Hillary was feeling the bern at that moment <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would probably vote for Hillary or Bernie. I would probably vote for Hillary untill proven 100% guilty by the government. I would not believe what people say untill the government proves it true. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why not best of Bernie Sanders ?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
first ill say of course all lives matter, But People saying All Lives matter as an opposition to black lives matter is like a rich kid getting mad that an orphan gets a free toy and demands one too <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look at the public feedback. How dare CNN lie and run bunch of stories about Hillary winning the debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a rare moment in a debate. Bernies legit. Hillary has good ideas too. Every member of that 5 person debate would be better than the entire Republican field. Liberals, progressives and Democrats are simply smarter than the hypocritical conservative Republicans with their Bible that they dont even follow. Good luck in 2016, youll need it you ass clowns. Try the southern strategy again, its like an no brainer instant win right? Haha, fucking morons. Here comes another landslide. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I predict it will eventually be Sanders vs. Carson... Which is nothing for Bernie!!! Feel the Bern 2016!!! Its so sad that Carson and Trump are the only one polling double digits nationally on the GOP side. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who cares about republicans, they are hasbeens. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Just one of the MANY reasons to vote BERNIE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie has always emphasized the income disparity is the worst among DELVELOPED WESTERN NATIONS... not 3rd world stats from the World Bank... so its an unfair criticism. As to increased wages, theyre worthless in contrast to cost of living increases... Such journalism is tepid weak teaDishonest <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Whats the difference between a good Hillary and a great Hillary? A good Hillary understands and practices the law properly. A great Hillary is tight with the billionaires on Wall Street and selectively ignores laws. chacheeing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wonder if the leftwing liberal moderators will throw these tough questions at the democrat debate.. Whats your favorite color? If you could pick a puppy, which breed would you pick?

funny how you people say when a cop murders someone its horrible but when someone is emotional unstable and the cop dosent kill him, you say he shoulda been murdered ? which one is it. idk about you but i think its best if most situations ended like this with the man arrested and the cop going about his day. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i hope they catch him , beat him up so bad that he spends the rest of his life in a wheelchair he gets life in jail gets dry bummed every day in jail and then gets cancer , then when he has 1 year left of his sentence air drop him into an issis camp by parachute with a aid parcel full of pork and bacon sandwiches and a crate of beer <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Murdochs simple strategy is this Step 1 Help get another Democrat elected. Step 2 Continue fear mongering via Faux, NYP, WSJ, etc etc. Step 3 Profit ....

With what money are we going to build and man a 1969 mile border? We already waste a few billion dollars a year deporting a whopping 4% of illegal immigrants. Besides, the wall would be useless. The design that was discussed can be defeated in under five minutes by a few guys with tin snips, and there are literally dozens of other ways to illegally enter America besides running over the border. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont agree with Bernie about anything, but I have given him money twice and I will do it again. I am helping him because he answers questions and tells the truth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie is the man. Wake up America, and take notice of Bernie Sanders. He is fighting for you and the things you love. He is fighting the very powers that rule this world practically all by himself. He will be your next President. Join the Revolution and regain your freedom and stop living on your knees to the corporations. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie mostly says the right things but when does he ever talk about peace? The moral failure of this country at present is the utter lack of a peace movement. Sorry, Bernie is falling far short of being a good man. If he is what he says he is then he would be much more outspoken against war. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The media as a whole needs to quit giving Bernie the Ron Paul treatment regardless of his policies hes a genuine guy when it comes to improving americans lives , everybody knows the same isnt true about Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A man of integrity. I used to be a militant atheist before converting to Christianity. And let me say this... I agree with him on almost every single point. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The African American community and the Latinos should get behind Bernie because he could help their causes more than any other candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Let us face facts in our evil American government. Obama is a fag and most of congress are humping each other like fags. We know most of the Demotards like Hillary, Bernie, and half the Republicans are fags. Most our judges in America are fags. These judges needs to be impeached and treat these fag judges as a disgrace to America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BS....this is a non issue....the real issue is that she voted to authorize the war in Iraq. That just means that shes willing to attack countries that have not attacked us and will probably do so to Iran which is very very very bad. Bernie Sanders is the only logical choice for anyone who knows enough about any of the candidates I think. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Go Bernie Sanders!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HILLARY IS RIGHT ....SCREW THE EMAILS ....HILLARY IS A NEOCON PRO TPP , PRO IRAQ WAR , SHILL FOR THE 911 FALSE FLAG , PUPPET , IN WAR , SHIT HAPPENS ....

His speech Lets target their money... ok that work a bit. Lets appeal to their xenophobia... ok not so much. Fine, lets appeal to their religious beliefs, thatll get em going...

They put this crap on but no sign of Sanders policies like his plans of abolishing private prisons. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

AMERICANS have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked and in FAVOR of those AT THE TOP HILLARY CLINTON LOL wtf.... thats why i will vote for, BERNIE SANDERS 2016 ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a conservative I can say I would rather Bernie then killary . However I would never vote for him I can agree with the Bernie supporters we both hate hillary and we both hate the super pac that controls these puppets on both sides <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah, Bernie, stop George Soros, the billionaire. I have heard he collaborated with Nazis during the second WW and now is helping all those who want a fascist government controlling all aspects of our lives. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a nice man, but nice doesnt cut it in the big league. Trump is a absolute beast and we need a tough and sharp president. Carson would be a weak president and we need a fighter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump 2016!!!!!! Ben Carson is a nice guy, TOO NICE to run the country in a political system that will eat him alive!.... Trump is pure metal!.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
vote for bernie! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am highly considering Sanders, however I have enough awareness to see that the TV media has a very liberal bias. CNBC moderators antagonized the republican candidates even more so than CNN. They greatly set the tone and substance of the debate with their trap questions. Also, some of these guys have good ideas. It would be blind of me to not have an open , clear mind and see the entire picture. I, of course, am not most people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah, Hillarys chance is swiftly turning in to a snowballs chance in hell against Bernie. One could say... shes #FeelingTheBern. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As a National Socialist Im voting for Sanders or Hillary. The American ppl will become complacent if we elect Trump but Hillary or Bernie will speed up the decay of America giving us a chance to leaping out of the boiling pot before its too late. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is love. Bernie is life. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

According to the American people Bernie Sanders won the debate by a large margin, in the polls and some had Hillary in third place. The media may want to everyone to think Hillary did, but the majority of the people like the message Bernie is delivering, theyre tired of the same old establishment politics Hillary offers, which caters to rich! Its time for a change vote Bernie! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You stupid millennial cocksuckers. Talk to Swedes and you will find out their country is turning to shit. They cant afford Bernies wet dream, and its all beginning to unravel. Scandinavian Socialism is not Socialism, dipshits! They have a massive welfare net but they are very capitalist as well. And all you have to do is talk to real people, not read a fucking poll or happiness index, and youll see they arent all that satisfied. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Bernie! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is winning in the most important polls <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What these people fail to understand is that Bernies stance on guns will gain a lot of votes in rural states. Like most of the south. It might even bring in moderate Republicans who are sick of the tea party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie won <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders won last night! ! #feelthebern Bernie Sanders needed the Name recognition. Bernie Sanders was trending on Twitter and most searched on Google and huge on Facebook <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie will win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The other Three sounded like theyve been studying Sanders. Its enough disIngenuity to make ya sick. Glad theyre die hard progressives now. But Bernie could have used that help on the NSA vote, or the Iraq vote, or the NAFTA vote. #Sanders2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary attacks Sanders on guns, and Sanders defends Hillary on emails. Now Corporate Media says Hillary won?. I think Bernie is a gentleman, and the best candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary remained in command on the issues? Really? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is smart as hell <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a piece of political theatre. Bernie Sanders is just another Democan warmonger, and hes throwing the debates for Hillary Rape Denier Clinton. Feel the bern? Think of all the Muslims Bernie Sanders and Clinton will burn alive if either one gets elected president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary is a liar! Plain and simple. She constantly changes her stances based on public opinion. She basically tried to emulate Bernie in many ways and that only served to show her hand and expose her as a fraud. Shes such a phony! If shes elected, it will be more of the same downward spiral for America. Shell continue to serve her rich interests and sell all of us little guys out. Bernie is our only hope to get our country back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Didnt want to talk about the poll that showed Bernie won the debate by 75 percent to clintons 11? Time to bring in the back up establishment figure, Biden <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is the only viable candidate for President of the United States. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernies authenticity, foresight and reasoning have been unparallelled and unmatched in this election. I have no doubt his poll numbers will surpass Clintons. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie just destroyed Hillary in the first debate!!! #feelthebern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Our economy cant afford Bernies free education! TRUMP 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, Sanders invested a few mil into an army of online trolls it would seem.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I bet this debate will be completely different than the one for the gop...what is your favorite color hillary? what is your favorite holiday bernie? unless one of the bottom feeders push for attention by calling hillary a lying bull dyke or bernie the geezer a communist it will be completely different...just remember the way CNN and even Fox went after the Republicans...Anderson cooper works for the clinton foundation so it will be protect and deflect all night <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is anyone else preparing ? Its all about Hillary, and a guy who isnt even in the race. BARF. All Bernie is doing is promising to play nice, I guess he has no other agenda. From this coverage it seems like this debate exists only for Hillary. Im more interested in what Bernie has to say. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LOL @ all the Bernie Saunders supporters trolling Hillarys video. Oh Well Good luck to Bernie nonetheless..But #Hillary2016 ALL THE WAY!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

According to Republicans every Democrat in the last years has been a Socialist. Clinton and Obama has been called Socialists. They overused the insult to a point where nobody cares anymore. So what? Bernie is the next Socialist after Obama WHO CARES? Bernie for president! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders draws a crowd of 32,000 people this weekend and you dont say a word about it. Instead you talk about Hillary and gun control? We all know it is a problem with the mentally ill not being identified and treated properly. Even Teddy Kennedys son says it. Bernie has drawn almost 500,000 people at his rallies. The 32k attendance is a historical record. Id say it is a newsworthy item, yet the MSM is silent about it. Wow. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I wish that we could elect President Obama for a third term. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Actually, I as a Bernie supporter actually am antiHillary. She supported or at least waffled on a trade deal that I think is disastrous. So yes, I am against her getting into office.

If Bernie was a female he would win hands down, no question about it. Anyone with the slightest interest in politics knows that Hillary is in it to please her billionaire buddies.

Sen. Bernie Sanders Says U.S. Should Look More Like Scandinavia. Does he mean a much much smaller population of white people that are basically all cousins and are unified with long historical cultural beliefs and practices and have massive oil and gas resources to pay for everything.

Hi everybody, Ive been reading the comment section, and Ive noticed many of you are in favour of Bernie Sanders. Im not American nor do I live in the United States, I do not know anything about him or his political beliefs therefore Im keen on knowing why he is so popular and how he makes a difference compared to the other candidates ? Just a candid question truly, thank you for your answers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As much as I try to excited about Hillary Clintons Presidency I dont find any passion in supporting her and dont find she is as believable as Bernie Sanders. I #FeelTheBern! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This comment section is hilarious! Its all Bernie supporters in the top comments with responses from the uneducated people who think Social Democrat is synonymous with Communist. But between Hillary and Bernie, Bernie is really the only sane option. Hes outpolling all the republicans. Hillary, not so much. Democrats making Hillary their nominee would pretty much be shooting themselves in the foot. And the wound will take 4 years to heal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To support Trump you have to be a racist or a moron or both. There are not enough racist morons to put him in power. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

There can be no doubt that Donald Trump has hurt the Republican Party and this may be one reason Bernie Sanders is Doing so well. You have to feel a little Sorry for the well meaning Republicans for they have the Loud Mouth Braggart Donald Trump saying many things that makes the Republican Party Look Bad. Donald Trump may in the end, be responsible for the Republicans losing the Presidential Election in year 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The thing I like about Donald Trump is that he doesn take shit from anyone. That being said, if he was ever elected it would be a disaster. The rest of the republican candidates are already bought and paid for by the wealthy. The only real choice is Bernie Sanders. I believe he genuinely cares about Americans and has many good ideas. Hillary is disconnected from the everyday American, a sellout, and only offers more of the same. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is the election when the Millennials will make our positions heard, and many of us support Bernie Sanders as a true representative of the American people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I proudly support Bernie Sanders for President because he truly lays out the most important issues and real ways to fix them. These problems could be terrifying when you list them, and yet Bernie makes us feel powerful because we are aware and we can have faith in our collective voice and in him as our leader. He wants to help us help ourselves. He cares about uniting us and helping all of us, not just the top 1% #feelthebern #berniesanders #bernie2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders is pretty amazing but theres no way hes going to get all his ideas done in a 4 year term. Maybe if Obama helps him out but Idk if his health will be good for a 2nd term which he would need Im also interested in his foreign policies. I think he would command respect from foreign leaders If all these ppl that thinks conspiracy this n that in America is real then you need to show up n vote for this guy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Anyone voting for her, should check out BERNIE SANDERS. He does not accept money from ANY corporate, he does not accept ANY superPAC. Bernie Sanders is for the middle class, he wants FREE COLLEGE, FREE HEALTHCARE, FREE DAYCARE. He wants to do something against climate change, he wants to tax the rich and wall street. He is a man for the people, Hillary is a women for Wall Street and the top 1%. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Is in any surprise the same company endorsing this commercial ad for Hillary remarked so belittling of Bernie Sanders in his polling against her? Its clear ABC has a biased opinion. I have a biased opinion too. Im getting ready to NOT vote for her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary will win next presidential elections. And not because of her competance. She will only win because she is not a republican and because she is a woman. Bernie Sanders is a next president American needs. Sadly, he isnt supported by corporate media and he isnt a part of the oligarchy that has been running USA. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
US capitalism is failing the middle class and the poor. Tax the rich and corporation a higher rate. They make too much and pay less taxes than you or me. Go Bernie! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Everywhere I go it seems, everyone has a lot of really good things to say about Bernie, and I almost find nobody that says anything bad about him, and a lot of support and presidential wishes. If he doesnt get the Democratic nod and doesnt become president, then theres got to be someone behind the curtains running the show and if thats the case, our country is in deeper trouble than I previously thought. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The only way Hillary win win is by literally buying votes. She has no chance when people hear Bernies message. Hillary is a homophobic banker loving corporatist who doesnt give a damn about the middle class, women or any other minority. Bernie actually cares about all those groups. If you are an American who wants to see real progressive change, vote Sanders in the primaries. Bernie Sanders 2016 ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Even with all the evidence in your face, you talking heads sound like horse and buggy owners telling me that the automobile will never catch on, radio station owners telling me TV is just a fad or TV news networks trying to tell me the internet is just for porn and cat videos and that Bernie Sanders is somehow not going to be president of the United States.

Of course they try to discredit Bernies campaign as serious at the very end. Fuck these nonbelievers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need Bernie as president. Im only 14 and Im afraid we arent a democracy anymore. We are run by the elite of the elite and its sad. And they are probably using Donald Trump as well for distraction, and hes a idiot also so. #FeelTheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary Clinton is not ahead because people actually like her ideas, shes ahead because of her name recognition and because a certain percentage of people want there to be a first woman president at all costs. As the primaries start getting closer and more people from Hillarys side get to know what Bernie Sanders is about, the poll margins will narrow considerably. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I will never ever vote for Hillary or any of the Republicans. They talk about issues that dont matter at all to me. Mass media is a propaganda lie machine showing us only candidates that stand for the rich. We need to get money out of politics, healthcare for all education to become strong.

Billionaire owned Media is discounting Bernie.

Note that if Hillary is the Democratic nominee, or another candidate, I will support them 100%, and I hope they do the same when Bernie wins. We must be united going into the general election, because we know whats coming. Weve seen the conservative Republican playbook. The Kochs have pledged 900 million to get Republican corporate stooges elected, and 2014 showed that right wingers will flood the media with negative attack ads based on lies to get their way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ABC is so condescending there at the end. Despite every indication otherwise, they end with not worried about the nomination, just dont want to get beat in Iowa. Yeah, she doesnt want to get beat in NH either, but that is going to happen. SC is an open primary state and Bernie does well with Independents and Republicans. Not only is ABC dead wrong, but this thing wont even last until Super Tuesday. Her campaign will collapse after SC. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Just out of curiosity When Senator Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination for the Presidency what exactly happens to Hillary Clintons war chest of billions of dollars?

Bernie Sanders is far better qualified and has years of experience battling for the interest of American people, even when he could have sold out to big money donors he did not and thats allowed him a lot of credibility something McCaskill and Hillary need to learn from.

That race question was so cheap and honestly I doubt the integrity of those statistics. Most lgbt activists and blacklivesmatter activists I know are 100% proBernie Sanders. Hillary may have a dedicated fan base of white suburban moms, but millennialist and activists and the oppressed classes of our country are voting for Bernie Sanders. That is why he will win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ah damn it. It was all good until the 15 an hour bit. Why Bernie why!? That is such a dumb issue in politics right now. Any sort of government restrictions on wages reap havoc on the economy. Just look at Seattle. Please look at Seattle, Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
More important than electing Bernie..... Is voting for congressmen and senators that will support his agenda and not block it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Please, oh please dont believe those Republican candidates who are starting to acknowledge that they can no longer be the party of the rich. Dont be deceived. These Republicans are surfing on the wave of populism that Bernie Sanders has built. Not a single one of them will do anything but hand tax breaks over to the richest Americans.

Look at his voting record and tell me that he is anything but correct. If we would have had Bernie as president, there would be No Iraq war, No patriot act, No Nafta, Cafta, etc. We would still be in America instead of this Plutocracy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie has little chance of winning. He is too radical. Socialism doesnt work in the large scale. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I do not think it is a good idea 6 months before any voting begins Bernie Saunders to say he is going to win New Hemisphere. I think Hillary will do very well in the debates because Martin is going to keep attacking Bernie @ColoredSpaces <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
338 Nice subliminal messaging ABC. Its pretty obvious youre showing that graphic to try to make Sanders look like an unelectable candidate. First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you. Then you win. Mahatma Gandhi <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie shouldnt have to defend himself on this. Being pro gun is a progressive issue, especially since most gun laws were put in to prevent poor people from owning guns. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is very right when he says although not in this particular interview that early polls are heavily skewed by name recognition. Once the primary actually starts and more people learn about Bernie and what he stands for itll be a far closer race that Bernie could very well win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Interesting to see how basically all the questions the interviewer asks Bernie is about social issues, and nothing about economic issues. Wonder why that is....cough CORPORATE MEDIA. If you are watching this and dont agree with any of his stands on social issues, please dont be fooled to vote against your own best interests just because of that! The Rich and powerful wants a weak and divided labor force that cannot challenge them! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My black and latino brothers and sisters really everyone, please learn more about Bernie. Hes not the typical white man from the goodoldboys club. Hes genuinely progressive, and will fight for legislation that will help not only every american, but in particular communities which suffer inordinately in terms of unemployment and taxation. Hes your candidate. Hillary is bad for us, anyone on the right is bad for us regardless their color. #BernieSanders2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is courageous. All of his supporters need to spread the word about him as widely as possible, especially among women and people of color. We can beat big money the only thing that can stop him from winning is idleness. #feelthebern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If there is a God I dont believe one exists, personally PLEASE let Bernie win. Hes one of the few sincere people in politics he doesnt use rhetoric and party line spin shit that has turned that enterprise into a disaster. His views are not for votes or catchphrases, theyre literally what he stands for. And for those who decry socialism, I hope you plan on not using any of that Medicare or Medicaid in your lifetime those are literally programs of socialism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary Clinton voted to invade Iraq in 2003 when she was in the Senate. Bernie Sanders helped lead the opposition to the Iraq War. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant help but be suspicious of Bernie Sanders, if only because the mainstream media is giving him attention and putting him in the spotlight instead of ignoring him and blacking him out, as you would expect them to do with a truly antiestablishment candidate that threatens the corporate elite. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All I saw were happy people talking about their lives I didnt learn anything about Clintons policies. I cant find her postelection plan anywhere. The commercial said Vote for me, my last name is Clinton. Bernie Sanders 2016! His plan and policies are well known. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie makes SO many false arguments and lies. Listening to this, I wrote down 9 points against his platform and 1 point against Hilary that he so nicely pointed out. Not a fan of how Robert Reich. He views people as citizens, rather than consumers and investors. This is Totally against the idea of the free individual. E Pluribus Unum dude. Not the other way around.

I think Bernie really has a shot. I think a lot of people are tired of Republicans AND Democrats, and see both parties as corrupted by big money. Bernie is a hippie at heart hes not going to pander to anyone or anything but whats truly right. Sanders all the way in my book. He may be running for the Dem nomination, but he is and always will be independent of the bipartisan machine. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BERNIE SANDERSLYING, ENTITLED, OLD, ANGRY WHITE PRIVLEGED MALE. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is a tard and will destroy our economy, if you raise taxes from say 15% to 90% for the rich. Then they will all leave so they can keep their money and you will get 90% of nothing. 15% of something 90% of nothing <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
George Stepa whatever is a clown. Listen to what Bernie is saying. Its true, and its not debatable. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need Bernie to win, not because he can singlehandedly solve all of our problems, but because he will actually bring the right messages and the right approach to politics to DC. What he says about needing a political revolution in the U.S. is so CLEARLY and PAINFULLY true that only weirdoes and assholes would stand against it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary who? Everyone does know Bernie Sanders is running for president right? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BERNIE SANDERS 2016!!!! Mr. Sanders is a no bullshit politician who actually cares. NO SUPERPAC! Look at his campaign contributors!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
GO BERNIE GO!!! 2016, BABY!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As an European I really really hope Bernie Sanders becomes President. I am sure most Europeans see it that way. America is a great country but the political system is shit. This guy seems to be the only way out. Lets hope that the money doesnt win and that this one time the people get heared. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie got more accomplished last week, by stopping 80 postal offices from closing. What has Malley done in the past year? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Can you guys nominate him please? I really want Jeb to win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its so funny how after they ask Bernie a question about Hillary they start showing a bunch of pictures of her, because they want him to start saying negative things about her. But he just starts talking about the real issues, and so the pictures of Hillary that they are showing look totally out of place. ABC News should be ashamed of calling themselves journalists. #bernie2016 #feelthebern #berniesanders #hillaryclinton <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Omalley is another fake. Sanders will actually help the people a lot more. OMalley has a much bigger ego. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes just saying what Bernies saying in a less effective way. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OMalley is the best candidate in my opinion. His proven progressive track record proves hes not just a whistle blower like Clinton. I like Bernie, but he cant win at his age and as an independent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everyone volunteer! We need to work together in order to win. We need to take back America, of which we all should have an equal share in it democracy and Bernie will help give you that right back. #Berniecanlead2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hillarys top donor is Citibank. Who do you think she serves? She openly stumps for Monsanto a company doing all it can to destroy our species. Bernie doesnt take the megacorps money.

Wow, like a godsend. So sad that these ideas supporting the middle class, healthcare and education for american citizens, are considered radical and that Bernie will have an uphill struggle to pass moderate socialist ideas that are working beautifully in other countries. So sad America is wallowing in our own radical conservatism and bigotry. Lets get Bernie on the ticket! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

ABC News Youtube channel chose a title inspired by the hosts words He wants America to look more like Scandinavia, right after he said I can hear the republican attack ad right now. Does ABC News have a republican bias? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If Bernie were elected, I would hope he would keep his promise of making the U.S. more like Norway first by lowering corporate taxes to 28% from 35%, and second by abolishing any taxes on inherited wealth and personal property, just as Norway did in 2014. If only we could be more like Norway. sigh... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If this man is on the Democratic ticket Im going to put my biased beliefs aside about voting and cast my ballot for him.

750,000 Americans died in the Civil war to keep this great country from splitting in two. 450,000 died in WWII to save Europe and the world from tyranny.

Bernie Sanders is a part of the problem. He is so ignorant when it comes to economics and is pure politician. He has nothing but talking points. I could own him in a debate. The reason why Sanders is running is because he is 73 years old. If he wins he has a job for 4 years, if not he retires. In both cases he wins. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If Bernie wins the Democratic primary, he will have my vote. If not, the Greens have me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
YES, BERNIE, YES!!!!! AMERICA NEEDS YOU. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie vs Hillary hmm... Bernie all the fucking way <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is refreshing to find a candidate that have the leadership to be firm and at the same time modest. Who held firm the core principle of social justice that he would not run away from it even if it is a social taboo. BRAVO BERNIE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Make no mistake, if you vote Republican in 2016, you are voting for a corporate dictatorship. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He wont win, but he seems to be a better choice than most. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Simple I vote for you when you let men be with men, women be with women, when you fix the economy, and let me keep my guns <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BERNIE 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That Washington post reporter in the blue jacket was the only one offering good analysis. Bernie needs to be treated like the honest candidate that he is. The Democrats deserve to choose their candidate for themselves not be told to vote for Hillary. I for one will choose to vote for Bernie and urge everyone to hear him out before deciding who to vote for in the Democratic primaries. Also, everyone should donate what they can to berniesanders.com and help him get the exposure he needs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Amazing how fucked this country has become when Socialism isnt demonized the minute is leaves this Tyrants mouth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Man, he just sounds so authentic. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If only Sanders had a chance. Big coorporations an billionaires all over the US will throw money at all other candidates. Money is the thing that elects a president, not the US people. Very sad. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im voting Bernie Sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im by no means a Democrat or Republican but I would much rather see Rand Paul or Bernie Sanders win over Bush or Clinton <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not underestimating Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Glad to see Bernie Sanders mentioned. Ill be tuning in more if he isnt ignored by the media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The reason I would vote for Bernie Sanders is because of the honesty. No other politician would EVER say that America should look more like Scandinavia. I absolutely respect that and he speaks the truth. Unfortunately, the media is going to fuck him over for ratings and the Republicans will just keep throwing out the word socialist to demonize him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hilary is bullshit!! A moderate corporate republican at best. Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If we elect another bush or Clinton then it proves this country is a fucking aristocracy of the rich. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

bernies the cooliearabs trash. Bernies the MATZAjew goat. he will never WIN... BERNIES IS A GOAT FOR THE POOR TO RIDE...INTO A DEAD CARIBBEAN DUMP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hillary sucks and is surrounded by scandals. Bernie Sanders for President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why isnt the Benghazi Panel approaching the NSA for Hillarys emails? Isnt NSA supposed to collaborate and work on issues of American Safety. Americans were killed ... arent they supposed to provide associated data that was collected by them. Or are they just going to sit there as if they dont exist? Just because there is a high ranking politician involved in this case? Are government tools supposed to be used only to hammer down the common citizens? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
vote for Bernie Sanders. He stands with the American citizens. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is the perfect candidate to challenge Hillary Inc. The Queen of Wall Street. Let 2016 be a referendum on pay for play politics and the 1% owned government. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders is most definitely a better selection than Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I didnt know of bernie sanders... but am beginning to really like the guy! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I support Bernie Sanders but he has no chance against the powerful Clinton machine. Hillary Clinton is a true Republican at heart. She will continue the policies of George W. Bush. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dis nigga Hillary fake as fuck! She hided her E mails and got a nigga raped in Libya. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For the love of God, if you vote for Hillary dont freakin vote for her just because shes a woman, just like you shouldnt have voted for Obama just because hes black! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
too many immigrants in this video. 1010 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I rather have her as president than any republican! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thanks Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We live in a sick world. People are going to blindly vote for her because she is a woman, or a Clinton. Or because shes a democrat. But these kids that vote have no idea what the difference in democrats and republicans are. People need to be educated, no one should be allowed to vote unless they are completely educated about these politics. Vote for Rand Paul, not this bitch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

When Hillary Clinton loses the run for president and falls to the bedrock of hell, will she understand the difference it made. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary has proven herself to be Republican Light. Progressive voters have proven they will not vote for Republican Light. Therefore, Hillary cant win the primary, let alone the presidency. There are more independent voters than either registered Democratic voters or Republican voters. Add the progressive Democratic votes to the independent votes and Bernie Sanders gets enough Electoral Votes to win the presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

GO HILLARY! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If she gains control say goodbye to America and a big welcome back to the nazi era. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary thinks its perfectly okay to spend almost 3 billion on her campaign. This means getting megamillions from rich and powerful people and Wall Street. At least Bernie Sanders is actually saying hes concerned about that, for Gods sake. Is she really that hungry for power? Yes, she is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This guy is good! He is dialed in. I doubt his proposals would ever amount to any real change, but he definitely has a better sense of the pulse of American than Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You people realize she didnt have anything to do with making the video. She payed big bucks to have the ad hit all the races and discreetly throw in gay couples. She knows that stupid people will see that and think that is what she cares about. All she cares about is becoming president and she will make up all the lies and bullshit to get her there. She is such a bitch I cant believe people buy this crap. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillarys slogan What difference does it make? This video is offensive if anything, to almost everyone. It stereotypes. And it does nothing. I expect nothing more from the Official senate panty dropper. Perhaps you should earn your occupation from having actual skills and not just having a boyfriend in that occupation??? Oh, and nice one becoming senator of a place youve never even lived in before. Terrible and you make the U.S. into a joke by simply existing, Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary could dig up the Benghazi victims and BBQ them and feed them to preschoolers in the Rose Garden with Obama serving the potato salad......and I dont give one single solitary fuck. Im voting for Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont buy it. Suddenly shes all about equal opportunity and helping the lower and middle class and behind our backs shes probably still receiving campaign donations from Goldman Sachs. Shes never faught against wallstreet and the 1% and now she pretends like she cares. I wish Warren was running. One of the few actual progressives in congress. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

what the hell happened to him at 519 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
shes just another corporate democrat. not much better than any other republican. bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are the only rational choices ive seen so far. lets get some real progressives in the white house for a change. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand Paul, NO. Ted Cruz, NO. Marco Rubio, NO. Anyone else the GOP is gonna put up? So far, none of them stand a chance in 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im getting ready to do something too... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am joining Hillary our country needs to move FOWARD AND NOT BACK. Hillary ALL THE WAY IN 2016 AND 2020 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Now everybody collectively join me in crossing my fingers that Elizabeth Warren, an actual liberal, will decide to run. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ohhh shit just got real!!! I voting for her for the same reason I voted for Obama, just to see the firsts female president all candidates are full of shit no republican and no democrat will really make a change <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She already has my vote. HillaryWarren 2016! Defeat The sexist racist republicans.GO HILLARY! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am soo for a female president, just maybe not Hilary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The first election Ill be able to vote in isnt looking as good as I hoped. Obviously I wouldnt vote for the Republicans, simply because theyre a despicable party attacking the poor and minorities alike, and offering no actual policies that work. However, voting for a Corporate Democrat isnt my first choice, but it might have to do if a figure like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren cant take ticket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A VOTE FOR HILLARY IS A VOTE FOR BILLY. BRING BACK PROSPERITY. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If anyone supports her, their voting because of her sex and not because theyve actually been paying attention to her accomplishments. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant stand Hillary or her supporters. Ill take Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren ANY DAY ANY TIME. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT TO RUN SUCK ASS, WE NEED AN OUTSIDER WITH A NEW VISION NOT THE SAME OLD POLITICS ITS SO PATHETIC, THE TRUTH IS NO ONE COMES TO MIND. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Another innocent person shot dead for driving. These NSA agents should be arrested immediately for murder. They had no right to shoot this unarmed man, and each and every one of them is a coward.

BERNIE SANDERS FOR PRESIDENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Nothing wrong with Petra, but I cant believe her father gave her so much money at such a young age. Especially when she says Like, I got a really great deal. Shes not buying a bargain handbag.

If you dont want your son to be shot by cops, I suggest you not raise a thug. Karma came for Michael Brown at a rather young age.

Look at all the movie stars that had financial troubles and the public becomes HYPERCRITICAL about them. They make big bucks and then they are broke. People dont understand.

This is very misleading and misinformation media reporting on the part of ABC. I am not a rep from Herbalife but I can tell you this that the company has helped millions of people get healthy and make an income. Also, pyramid schemes are illegal so the issue that Herbalife is having on behave of making medical claims should be blamed on some of the distributors who are doing it not the company. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I had the privilege of hanging out with Linda back in the early 70s when I was hanging out with Bernie Leadon. I was a shy young thing and she always made sure to talk to me.

I dont get it, the One Percent get to rip off billions from the Ninetynine Percent and just get a slap on the wrist and pay a fine. When will our country stop protecting only the privileged few and be a real Democracy where you dont have to be soulless bastard to live a dignified life. Bernie got it right he ripped off only those consumed by greed, a very easy mark! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Uh Dumbass, Maddoff Ripped off superwealthy people, IMHO that is great because as it is now the same Superweatlhy people rip us off daily and you dumbass MORONS dont say a damn thing about the Corzines of MF Global getting away scott free but ohhhhh the poor Maddoff victims.I say give Bernie a slap on the back. You rip off the poor there is no penalty but dont rip off the rich like Bernie or you will be punished. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No matter how you feel about him personally, the president is of course absolutely correct here and backed by the entire Civil War historical community. Everything stemmed from the slavery issue, James McPherson The war was ABOUT slavery. Cattons emphasis Slavery had caused it If slavery had vanished before 1861, the war simply would not have taken place. Bruce Catton, Reflections on the Civil War p5 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the stories are rather conflicting. the brothers and mother recount a story of bernie confronting his sons first with the sons not having the faintest suspicion of what was happening, not of mark calling his dad out based on suspicion. iunno. weird. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It is hard to believe his wife did not know about Bernies crimes while they were unfolding. She even withdrew 15 million just prior to the collapse of the scheme. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

America is already great, Bernie just wants to improve it while making life for the middle and lower classes more rewarding. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Noticed on CBS evening news tonight 11 9 15 where the network is saying things to discount Bernie Sanders and elevate Hillary. Always remember NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, and Fox are billionaire owned. And Hillary is a paid off puppet for these people. Bernie wants to tax the sht out of them. The people are more informed now and have a better perspective. Bernie WILL be our next President. And the corporate shills in Congress will go away over the next few years. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Someone at the Union Pacific company, trusted with the authority to make a safe decision, instead chose risk and profit above safety. Now they have lost both profit and safety.

I know this will get scrubbed but here goes. Bernie Sanders won every online poll after the debate.

Trump and his supporters are like Nazis and should be dealt with like Nazis. Healthcare to immigrants? Only if you consider American citizens immigrants since no one in the debate said anything about giving illegal immigrants these things.

The problem with his statements is hes saying that Bernie is going to tax the average person at 90%. Bernie is only taxing the top 1% i.e. Donald Trump himself at 90%. The taxes for the average taxpayer will go DOWN under Bernies policies. Its time Donald Trump understands the difference between Socialism, communism, and Social Democracy the latter being what Bernie actually stands for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie wants to tax billionaires at 90%. YouTube Bernie at one of his rallies. Then go to berniesanders.comissues. Now tell me after that what you think of Sanders. Is he really a crazy nut or will he lead us out of the hole billionaires have shoved us into? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Democrats have gone completely and utterly insane. I couldnt believe what the hell I was hearing at that debate. We are in debt up to our eyeballs and these freaks want to give free tuition and healthcare to illegals? WHAT THE F is that??? Why the fuck are they kissing the asses of PEOPLE WHO AINT EVEN SUPPOSE TO BE IN THE COUNTRY?? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Socialism is the government ownership of all means of productions like companies. That flys to the face of the Constitution. Does Bernie believes in that? Then he is a Communist Socialist like Castro. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump, regarding Sanders. Please. Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Its not the 50s anymore. People got their rose colored glasses about the free market knocked off their heads in 2008. Bernie understands the dialectic. #feelthebern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie sanders reminds me of FDR <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I never thought I would say the day a real Progressive would have a real chance, I think Bernie winning because people know we are looking at the abyss in so many areas, climate, the eradication of the middle class, the standard of living, income inequality mostly due to breaks giving to the 1% while the working manwoman carries the burdens, foreign entanglements. Yes this awesome and sorry Trump Bernie is going to knock that smirk off your face. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump, the man with no substance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im willing to bet the only blacks in the building, who were probably plants, were strategically placed behind Trump to try and convince us he has the support of minorities. Nice try! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Bernie is just waiting for Trump to call him Bernie Uncle Joe Stalin Yeah Trump, the old man with the Einstein type unkempt white hair is cloaking the commie Uncle Joe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump is a beast. Too funny. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Guess Bernie didnt offer a good enough bribe. But did members agree or was it just the Union heads that decided sans the input of the rank and file. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie won... no question. .. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow fuck this guy, Bernie has said multiple times how he plans to pay for free college by taxing wall street speculation. Not to mention the money for most of Bernies plans is already there it just needs to be re allocated from the current failed policies into the new policies. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie owned that debate, It wasnt even close, hell everybody else on that stage was just desperate looking. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Could be. I dont think so, I believe it will be a Bernie boost, judging by all the polls Ive seen online and even CNNs. I just knew the media would insist on Hilary, attempting to convince the audience of this by stating it on the title. Washington Post, Huffington Post, Guardian, all are doing this as well as of this comment. All I see is Hilary. Lets wait and see the numbers. Damn deceptive titles. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
AP your corporate bias is showing lol. Bernie owned that debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clinton boost? What the hell was the AP watching? Bernie crushed it. Dont be afraid of the Bern. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This shit is beyond fucking rigged. Every single poll with the exception of Daily Kos had Bernie destroying Shillary by like 80% to 70%, WTF is the media talking about??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
CNNs own polls showed Bernie Sanders dominated every aspect of that debate, but it appears no one in the media can accept that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Nothing Hillary Clinton could do or say would induce me to vote for her. I dont trust her because she changes positions based on polling, not based on her heart or her head. I trust Bernie Sanders to do the right thing and to search for the right thing. I also agree with him 95% of the time. Its Bernie or bust, for me and a whole lot of others. #FeelTheBern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump has been running for president for decades. So why now are people finally taking him seriously. Because he came out and said racist shit against minorities. He has no plan. No idea what the hell he is even talking about. When asked a question, he quickly changes the subject or claims he has people to handle it for him. Youre giving the election to Bernie Sanders. And I thank you for that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump tries to be as mean as possible, exaggerate as much as possible and lie as much as possible. He is totally manipulating his supporters and they dont even notice. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The group ought to be honest and call themselves ONLY Black Lives Matter cause they sure dont give a Dmn about anyone else. They could have set up anywhere and advertised their OWN Rally, but NO they had to hijack Bernies Audience cause nobody wanted to hear from them! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
.. bernie lets 3 Sheboons run off him off the stage .. imagine wat all the other countries will do if he is elected S <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

#berniesanders2016 read and know his position and what hes about is the substance go Bernie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders marched with Martin Luther King, was arrested on a march to oppose apartheid, campaigned for Jessie Jackson in 88, is continually making the public aware of the problem of high black unemployment, and is fighting for more educational opportunities for children in poor communities. The protestors in this video are a disgrace to their cause, a disgrace to African Americans, a disgrace to the nation, a disgrace to everyone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernies message is resonating with what Americans truly believe, we can create a new America. The Billionaires cant have it all! #FeelTheBern #WeStandTogether <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
at least no feral animals interrupted this time... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this POS bitch funds the feral animals calling themselves #blacklivesmatter, she is targeting Bernie Sanders the only politican who cares about the middle and lower classes. this wonen needs to be stopped this time for good, I really would love to see her retire into failure. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders has been fighting for race equality long before any of these shitstained kids left their daddies balls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Actually look at what Bernie sanders stands for before you make ur judgment he has a set of principles hes run on his entire life he marched with mlk in the 60s hes always stood up for the people hes the only genuine person their #berniesanders2016 lets do this <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow Okay I just loss all respect for black lives matter! They are too aggressive seriously pushing and screaming, Bernie Sanders even said okay go ahead but they threaten to shut it down we will let you speak he even said, that one girl is pushing and pushing is that how you want to represent your cause? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A choice between a Corrupt Politician Hillary Clinton or Socialist Bernie Sanders? Thats easy TRUMP 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its theater! If there no industry there is no social programs. Wait, isnt this the guy who got shouted down by the black lives matter crowd? lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So now at least MSM is mentioning the rallies and crowds. Pretty hard to ignore. And yet the establishment continues to say in every article coming out that crowds dont translate to votes. That theres no way anyone can run without a super pac ya da ya da ya da. They STILL dont get it! Bernie is creating such a political paradigm shift in this country the political establishment dinosaurs are going to fall into the cracks of the earthquake it creates. And after? DEMOCRACY! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bernie sanders a communist so called jew son of satan <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Those women are ridiculous! They obviously havent done their research on who Bernie Sanders is and what he has done for the African American community. They must have thought they were doing something great by interrupting Mr. Sanders speech and advocating for the black lives matter movement, but little did they know at that time that they would end up making fools and savages of themselves. Absolutely disrespectful and unnecessary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Black lives matter doesnt give you the right to do whatever the hell you want. Shes treating Bernie like hes a piece of shit and like his life doesnt matter. This is insane. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Bernie gets pushed around like this by his own. Just imagine what Putin or ISIS would do to him. No leader in him whatsoever. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Cant say he didnt have it coming. Upper class white progs pander to thugs and hustlers, not surprising that the chickens come home to roost. Expect more of the same. Id like to see the Black Lies Matter crowd try to disrupt a Donald Trump event. That would be good TV, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
O my...man i hope the activist would apologize...I mean yes, black lives matter but Bernie is helping their progressive movement..Protest should be done in the right way or your just going to make yourself more enemies.D <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont know whats worse, these protestors hijacking Bernies event, or Bernie letting them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Those women should have been spartan kicked off the stage but since it was only Bernie Sanders, who really cares.. Actually think they should be hired to be at Hlllarys next campaign rally... Bwaaaa! Haaaa! Haaaa! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BLM needs to do this to hillary, not bernie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Bernie Sanders, but the girls in this video really make me wish Donald Trump was there. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Given the circumstances, Bernie handled that with class. But I feel he could have done a bit more by capitalizing on the situation and give his stance on racial issues. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am not understanding this movement. I grew up in a melting pot, Morriistown , NJ, graduated 1986 and the town has and had every nationality on the planet and we were all friends! This is bullshit! ALLLLL LIVES MATTER AND These are not true activists. I believe George Soros pays then to do this stuff! I wanna honor soldiers lives who died fighting so that dumb bitch has a voice to bother people and get away with it! this is bullshit and I dont like Bernie Sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie burned by Progressives. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Stupidity, not how you hold assembly. hijacking someone elses event isnt helping.. I wont support that BS. GO assemble outside a court office, police office ect. Bernie is not the enemy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Sanders is a pussy bitch Wheres his fucking balls? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Isnt black lives matter funded by Soros? Not sure he cares so much than about keeping the masses at each others throats <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie for door mat 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I challenge Bernie Sanders to give a speech to an audience that is more than 50% POC. He cant do it. He cant relate. He is the whitest of the white. Thats why POCs dont like him. Bernie is a senator from Vermont. Facts about Vermont 95.3% white 1.5% Hispanic 1.3% Asian 1.0% black Do I smell mayonnaise? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is a liberal who just got mugged! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Undisciplined, Aggressive, black Bitches Fuck Bernie Sanders Again! Ha! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Are they singling Bernie out? He has been targeted at least once before. I havent seen any other candidates targeted. Sounds like the black lives matter is a conservative movement. I thought I was in agreement with the goals of the movement, but now Im not sure. Im definitely not a conservative and black lives matter seems kind of conservatives to me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Power to the Sheeple! Bernies antiNWO rhetoric must be stopped! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why the FUCK did these stupid imbeciles disrupt Bernie Sanders at his own event? I feel sorry for Bernie for having to deal with these fucking morons. The BlackLivesMatter movement is an embarrassment if this is how theyre going to conduct themselves. Bernie Sanders 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He thanks the city for being progressive and then the progressives show what theyre all about. Sorry to say this, but those are the people Bernie fights for. #alllivesmatter <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why are black lives matter activists protesting Bernie Sanders? Bernie Sanders is against police brutality and is for the Black Lives Matter movement... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If they had just asked the events organizers to give them 10 minutes to speak, they would surely be allowed to do so. Why did they feel the need to do this? I am confused. Its like stealing food samples at the supermarket. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ok, youve had your 15minutes of infamy, now get off the stage and let Bernie speak. Long before you were born, Bernie spent his youth fighting segregation and marching with MLK for civil rights. Hes a perfect gentleman for forbearing your heckling. You should try it with one of the republikkkan candidates, see where that takes you. Pick your fights wisely. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Good. Bernie is a fraud. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow, what retarded, ignorant, wastes of intercourse! Well, I like Bernie, but he shouldnt have taken this disrespect. All lives matter, not just the black ones. Anyway, I wont be supporting the black lives matter movement because of douchebags like this and will now be voting for whichever white guy is going to be the most repressive to minorities. Way to go you ignorant fucks! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
That shows what a racist Bernie is. They were only allowed to speak because they were black. If white people tried that they would be arrested. Bernie was thinking let the nappy headed hoes speak before they put a whoopin on me, we do not want them to become violent and start making gorilla noises... He did not let them speak out of respect, it was fear. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Black Lives Matter is a Soros funded operation. Second time theyve shut down Bernie Sanders. Soros wants pro war Hitlary elected so he needs to shut down Bernie, just like DNC has been doing. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have a suggestion for Bernie. Wear a wireless Mic under his clothes. Have fake podium Mics for the Negroes to commandeer. Then while the Bozos are talking to dead Mics, just take a few steps away and continue the speech. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a fucking shitshow. Bernie handled it well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bernie sanders looks like a real honest nice guy actually . he really does .. and i hate his politics ... its anti capitalism .. but he is fair nice guy ... this is why people shit on liberals . and stupid groups like this they are annoying .. and disrespectful ... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
hahaha i love this , i love this . crazy liberals . going after crazy liberals ... i actually feel bad for bernie sanders .... haha makes me angry and happy at the same time <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Bernie Sanders office supervised starvation banning of groceries. Their position is that if you are black and have been banned for that reason from food, it is legal and cops may arrest you for trying to buy it. Also, he is defrauding rape victims and uses police brutality to back his lil crime ring up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont understand why the this group chooses to target Bernie Sanders, out of all the candidates. Can someone explain why? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How can you make me hate you more than a politician? Be an activist. I dont give a fuck what color you are. When you scream and yell, youve already lost the argument. Im sure there are a shit ton of black people that would like to see you taken down by a pack of wild hyenas just as much as myself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I have a strong feeling that Clintons campaign has hired this group to interrupt Bernie Sanders wherever he goes because theyre scared that hes catching up with her in the polls <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Disrupting Bernie Sanders and not letting him talk only reinforced every stereotype of Blacks...please stop making us look bad. This type of behavior does NOT help our cause! It only reinforces racist viewpoints people already have about us. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What I dont get is why they are targeting Bernie Sanders in particular. Why arent they going after Donald Trump as well and the other GOP hopefuls. Why Bernie? The way they are talking aka SCREAMING at Bernie and the organizers indicates this is kind of personal. Like its a vendetta for something they think hes done. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Haha! Black lives matter movement and Bernie sanders is a joke. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

How the fuck is the #blacklivesmatter movement supposed to gather support by constantly hijacking Bernies audience? Dont be surprised the day you find your campaign isolated from any support. You certainly lost mine. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Why didnt the dirty fat negroids do this at the Republican primary debates? Or at Donald Trump, Rand Paul, Chris Christie, or Ben Carson speech?

Go protest a Ben Carson speech they guy is black yet he does NOTHING for your cause. Dont be a fucking pussy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I like Bernie too, the only thing is I think education is only a second priority to a nation with NO industry anymore, and NO jobs. Like putting the horse before the cart. Maybe Im asking to much for a leader that can make this country what it once was when everything said made in the USA. Not complaining though, what difference does it make Hillary would be the farthest thing from ever restoring America. By all means the people need to vote Bernie in. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

18 trillion to help advance the American people or 20 trillion in the upcoming wars that all republicans and Hillary which seems like a Republican in a democratic mask want to wage. I rather my tax money go towards helping this country as opposed to dummy bombing and enriching the private corporations that prey on wars and lobby to reach their goals. how do some not see Bernie as the only reliable and sane nominee. bernies got ur back... will you have his? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

what a bunch of liars these Fox news reporters are she said we are not at war with Islam and it was verified all the attackers where French citizens and Trumps answer just arm everybody.

Bernie Sanders, are you kidding me? I was watching some Nuremberg trial footage of liberated concentration camps, after WW2! I found the footage of the bulldozers, pushing hundreds of dead bodys into mass graves particularly interesting. Remember Hitler was a SOCIALIST! Socialists have a funny way of implementing policy? Ya think! R.I.P. P.S. Americans need to take their diapers off and learn to care for themselves and their, own families! <#urls:0> <+emoji:1> <-emoji:0>

Bernie wont turn his back on the refugees now, and he had better not do it when he is in a dark alley with them after they get here. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The reason Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders want as many refugees coming into America as possible even if it means some are dangerous are for obvious and selfish reasons, these same refugees will always vote for the hands that fed them!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Um, no. Bernie Sanders did NOT say ISIS is a result of Global Warming. Its actually a result from Republicans like George Bush and people like you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obamas lack of action against ISIS, inability to refer to Islam extremists condemnation of his opponents are just some of the evidence Obama is complicitous with ISIS other Islamic terrorists group. In short Obama his goons Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid Bernie Sanders doesnt give a damn about America.

Bernie Sanders didnt say that Climate Change caused the Paris attack. He said Climate Change is the biggest threat to national security. Parts of the world are already experiencing food shortages and island population migrations due to sea level rise it is likely to get worse and destabilize large parts of the world. Now the fight is over oil and religion it will get much more vicious when we are fighting over food and water. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
strong performance that first debate??? yeah right? ?? Bernie won that first debate. and he brought it up because the TPP is evil. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fighting about the issues will benefit Ted Cruz who is correct on all issues.

The Republicans are the real terrorists with their antiAmerican rhetoric. They created ISIS. They are responsible for the death of American soldiers in Iraq. They are responsible for the massive debt from the Iraq war. Its time we hold the Republicans accountable for their actions and prosecute them for war crimes. The legacy of Barack Obama will be preserved and will not be tarnished. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
LMAO... Bernie Sanders at no time said that global warming caused the terrorist attacks... What he said was that climate change will add and increase terrorism as people begin fighting over finite resources such as water and farming land...

Trump is a fucking moron trying to make political gain from the deaths of the innocent,hes a fucking VULTURE ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We dont need more intervention in the middle east. Intervention is what created ISIS by getting rid of Saddam Hussein. What we need is SECURE BORDERS and DEPORTATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. That is also what Europe needs, and its also what France needs. People need to realize diversity isnt as great as people say it is, and it is exactly what caused the terrorism in France. BUILD A WALL AND DEPORT THEM ALL! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Bernie Sanders becomes the next president, all of the 1% people, would just leave. And they would build factories and corporations in other countries that would LOVE to have them and all the jobsopportunities they would bring. Good job liberals! you are fucking retarded. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its amazing that you guys cant seem to understand that Bernie Sanders doesnt go negative and he wins anyway. Do you understand that? It is what he has always done. I think this panel does show that republicans have no idea what democrats care about. Bernie actually said that our invasion of Iraq made this very much Americas problem because it directly led to ISIS. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So there was a massive terrorist attack and the main theme about it thru out the DNC debate was about how best to refer to the murderous swine that did the killing in the least offensive way......

Hilary is far from solidifying her support. Bernie is just toying with her. He doesnt want to be the front runner right now, just look at how much they come after you from all sides when you are the front runner. It is always better to be the underdog to stay under the radar in the early stage then overtake as you get closer to the finish line. This is just like the 2008 election when Hilary was running against Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie doesnt need to go after Hillarys emails because her record is bad enough. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Trump 2016 ...the only choice for America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
First Comment! Bernie 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is one of the best president of the United States of America. Lets not forget where we were 8 years ago. Only history will remember his hard work not the current republicans. His success is going to give another Democrat the presidency. Hillary or Bernie. FYI I voted for Bush and probably the worst mistake I ever did. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
carson is a damn liar and a weirdo <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She was trying to get him to say Bernie Sanders. lol hes so afraid to run against Bernie he didnt even say his name. instead he just says Biden. lol Bidens not even running, bud. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders needs to hop back in the Delorean, fire up the flux capacitor, and come back to reality! #trump2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Willing to bet there will be very little policy substance in this debate, and GOP candidates will avoid personal responsibility by blaming the moderators. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not one sane person on the republican side. Only Bernie seems to be a qualifying honest candidate for the presidency. Hillary is a robot that covers up for her molesting husband and she loves the banks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think Bernie will win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For those who believes in God, yes, God sent Trump and told him to service the people and country. Be noticeable and outspoken. For those who believed in evolution, how we evolved and acquired class and quality, we got Donald Trump always two steps ahead. For any reason VOTE FOR TRUMP 2016 !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie got it going on <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BERNIE SANDERS. BERNIE SANDERS. NON RELIGIOUS,. WANTS THE BEST FOR AMERICA. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BERNIE SANDERS 2016!! FEEL THE BERN!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hope Carson Runs....I would vote for him.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So he attacks his mother with a hammer and tried to stab a relative.... No normal human being does this.. He also denies the Theory of Evolution... Yeah, hes retarded.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wheres Ben Carsons birth certificate??? Why wont he just come out and show up in what country he was born? What do you have to hide, Benny? What an idiot. Show us your BIRTH CERTIFICATE, Benny! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson thinks the pyramids where used for grain storage lol this guy is a joke <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She is doing the woman thing to keep us from focusing on her anti middle class policies. She is pro TPP and pro NAFTA and anti 15 min wage, and anti free health care, and against increasing social security benefits. She is in bed with Wall Street billionaires. Believe me, women arent so stupid and uninformed as to vote for Hillary when they can vote for Bernie instead. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Always remember Fox News is owned by billionaires! The talking heads will say anything to turn us off to Bernie. They dont want Bernie as President. We DO! He will be our next President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Obama is the antichrist <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
either trump or carson is going to get the nomination. I have a feeling it is going to be ben <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
these candidates are becoming more and more comic, Ben Carson, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, seriously we really want these people to run the country? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is unelectable because of his denial of science. He rejects evolutionary theory. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders Gets The Highest Marks For Honesty And Integrity. Ben Carson Is Second, But Thats In The Stupid And Crazy Category. Silly Fox News. Always Getting It Wrong. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is a sociopath who southern hicks are flocking to because they view him as a reformed black man and one of the good ones. It reinforces the notion that black men are inherently violent and the only way they can better themselves is through Jesus and hard work. Donald Trump is the only man who can save America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bill OReilly has been lying to the American public for so long that when he writes a book on history the knee jerk reaction of most people is bullshit anyway. FOX NEWS Fear mongering <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson is creepy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It disgusts me that The View can get away for this. Comments on anyones looks, from your hair to your face, should be left to political comics, not to actual discussions. Especially when our country is so fundamentally split on real issues like abortion, immigration, and other things it pains me to see people from either party have to take time out of their campaign to defend against smiling as a joke to lighten the mood at a debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even conservatives think Carson is looney toons <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It makes me feel good how threatened Fox seems to be by Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders, 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why do republicans believe that ignorance and stupidity are virtues? Im NOT being sarcastic. I truly want to know. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie sanders 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is simply carbon taking up space on this earth ! Disgusting piece of garbage going around spreading his hate speech! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He is a liar though. Yes others have lied, but Carson is no different. This guy cant even give a straight answer to policy questions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This country is broken because its people have become a bunch of entitled, celebrityworshiping, politicalcorrectnessobsessed, realitytvwatching crybabies. America has become one giant vagina on the face of the earth. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow. This is just pathetic. Wonder how much he paid her. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if you people vote republican cause you think they are the party of jesus, you are not true followers of what jesus taught. bernie sanders is closer to what jesus wanted than anyone else running for president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Love it Fox Cops abuse power? No problem. Kids make a good point to racist retard? Horror! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Faux News at its finest. Bernie never said Hillarys emails werent an issue, he just believes that the people want to discuss the issues that impact their lives, not discuss her emails 247, while student debt continues to increase and people have poor healthcare. Hes said from the beginning theres an investigation that is ongoing, and it should continue. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Still looking for a mentally sane Republican candidate for presidency ? Somehow i think we need to understand that such a thing does not exist anymore <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BEN CARSON 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He never had a change of heart... He never said that the investigation should not continue. He just believes we should discuss the ISSUES that effect the American people, and let the investigation take its course. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Solid, honest man. Just what are country needs. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
donald trump or bernie sanders everyone should vote for because there not corrupt or bought like the other candidates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Damn straight Trump is leading. He has way more supporters at his rallies and way more supporters online. So stop trying to fool people. Plus who the hell likes Hitlery? No one! Yet they claim she is beating Bernie, but everyone thinks she is a liar and bad mouths her. #Veterans4Trump #Trump4President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why do you investigate a politic??? Is it because she is a female but if it was one of the male politics nooo you would leave it alone!!!!

Theres absolutely no reason to believe that lowering taxes creates jobs. No statistical data supports that claim. its absolute nonsense. A flat tax puts the burden on the lower and middle class anyway. Its complete crap. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It is so much fun watching the Republican party implode before our very eyes. I will never have to suffer another Republican president in my lifetime at this rate.

@samuelson joe Trump talks policy all the fucking time lmao let me ask you has Bernie talked policy? Lol just as much as the other politicians. critics of Trump are true grade a dumbasses <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Anytime I want a laugh I turn on fox news <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bernie definitely did the best but the important thing is bernies been saying the same thing for years hillary is now saying what bernies saying because bernie started polling ahead of hillary she is just full of shit period look at their records then vote im sure you will agree with me BERNIE the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh brother, here we go again with Donald Duck and Ass kissing Hannity. Man Hannity got his head so far up Trump ass that he cant see any daylight. This guy only put out negative ideals and statement.. Im loving it, lmao, its so cool that they are tearing each other apart with this clown leading the way and then cry about other attacking him as he always throw the 1st stone. Really Trump? President Obama is right, these guys Sucks!!! Hillary 2016 all the way <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hmmm President Obama has been on Fox News .. lol Bill O Riely during the Super Bowl? twice I recall. So Ben n Hannity are wrong as always and lying to their Viewers.. Nice Try, but we Got Ya!! Hilary n Bernie for 2016... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Gotta get Trump in the office. Carson as VP. Originally I thought Carson would be better but then I thought of Trumps character and skill. We need better relations, and a strong leader. While Carson may be strong in other areas, Trump is a business, and America honestly is sort of a business. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
dumbass Bernie Sanders thinks only black lives matters fucking idiot <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ive never voted before because the corruption of the entire process was so blatant. But I have to vote this time. To remind those bastards that we the people have the power. I have to vote for Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The press has never done anything but kiss Obamas ass. Hes never got any heat from his buttsuckers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im voting for Donald Trump for President. Trump is very smart.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If skewing the polls by leaving out key demographics helps you sleep at night, Faux...! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ben Carson doesnt accept evolution nor climate change and this man is a brain surgeon??? These two things are taught as evidential facts in any high school class, surely? I hope the more intelligent Republicans vote for Bernie Sanders. Cant we just vote for the best person for the job regardless of which party they are in. After a bit of research I found Bernie to be by far the most qualified and his vision past and present spot on. Exactly who we need to lead the free world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have no doubt these are dishonest polls results. The only polls Im looking forward to are the voter polls. BERNIE SANDERS 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Another Clinton in office is not gonna happen with the Republican voters, just like no more Bush is gonna happen with Democrat voters, Its Bernie and Trump for the election by all the people I talk to. Oh thats right, voting is a formality and the election has already been done by the 1%. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox News is scared of Hillary and Bernie. They know the end of the Republican party is coming up in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Keep whining, come election day im voting for hillary because she is pro life and supports reproductive rights. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They lie about Carson beating Trump... they lie about Hillary beating Sanders... I see fox isnt even pretending to have credibility anymore. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Please! The FIX IS IN even is Sanders led by 95% points hed go the same way as Ron Paul no where bc the systems serves Corporations the Elite now we the people., however.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everyone I talk to says they think Trump will win. I ask outside my own circles and get the same answers. Most of my friends are Democrat and they are voting Trump when the time comes to vote....

Bernie blew it and kissed Hillarys ass. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, shes a hardcore socialist, with military isolationism, and nationalizing the banks. Most Americans wont jump on board with that but Bernie, is a bit more pragmatic in his socialist views, and I think they could work. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Id sooner vote Trump over Hilary... but I still have my fingers crossed for Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bush is the one who really should be in jail for starting the Iraq war and the hundreds of thousands who died because of it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I can only watch about 10 seconds on fox when I start to throw up. What horrible, horrible people. If ANY of those on the right win the Oval Office, all programs and departments will be gone. The oligarchy will take everything and we will be a big war machine for taking over the rest of the world. Id say the only hope for America would be Bernie sanders, but they wont elect him. Im not being insulting, but Im absolutely amazed at the stupidity of the American voter. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is the only candidate for the people in this race. Ben Carson should get questioned about his book deal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I like how they dont mention Bernie sanders who is leading in both New Hampshire and Iowa. They didnt claim that Hilary was leading they just compared her numbers to the other candidates so they werent lying but they omitted Sanders from the polls in general....very interesting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think moderators should be independent...and if everyone noticed the c nbc mods told trump his tax plan would cost 10 trillion but wall street journal made that up along with bernie wanting to spend 18 trillion. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The number one driving force behind Trump is the FACT that he is NOT a politician. Im sick of politicians. Im sick of RINOs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Those questions were very relevant it is the answers that do not apply. they all LIE if their mouths are moving rep.democrat either way they ALL are full of crap try being honest an honest politician would have my vote <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

i think those were very pertinent questions, most of the republican candidates are retards Ben carson retarded creationist that would amplify the war on drugs the fat guy with black hair his simply retarded hilary clinton war criminal needs to be executed then are the others who dont matter the best candidates are bernie sanders who will win along with trump <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Liberals will be skeptical of Carson telling the truth about that Homepage deal saying hes a liar. Yet theyll probably support Hillary if shes the nominee the woman that was caught lying? Done. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why because shes a woman? STOP playing the gender card you need more than to be a woman <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I probably favor trump the most currently, but the gop has several candidates I definitely would not mind seeing as the new potus. Fiorina is one of those that I wouldnt mind seeing. Even if she doesnt win the nomination she needs to have a seat at the top and they need to bring her ideas. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bernie sandlers for president yay <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These republican debates are very funny and entertaining. Just give the job to Hilary Clinton already. We all know she is the most qualified to be president. And make Bernie the vicepresident and I guarantee the US will be an amazing nation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders is losing in every state except New Hampshire. Im not sure how he thinks that will win him the nomination, but I liked him a lot more before he started being a dick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am muslim born not religious Trump supporter and I consider myself progressive but I am not offended by Dr Carson, he seems like a genuinely great guy. The liberal left hates Dr Carson because they cant stand an honest black man who could think for himself, they hate his guts. You dont call these liberals progressives, they are, if anything racists and regressives. A TrumpCarson ticket would be a dream come true for me. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You know why Fox News has such beautiful women on their network? So us men will be staring at them instead of listening carefully to the baloney they spew. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The first, the second, the third and so on debates really dont matter what the main stream media has to say.. Promise politicians talk is just that, ALL TALK!! my mind has been made up because we dominated in last year November midterm elections and We the people got nothing in return Im Voting for Trump because the man a success on whatever he does, and he TALKS THE TALK AND WALKS THE WALK! Sincerely, Fox and other main stream really pulls for the Rinos or Clintons.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why would he, Bernie is going to run with her as her VP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well this interview was asinine, but the little good it may do is to delineate the difference between the kind of socialism for which Bernie advocates and the kind with which Fox tries to scare its viewers. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
thats what happens when you hear the truth truth can not be denied BERNIE SANDERS the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth BERNIE FOR 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why would you dedicate the title of this video to Bernie Sanders when all you did was debate policy with someone who has completely different views than him ? Seems to me like youre taking advantage of short attention spans, fox news. Manipulating your viewers perception of Sanders leaving him not creditable. Disgusting. Why dont you debate possible solutions to the actual issues America faces instead of this shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
that chick is a complete idiot. she obviously didnt realize it was wayched nore thean the Republican debate and Bernie slaughterd the polls <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bill gates says socialism is better than capitalism. In terms of Climate, Education, Innovation, and healthcare. Because those things shouldnt be profit based systems for corporations. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Carson is so effing boring.All he ever talks about is religion! What the fuck are they thinking??? If Carson wins Im voting Bernie Sanders just to make the fucking Bible Thumpers suffer even more. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I personally think the republicans should be less worried about each other and more worried about the democrats. i.e. Bernie Sanders, a communist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie has simply been drawing a contrast between them on the issues. She decided to attack. He has used the shouting about guns in several speeches prior to the debates, it was not a new line and was not directed at Hillary in the manner she is suggesting. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Listening to Fox and these Republican comments below makes me feel like a freakn genius. Bernie 2016!!! Wake up people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I seriously hope Carson or Trump wins the GOP nomination. It will be hilarious to watch Bernie or Hilary trounce them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its a travesty we have people spouting creation running for the President. Carson as well as the majority of the GOP need to go back to caves. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Im starting to see Fox News as a cancer trying to brain wash people with there opinions thats wrong. There against Bernie Sanders, Fox News support republicans and Fox News dont care about the struggling American people who are trying to survive. Its all one sided. Fox News is ruthless thugs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is leading in New Hampshire by 13 percent and losing in Iowa by three. Without Joe. I think the media is corrupt and siding with Clinton. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox you are aware you have pulls putting Bernie Sanders well above hillary? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Clinton took the gloves off when she accused Bernie as being a sexist. Bernie is a true independent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You guys seem to have overlooked the fact that Bernie is way ahead of where Obama was at this point in 2007. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary the Junke and Bernie the Jew. Screw all of them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Iowa does not let Trump win. Im voting Bernie just to make them suffer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He who defends Black lives matter is making political suicide. Ben Carson has to not alienate the white voters no matter what his actual view is on the matter. Compare this to Bernie Sanders who declared out loud that Black lives matter. He ignore the harm that will make to his chances of getting elected and stand by what he believes in. Bernie had fought for the Blacks even as a college student. In terms of character, no candidate is his equal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Hillary is nominated, I will turncoat the democrats, and vote republican. Yeah, it would be going against my own best interests, but if sanders doesnt win, then its proof that America is fucked and cant be fixed. So, democrats, dont be stupid. Vote Bernie in the primaries, or look forward to President Donald Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Bern has smelt sweet tiny victory in his soul n body, he likes that feeling, that Bern is warm and he is intoxicating and he wants to win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox News is so scared shitless of Bernie Sanders that they know their viewers would support him if only they gave him the airtime he deserves.. but they already know he would out shine and reveal all of Fox Newss lies and distortions to their uneducated, middle american older viewers <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If anyone is low energy, its Carson. I dont think he will accomplish much. Also, Im not religious. Trump 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Gimme a break. If that is Bernie turns negative..., then I guess Jeb offered an endorsement after complaining about negativity when he said ...then elect Trump! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant wait until Bernie is the candidate to see what kind of bullshit Fox is going to say about him. I just hope Im not swept away into one of Obamas Black Liberation Theology reeducation camps by then. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Will likely be voting for Bernie Sanders. Why cant we be more like Canada. At least legalize weed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dr. Ben Carson is a real Black Man. Obama is not. Ben Carson came from meger background. Obama did not. Ben Carson will not have to hide his background like Obama did. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont want to get into the mud pit its not my nature then he insults Donald Trump on his faith? lol Ben carson really? what a lying piece of shit! anyone who would vote for Ben Carson over Donald Trump isnt a real republican. Just the same old establishment candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes the only Republican who isnt super extreme. Thats why he doesnt get headlines. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders will win Iowa and New Hampshire. But Hillary will win every other state primary and cruise to the Democratic nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
if Bernie doesnt get the democratic nomination, I wouldnt mind voting for this guy. Simply because he doesnt feel like corporate scum like the others. I can see why republicans like him so much. Honest to the most bare bones <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Best for the GOP seems to be Trump regardless to his bashing. The other candidates dont seem to make more sense or be more desirable. For Democrats it seemed like it was Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden who is not running after all and Jim Webb. That Webb guy is militant and I wonder if he really is an exrepublican you know what I mean <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh, I enjoying this. The more Republicans hammer Hillary, the more popular she gets. I want the Benghazi committee to continue and I insist on that. Oh, this is great. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Look, we all know by now that most of Congress, both democrat and republican, are paid shills for billionaires. Fox News is owned by billionaires.

If president Obama had been president when war was declared in Iraq.

He was the only candidate in my eyes that might have turned things around. I guess were going to end up either with a blubbering idiot or some basic bitch liberal thatll go too far with socialism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
did they go far left, or did you go far right? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fox news is a joke. These rich people are afraid of Bernie. because they know if he becomes president hes going to tax the shit of them. and thats something they dont want. Hey guess what fox news people. We the middle class also need help. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Question For all of you little socialistscommunists, If Denmark, Sweeden and Norways living standards are so good and so high, Why do the people need their grubbernment subsidies, FREEEEE EDUCATION, FREEEEEE HEALTH CARE, FREEEEEE VACATIONS, FREEEEEEEEEEEEEE? High taxes plus oil money from grubbernment off shore oil drilling that pays for all this. Seems like a reduced grubbernmemt and keeping more of your own money, gives you a higher standard of living at a lower cost. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Many people people believe that Bernie Sanders is a communist, that is why he may never be president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The republicans have never gotten over Watergate.

First of all, Im not a democrat, but this is how I see it. I think that Biden could have still possibly won the nomination, even if he got in this late. He would have had around 16% right out the door, and he likely would have convinced many more over time to jump ship from Hilary and Bernie to him. It would have turned into a very close 3way race, and since he is different then the other candidates, hed have had a pretty equal chance of winning. Glad hes not running though. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I am a huge George W. Bush fan but the fact is we were hit under his administration. Do I blame him completely? Of course not! However, Mr. Trump is not saying anything untrue and Jeb actually is.

Bernie Sanders IS a communist maniac. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is a socialist because he supports social security and hes right 911 was Bushs fault. Trump is a racist who hires Mexicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Let it just be clear the Conservative Party of Canada is pretty much like the American Republican Party, the Liberal Party of Canada is like the centrist Democrats, and the New Democratic Party of Canada is like Bernie Sanders Democrats, that means Canada isnt really leaning leftwing, the NPD being more to the left of the Liberal Party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im not sure how that will work when 60% of the GOP base have unfavorable views of him. Its even worse outside of the GOP. He may win the nomination, but the democrats could run a brick against him and still win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is what the nation wants!! No to amnesty, no to welfare, no to obamacare, deregulate the banks, build the border wall, and finally deport the mexicunts. Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Did you notice the part of the democratic debate where Bernie Sanders criticizes the MEDIA and how CNN has that piece cut right before he tells the audience to stop about the EMAILS. This shows that CNN news network truly work for the BILLIONAIRES that run CNN. How about we ask Hilary Clinton is getting her funding? Answer Time Warner Cable CNN Clinton News Network I wonder of FOX will DELETE this comment like CNN DELETES comments. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders breaks fundraising record,all from small donation,NO super PAC, NO corruption. Bernie fought for civil rights in 1960s,he marched with MLK. Bernie fought for gay rights in 1980s. Bernie against Wall Street deregulation in 1990s. Bernie voted against the war in Iraq in 2000s. #Bernie2016 #ProgressiveFTW <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

In short the democrats will support a president who lies and has no concern about American service personnel. Bernie Sanders is nothing but a left leaning communist. America is in trouble with guys like these <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is such dishonest journalism Bernie is not going to tax the middle or working classes at 90%. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The liberal movement now takes a stance that if you dont agree, you are either notenlightened, stupid, predjudical, a capitalist or racist and hateful. We need to fix the debt problem and Trump has the best strength to call it like it is and shame politicians into positive action. Trump is moderate and likes everyone, if they work hard. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Perhaps they Support BLM because they are not racists? Ever thought of that? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fox News is a disgrace. Bernie Sanders won the debate by a landslide based on every public pole. Start paying attention to the American public, Fox News. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Are you kidding me? That is complete BS! Hilary did not win the debates last night just because Sanders reused to talk about the email scandal! That is so f ridiculous. Sanders said that because he wants to talk about real issues and not something inconsequential like that email scandal which is an ongoing investigation so there is no point in talking about it until the investigation is complete. Everyone but FoxNews thought that Sanders won that debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This women is real and u Libtards can go suck Bernie off...Donald Trump 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BERNIE SANDERS FOR PRESIDENT!!! FUCK TRUMP!!! Hes just another BILLIONAIRE that has NO idea what the average American goes through. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its actually very surprising to see Fox do a fairly balanced piece on Bernie, where they at least allowed him to speak in regard to that bogus WSJ article, amongst other things. Its still obvious that he is a conservative republicans worst nightmare, they are all going insane listening to him talk about all these entitlements!! Haha. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a logic Bush, he kept people save after 3000 were dead, and then the thousands of dead American soldiers in irak,and lets not even mention the bush economy crap that gave the incompetent Obama an easy access to the White House. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont worry about Republican majority in Congress and Senate that are the least productive and least popular in history, Just keep worrying about those Emails.. By the way.. Trump says that Bush was responsible for 911..... No hearings on that? or how we got lied into war? or the anthrax that came from our own Government lab? No investigations of any of that? just emails,, really? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
G, then Bernie might win <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its so sad that FOX News and the media just refuse to say Bernie Sanders name, referring to him as other GOP candidates. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Whats impossible to understand is if anyone genuinely supports Fuckabee. Then there is Dr. Ben Carson... forget dogs already. That guy would make as Great a President as a flea on my cats butt! That.... or... as Great as Bernie Sanders. Then there is Hillary.... dont get me started. I give up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Even Fox News admits that Bernie needs to win. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
their 18 trillion number neglects to mention 15 trillion of that 18 trillion are already in the budget Bernies budget only increases spending by 3 trillion.whether we get republican or democrat that number will be 15 trillion over 10 years bare minimum nice going propagandists. #bernie2016 the people are with bernie sanders <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

IDK about you fox but I like the measure of polls, in which case Bernie wrecked hillary. There is even a poll on your own website that has Bernie winning 81 to 13. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie sanders 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is not just he President of the United States, Hes also a world leader. This is a smart man with a plan. Other leaders will shiver every time they have to meet Trump. They will have no idea what to expect, but it will always turn out good for both sides. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Corporate owned politician being praised by corporate owned news? nah. Bernie won the debate hands down. Everyone knows that....even when the media tries to tell you tat Hillary won. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow! an actual decent coverage! However, my theory is that theyve understood that the negative campaigning the media has been doing so far against Bernie was the wrong strategy and backfired. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Honestly, I dislike Hillary as well. But I kinda hope she doesnt get charged for this, because if she did, that means Bernie Sanders actually has a legit chance at getting the Democratic Nominee. If that cluck gets elected president, wed turn into a Greece on steroids. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump handles the media better than any candidate Ive ever seen. If he keeps performing like this, he will be our next President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

We should get rid of Bernie sanders first. First things first. Do not wait until America is berned. According to the polls in June, 47% of American voters answered they would vote for socialists. That is why Hillary Clinton overly show her progressiveness in dem debate to win dem candidate . <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
He says he is a counter puncher but he attacked Bernie for no reason. In reality he attacked because he sees how popular Bernie is getting and he is getting scared. Thats right you buffoon. You should be scared. Bernie would wipe the ground with you in any debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

the wicked witch of the west, killary clinton, is the democratic party candidate for the establishment. i do not support bernie sanders at all because i am a very conservative person not NEOconservative, but even i admit that bernie sanders won that debate and that is what the majority of the people who viewed that debate believe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
oh my god yes. this dem debate actually had substance thanks to Bernie where as the Rep debate hat rhetoric and pandering and name calling. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
crazy woman in the blue dress, Bernie did say how he would pay for free tuition. you just werent listening or you decided to go deaf when he said it. he wants a wall street speculation tax and that will basically cover it. the tax payers bailed out the banks now they get to provide education for the working people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary did very well in the debate. Maybe she did win, but that does NOT mean she was able to get her message across better than Bernie. She seemed very scared to talk about Wall Street and breaking up the banks. I think those small little slip ups will end up costing Hillary in the end. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahahaha...Bernie won the debate, and all the polls showed that. The mainstream media is being paid by the Clinton campaign to promote her. Thats what the money is for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie is a socialist scum. Thats why he loves communism and wants to abolish private ownership property. But he do love the banks, thats why he holds the debtmoney system in favour for the foreign banks VERY high. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is a senile communist who sounds like Woody Allen high on laughing gas when he talks. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its because of Bernie Sanders that the party and the agenda of not only the Democrats but the Republicans has shifted, not Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Oh for fucks sake this is absurd. BLM is not a campaign for black supremacy, but rather highlights the shocking disregard for AfricanAmerican life in America.

Do Bernie supporters or even the media realize that Nordic countries are social democracies and not democratic socialism? They are entirely different concepts and why Nordic countries are in not like the USSR. On the economic freedom measurements Denmark is more free, therefore more capitalistic than even the U.S. Sweden has privatized roads thats as free market as you get.

 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
so 59% democrat would, 49% of independents would and 26% republicans would. But 47% of americans? Republicans dont make up a majority of america. That 47% is skewed. That poll obviously asked more republicans to bring that number down. The media doesnt want Bernie Sanders to win because surprise surprise they are made up of the greedy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
People want something for nothing. The problem is there is cost somewhere and eventually everyone pays the price. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
NotQuiteLucid he evades every single question just by saying people loves him and it is going to make it huge.

Literally the oddest human to ever run for President. He did nothing in RI, during the recession, except give it the Holiday Tree. Stop licking and chewing your lips, and twitching. Get out of the race now, and give Bernie more time. Go Bernie! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hes comin for ur money and ur guns rich people!!!!! Hahaha haahahahah BERNIE BERNIE BERNIE!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It wasnt fear that lead to that statement by Bernie, it was respect. I think this will turn out to be a positive move for Sanders. People are sick of the politics, the backstabbing, but because thats what weve come to expect, the journalists see it as political suicide, when I believe that it will garner respect for Bernie and an eventual nomination. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All media polls show bernie winning.. And they dont talk anything about him.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Truth is guys and i hate to sound like a conspiracy theorists. But its between bush and clintons. The puppet masters will see to it....Unless a war is imminent and that means Obomba will stay in power. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This really sucks, fox news and the media are in the Clinton delusion when really Bernie won. Hillary is someone the rich celebrities can enjoy because Bernie makes too much sense for them. The millionaires have to much and the middle class has to little. Bernie didnt win for the media, he won for the people, and Im only 14 and a 73 year old is the most relatable too me than all the other democrats. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

His son is just as slimy as his dad. Im from the uk and I think and hope most normal Americans can see through this trump b s. But seeing how much the media, especially Fox News gives credibility to this baffoonery has me worried. Please America, do the right thing, not just for yourselves but the world, make Bernie Sanders your next president. Any other candidate is only going to hinder the evolution of human society. And none of us have time for that. USA USA!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THIS IS JUST FUCKING PROOF OF HOW THE NEWS IS PAID AND MASS MEDIA TRIES TO SWAY YOUR OPINION! THEY LITERALLY ARE SUBLIMINALLY AND VERBALLY CALLING HILARY A FUCKING QUEEN!

Bernie will destroy this country with his 90 % tax,amnesty,open borders,gun control,affirmative action,free college,free everything for illegals.The list goes on and on with this crazy nut. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This was funny, but for fucks sake Bernie is NOT a socialist. Time and time again he has specified that he is a democratic socialist and over and over has explained what he means by that term. and it is NOT against capitalism as the economic engine. He just thinks that the new income and wealthy generated by capitalism should not go virtually all to the top 1%, and that government should represent the middle class and not just represent wealthy campaign donors. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Bernie becomes the democrat candidate he will get crucified by the veterans groups that back Trump. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
HOLY SHIT!! This is so biased, if the american people cant see this, we are ALL in trouble! No one on the republican side will win. Do we really want a country ran by oligarchs? Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Clinton? Really folks?!?! Bernie Sanders 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why do trumph want a bigger millitairy, us spends more on military than eny other country in the world 610 billion dollars a year... china spends 60 billion, russia 50 billion. i wonder how USA would be if you would cut militairy funding by half and spend it all on hospitals and schools....... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the democrat voters are so ignorant, they didnt hear the scariest things that Sanders was saying they only heard the free shit that he would give them. Sanders will burn out... fuck the democrat party. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Joy Behar is an idiot, she is fucking embarrassing! this is why the country goes to shit, because they vote the way she does. they are aroused by socialism. You fucking ignorant clowns.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I can envision Donald Trump going down in history as the president who turned this country around. I truly believe that regardless of what anybody says. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I support Clinton and Sanders for 2016! Either one is better than any republican. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Enough of the Damn Emails! Lol! its so pathetic how you have not much to go after her so you stick to whatever you can to try demonize her some how! People dont buy your bullshit anymore. Watch Bernie win this election and them try to figure out why! It will be hilarious to watch! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Give it up Republicans, its Bernie Sanders you will run against and lose. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie won the be are tho <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders sounds better. Free everything. Just tax the rich at 90%. Its not like rich people cant afford to move, right? Its not like corporations are leaving america to go to countries that have lower taxes, right? Its not like the US has a big deficit, right? Wake up America.

my fav segment when bernie comes on. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
you idiots did you even watch the god damn thing Bernie clearly won <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All the candidates are being set up to take the fall for Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders SHOOK HER HAND after condemning her damn emails. Controlled opposition spotted. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bill OReilly is disgusting! Associating Bernie to Venezuela is ridiculous. Sanders has a real chance in this race and then we will see what Mr. OReilly has to say... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How is this legal? Hillary is a joke we all know shes gna do what people who pay her tell her to do. Bernie is the only real candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
except all the public polls say bernie won the debate by a wide margin! WTF are these people trying to sell us? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If you watched it Bernie clearly won then omalley then Hillary then web then chafee <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
um all the snap polls say Bernie won <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
he gives bernie shit for saying that nobody cares about the emails, then tells trump to stop talking about the emails and let the fbi handle it <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol the big theory is that Trump is only running to make the Republicans look bad on Clintons behalf, and here we also see him defending Hillary saying she was the best. Coincidence? I find it funny that after Bernies rise to fame, Hillary is now trying to change her tone and appeal to the same issues as he is. That is what you call a poser. It really just goes to show that Hillary is only running for Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To call these people idiots would be offensive to all idiots. At least we know theyre scared shitless of the prospect of Bernie winning, and they cant keep pretending to overlook him once hes the democratic nominee <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its Bernie and he will tear every republican opponent to shreds! Just wait <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OMFG Bernies Sanders not presidential?? These pundits ........ <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yea ok Hillary won... Just a ploy to draw some voters away from Bernie because Trump and the GOP party knows they are screwed. Feel the Bern baby! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this is the shittiest report on a presidential debate ever, these retards spat horse shit from their mouths and called it news. this entire report is just lies, Bernie kicked ass in the debate and we all know it. Feel the fucking Bern Fox News. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
They are all idiots! Bernie CLEARLY won the debates! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is such a pussy... he knows if he says all lives matter then the BLM movement will take over his microphone again. What a baby back bitch! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie talks about the black economy.. why do these people act like they dont <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie won, even by CNNs own poll. Kurtz, you are wrong, and reading from a prompter. Stop being a pawn for bigmedia, and be a REAL journalist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
According to the polls...Bernie was the winner. Hillary just pays more for airtime...smh. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We have 120 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities? Yeh, thats only if you believe nobody in this country will be working and paying taxes for the next 5060 years. FOX News youre such a joke! Cant wait to see yalls bemusement on election night next year when either Bernie or Hilary take the Presidency. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders hates rich people <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

...Carson is badass. Hes taking two weeks off for book tour. He does not want to comingle campaign money with his book money. Ben Carson is a rare one and really really what we need in these complicated times. I am suspicious of Barrack Obama, hes kinda sneaky and has fooled the American people, I am suspicious of Hillary, and Bernie wants free collegepoor house to the tax payers. Watch ratings go up while on vacay from campaign. Just watch. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie 2016. #feelthebern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Its not like the GOP have any novel solutions, either. Carsons tax plan would hit a 3T in just one year, because 10% is not enough to raise all the money needed to run the government. Trumps plan would raise the deficit 1.2T per year, too. Bushs plan would raise the deficit 3.4T. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant believe this is a real news channel. Theres not even any need for bill o reilly to be there his whole script is on the right the whole way <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BS!!! WTF IS THIS PROPAGANDA BERNIE!! FUCKING HANDS DOWN!! ?!??!?! WTF IS THIS GUY ON ABOUT!!!??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Guys you need to watch the damn debates yourself. SERIOUSLY. Being a lazy voter wont get shit done because people will come on TV and lue to your face about an obvious landslide victory by Bernie Fucking Sanders. Check the comment section. ANY FUCKING BODY who watched the debate knkws Fox is lying through its fucking teeth. These people make me sick. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
OReilly is banking on the fact that people didnt actually watch the debate. Because ONLY people who didnt watch the debate would think Hillary won. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Kurtz I think youre wrong. Bernie Sanders won most of the polls, and foxs exit poll. You would think that fox would have learned something from the 2012 election. Stop pushing the establishment message you cowards <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The democrats need someone who can answer guys like hannity ..... Bernie Sanders is one man who can do that <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont see how people say Bernie won, he did good. but was unprepared. The only thing he really separated himself from Clinton on was 420. I dont understand her positon on it. You can say a woman has the right to choose what to do with her own body. But smoking a lil smoke, NO. Its silly. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes FOX News, lets ask someone to comment on the democratic debate Bernie, I dont KNOW anything about him but he LOOKS the least charismatic. Great stuff <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What, is this american media? omg, this is pure propaganda s <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
jim webb may be the only decent democrat alive today. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
sorry to say Bill, but Hilary was laughable at best in her points for the direction the next President should take. Bernie pinned her down with verbal argument and won that debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
oh and btw BERNIE SANDERS 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well, I guess Fox wants Hillary to win the nominee, since most polls out there state that Bernie won by far, even the Fox News site says it. luntzfocusgroupsaysberniesanderswasbigwinnerdemocraticdebate <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Eric is a great speaker and businessman, especially for someone so young, this guy handles multimillion dollar deals everyday, and im sure he will go even further than his dad in business and maybe politics in a few years.

WOW, absolutely NO mention of Bernie Sanders, Corporate media and Washington pundits are absolutely DISGUSTING. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i love how wrong they are I live in Vegas Bernie won that debate <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The fact that Trump is so close to being the President of the Republicans, and the fact that Bernie is so fucking cool, is reason enough to vote Democrat. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You all know Fox news is garbage journalism who report you with republican favored bullshit right? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie sanders won <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ah cmon lads, Bernie clearly won this debate. For the life of me, I cant understand that people actually believe the crap that comes out of Reilly or Trumps mouth. When I listen to these two guys i feel its another reality TV show like keeping up with the kardasians. Feeling the Bern and I live on the other side of the world in Ireland. A country by the way which would no way believe an ouce of bullshit from these guys mouths. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie HAS never attacted Hillary directly because he doesnt have to. His history of voting understanding and fighting for the middle and working class speaks for him. Let alone the issues he has stood on his entire Career. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I love Bernie he won you can tell by Audience claps and cheers and all his policies are clear and make sense <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I think its racist to say black livesor any skin tone matters more then the others and if a white person said white lives matter of course that would sound insanly racist but to define and put into seperate groups lives by any skin tone black or white is racist in its self and you tellem david clarke...also that juan williams is a nut case damn liberals.Bernie so failed that test in the debate as well cause he was trying to be politically correct lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The least these FOX reports could do is have respect for all of the candidates. Really FOX News, how am I suppose to take this video seriously?!? Bernie was the winner, everyone one youtubeFBonline thinks so too. Do we really need another reason to discredit you? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hilary is a good piece of vomit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

what are you talking about? Bernie most def won that debate. Clinton wasnt terrible either Ill give her credit as well.. Fox youre a joke, and not fooling anyone anymore. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
lol hed leave you with 10% of your money. Thats not how taxes work you dumb biyatch. Stop lying to America. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie will never be president ,he couldnt even stop two black girls from taking over his campaign and telling his groupies to shut and listen or Bernie will never be allowed to speak on his own podium and Hillary will never president because she has no common sense or sensibility about the united states,its security or its citizens and what we think.....and she condones everything God does not while she claims to be a Christian.... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate liberals man <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Scant reporting on Bernie Sanders, an opportunity for fair and balanced journalism missed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Imagine is Hillary is found guilty. Not only would it destroy Hillary it would also destroy Bernie. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie sealed his fate when he helped Shillary regarding the emails. Not to mention, yes, us Americans ARE still concerned about this. Also the FBI is still in the middle of an investigation. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
because anyone who doesnt want more war is a weak pacifist <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If the winner can be decided by voting, Bernie was the landslide winner based on the majority of the online polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump does not deserve this much publicity. He is a big fat ignorant bafoon and so is Carson. No, there were no stars on stage because they all intelligently discussed policy and the countrys future. Bernie was correct. Were sick of those damn email attacks and want to hear something of substance to help this country. Can the Republicans give us an intelligent debate? I think not. All they do is pitch out fear and hate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Failed to mention major candidate contender Bernie Sanders. Not surprised. Clearly not objective journalism. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary did not win. All of the polls show that Bernie won the debate and all of the important arguments. Just like the media to shadow him and not play any of his segments. Fox news is garbage. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is the only candidate that wants to help the middle class, so naturally Fox News would try to make him seem weak and unimportant. A Game of Thrones quote that fits When you cut out a mans tongue, you are not proving him a liar, youre only telling the world that you might fear what he has to say Tyrion Lannister <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Props to Fox News to show Bernies response to the WSJ article <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The mainstream media is playing the dems just like they tried playing the republicans. All polls show that Bernie Sanders won that debate by a LANDSLIDE, yet they are reporting as if Clinton was favored, which she was not...This one was not even close.....They tried to pull the same BS with Trump..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All these Dem candidates look like they just stepped off the short bus ...... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is pure speculation, but before he even started speaking, just looking at his pics, I thought donalds son might be on drugs. As soon as he started talking, it certainly didnt help his case. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald Trump is a joke, Jeb Bush is a joke, Marco Rubio is a joke, Ted Cruz is a joke, Ben Carson is a joke, The Republicans are a joke, Fox News is a joke. But none of this is making me laugh anymore. The games over, Bernie Sanders is going to win, and we will get the money out of politics. Then media channels like Fox News will have to earn their money the old fashioned way by actually doing real reporting and not taking bribes from the rich. We will get our democracy back. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie obviously won, and he will win the primaries and the whole election. The people are speaking load on this one. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
God, its just so corrupt... Bernie clearly won the debate... Every poll agrees with me showing Bernie with more votes than any other two candidates combined... Journalism in the USA is at an all time low man... wake up America <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I cant wait until Bernie wins despite the obvious smear campaigning. Then this corrupt, antiquated, biased, yellow journalism can finally be put in its place. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox very rare network, how could they promote a real journalism if they are acting blind? check out the rude tone of Tammy Bruce 730 so lost in the historical matter. Mixing communist with socialism and centralism. Shame on her, strongly recommend her to grab a book and read about Olof Palme, Willy Brand and Clement Atlee. I bet she can not even locate Cuba or Venezuela in the map. Bernie for President. Feel The bern. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie President <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox thinks that by pushing positive coverage of Bernie, hell be the nominee, and would be easier to defeat by a republican. They dont understand that Bernie is far more likable and popular than Hillary, and he only needed to be presented to the American public.Once again, repubes and cons underestimate the underdog. Go Bernie! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Had to double check this was a Fox News video. Well done, mostly fair and balanced, I got to give respect were its due. But on the other hand this will be forgotten once Bernie gets the nomination and the attacks begin in earnest. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Governor OMalley keeping it classy. Trump isnt familiar with morality, kindness and virtue. America is tired of the vileness, xenophobia, scare tactics, and reality show antics of the GOP. Time for good will and graciousness. #BernieOMalley <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
theyre scared shitless of Bernie. they only played his Hillary email quote to make it look like hes pandering to her. Truth is, Hillary got berned in that debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This video should have been them congratulating Bernie on his obvious victory in that debate. Not surprised to see how many dislikes this video has. Everyones tired of the bullshit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders 2016!!! D <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the more they push against Bernie the more republicans join Bernies side, so hopefully all these republicans keep it up lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie trying to help Hitlery bury her emails breaching National Security? WTF Throw him in jail with her! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie makes sense but goes too far. Hillary knows how to find common ground and also stands her ground. This is America NOT Denmark Bernie! Hillarys America 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
this gives me some hope that fox might be a reliable network agian. when they want to be atleast. Bernie Sanders 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders clearly won the debate!!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im pretty sure trump dominated that debate and was not even there <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox News is terrified Bernie Sanders might become president because at least with Hilary Clinton nothing much of the massively corrupt political system will change, while Bernie Sanders actually seems to want to do something about the money in politics that funds Fox News and the mainstream media. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
How come the republicans got unfair questions but the democrats got fair ones?... How come Hilary Clinton is still front runner with all the scandals?....Just wondering. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
its easy.. cut military spending.. boom done.. also tax the rich.. boom done..next question? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I donno but i kindda feel Lincoln Chafee seems like a good guy!!! im a bernie supporter!!! but this guy looks really like someone who you can talk to and probably feel welcomed as well!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
THOUGHT BERNIE DID GREAT LAST NIGHT THOUGHT THE WHOLE PARTY DID THEM SELVES PROUD WISH THEY WOULD HAVE STUCK IT TO THE REPUGS MORE OTHERWISE GREAT DEBATE THE WEAK WILL DIE OFF AND WE WILL BE LEFT WITH JUST THE TWO. BERNIE 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
NO NO JUST HEARD ON FAUX NEWS THIS MORNING RIGHT FROM BILL ORIELLY OWN MOUTH THAT BERNIE SANDERS WILL NOT WIN SO YOU KNOW IF BILL SAYS SOMETHING ITS GOT TO BE THE TRUTH <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie won! they know the truth more than us. but they are just doing job of reading saying what is being asked to say. If the refuse, they will be replaced by another puppet. They are the super modelsactors hired by lobbyists to run their propoganda! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ok lets vote HILLARY WON! Or <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The last guy hasnt spent much time learning about Bernie, or he would not be able to say its hard to imagine Bernie as President of the United States. Sit back and watch sir. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
krauthammer is smarter than that. he is willfully spreading misinformation about Bernie sanders retreating on the issue of small business and capitalism. Bernie wants to protect small business and does not believe in a rigged, casino style corrupt capitalistic system. When Bernie talks about going after large businesses he is talking about billion dollar corporations that cheat the system by not paying taxes at all. Its time they start paying their fair share. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Ted Cruz.... He is the only republican candidate who has argued cases in front of the Supreme Court and who has truly led the fight within Congress.. Hes been trustworthy from the beginning And if you listen to him debate he is brilliant and well tempered...he would dismantle Hillary or Bernie perfectly...Cruz 2016, guys <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Tax on Wall Street speculation. Fair taxes of all people and businesses. Get corporate money out of elections. The rich man has had a good time for years now it is our turn so step aside. #BernieSandersforPresident <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie the Jew was the dumbest. The way he came to Hillarys rescue OMFG! Political suicide! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie basically came to Clintons rescue. What a moronic move.Political suicide at its finest. You never defend or protect your opponent ever. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders Won, the Republican are scared and dont want to admit it. read or watch any other video about the debate, or watch it yourself. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie makes the most sense <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Totally agree with those noting that the right wingnuts greatest fear is a Bernie candidacy. Now we need to encourage our friends who have been apathetic about politics to get out vote. I think that a record turnout would ensure a Sander victory. BTW downstream races are just as important! If Bernie has to deal wthis Congress, it will be difficultimpossible to make the changes this country needs <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
also bernie has 2 accounts which gained 50k total <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders is a punkass idiot. He literally came to Hillarys rescue by telling the moderators to stop talking about her emails. Look at her nodding gleefully.She couldnt believe her luck! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
wow fox news, look at the dislikes. Bernie clearly won the debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
do you think when Bernie Sanders lifts he screams out FEEL THE BERN! ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BERNIE 2016!!! my entire community is voting for him and I am speaking to several others educating them on my free time. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hahaha Bernie Sanders is against defense no...I think hes against offensive tactics. How many Americans died at the hands of Sadam Hussain prior to the war in Iraq...now how and still counting? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Am I the only one who noticed the microphones on CNNs debate? They were all the same height and not adjustable. Bernie Sanders had to lean over or yell to be at proper volume due to his height. Hillary Clinton came across the loudest, not the smartest. #Fixed #Game <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

BERNIE DESTROYED..GAME OVER <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders crushed the debate. Most polls agree he won by a landslide. Prepare to lose GOP. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Really??!! They actually talk about real issues not the JOKE what was the Republican debate. Its a shame that the Republican party was no longer an intelligent party, now they have become full of crap , they have been hijack by a christian cult. Bernie won the debate, hope Elisabeth Warren becomes his VP, so they can regulate the got them Banks and Wall Street, this fuckers were the cause of the HUGE Economic Crash, its a FACK <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
All Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders did last night was talk about free stuff.What about the fact that the country is more than 18 trillion in debt. Nothing is going to be free for people that work for a living. How are they going to support and defend the constitution?Everyone should have to pay their fair share of taxes. Hillary said last night that EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. Lets make everyone accountable for their recklessness and stop blaming it on material things <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is going to be her running mate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont live in US, but I often hear my friends from US talking about FOX as crazy TV network, and after seeing this, I totally agree. Conservative, right wing, fascist TV. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The internet is not your friend, Fox. May as well shut your YouTube channel down. Its pathetic how obvious your BS is, and also depressing how our voices matter exactly 0% to you. In any event, Bernie was the clear winner. Look at ANY internet poll and Bernie is leading Hillary by about 60 or 70 points! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie won! Hands down. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Billionaire owned Fox News is scared to death Bernie will win because he IS going to tax the crap out of the owners of Fox. Its very funny that Brit Hume ignored Bernie. He set the tone of the debate and obviously won it. Look Fox, we are smarter than you think, or stupidly hope. President Bernie Sanders. Sounds good, doesnt it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Fox News started being nicer now that they see Bernie has a chance to win. You dont wanna fuck up and smear the next president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie won hands down! Fox is delusional do we believe you or our hearing ears! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Arent the Democrats embarrassed with most of the idiots they have? The only one that might cause a problem for GOP would be OMalley. Hillary for prison 2016. Sanders seems honest but still a Socialist idiot. He will be in a nursing home before he could do 4 years. No Democrat will be President period regardless of the cost. We had enough of their stupidity. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Wow... I am shocked at how good of a report this was about Bernie! Bret Baier you did a excellent job with this! This is absolutly the most unbiased thing Ive seen Fox News do in years.

Useless interview... TRUMP WILL FUMIGATE THE HOUSE <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie didnt redefine Socialism, Scandinavia did. Thanks to the Internet, everyone in the world now knows that Socialist countries like Denmark, Sweden and Norway are always rated among the happiest countries to live in, have universal healthcare, education and paid vacation. Bernie is simply the messenger of this newly evolved DemocraticSocialism in Western Europe. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Burying your head in the sand about Bernie only exposes your fear, Faux News... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Everything Sean is asking him about Low work participation, low median income, welfare recipients are the problems Bernie Sanders talks about. The only thing Hannity wanted to hear was Thanks Obama.

Just more proof democrats only have an interest in interest groups, not the American people. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
bernie didnt help hillary by making the email comment. he helped himself. i cant wait until he gets elected. you folks at fox are going to look even more shocked than you did when obama beat the shit out of romney. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Even after the debate they still dont acknowledge Bernie <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
why isnt FOX News talking about the main issues that the debate was on ? This is the GOPS main issue. And by ther way look at just about every poll after the debate Bernie Sanders win the debate hands down. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yeah I didnt know about that Soviet Union honey moon or Sandies affiliation to Sandinista groups. Why Bernie?? Whyyyy??? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Listened just long enough to verify that these people are as out of touch as I thought. Bernie Sanders clearly won the debate look at the polls. Funny,with Trump being the Republican frontrunner,Fox remarking on the Democrats being in trouble. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

you can actually see how delusional fox news is, saying that democrats have no chance. When their front runner is a racist. They laugh at Bernie Sanders for suggesting we should fix our education system and say it cant be done, but applaud Trump for wanting to build a dome around the US. Think about that for a second....republicans would rather use government money to build a wall instead of use it to better our education system. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Sometimes I did wish the US was Denmark. With the exception of immigration, Denmark is actually doing very well. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders IS NOT A SOCIALIST. He talks about a capitalism that serves the middle class and 90% of the country rather than the millionaires and billionaires who only represent the 15% of the country. How is that radical? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The corporate taxes need to be reduced. Nobody wants to run a business to just pay taxes. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The people supporting Bernie Sanders are hardworking Americans sick of footing the bill for bailing out Wall Street and having an unjust system that benefits the rich while exploiting the rest of us. My family and friends will not vote for Hillary or Biden. Bernie is our candidate because he is the only candidate without a Super PAC. #feelthebern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary lost by a landslide. CNNs live poll had Bernie Sanders winning with 75% of the vote. Bernie said twice he would pay for his programs with a Wallstreet speculation tax and by removing the income tax cap and closing tax loopholes for corporations. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
fair and balance most of the time, but at critical times sneaky and snaky! They are definitely getting more evil and devious to brainwash the public...they could have fooled me tonight!

They had almost literally ignored any serious questions and tried to get Hillary off the hook for her Treason. That Bernie Sanders is a nut job that hates everyone that makes over minimum wage, yet he boasts people to donate 30 to his campaign after he says how hes not taking any big money from super PACs.

Never heard this guy speak before.

Your choice is as clear as it is stark. Choose freedom and democracy and vote for Bernie, or die a wage slave to the corporations. They wont let another Bernie get this close again.

bernie didnt even go to this event in person he was safely in vegas reading from his teleprompter via satellite feed and he didnt take any questions like trump did cause he is scared of what someone in the audience may say since it was not a group of his die hard minion supporters...or he was afraid if he went in person a bunch of women would shove him off stage again.What trump has is balls for doing this.trump 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Benghazi is the Republicans plan to defeat Hillary without having any new ideas...

Republicans have wasted their opportunity to lead. They got nothing done at all while in control of the senate and congress. This is why they will be thrown out of office in 2016. Repubs have ONE idea,,, cut taxes for the rich and increase military and police spending. When trickle down economic, perpetual war, and mass imprisonment failed they were out of ideas. Nothing is left but a hollow shell. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Democrats evolve, change, and learn. That is their strength. Conservatives are incapable of evolving, changing, or learning anything,, they are a party stuck in the past with no new Ideas... The republican Senate and Congress have done nothing, and have no new ideas. They used to be the party of one single idea.... Cut taxes for the rich But Trickle down economics failed... Now they have nothing left but hatred for others. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

This is a typical example of press bias. Carson wasnt being critical of the shooting victims he was answering a question regarding what he would have done personally. I am a big chicken and I dont support Carson in fact I support Bernie Sanders, but I do believe that it might have been better to have rushed the killer than to just allow him to shoot me. I probably wouldnt have had the nerve myself, but would have hoped otherwise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a joke! Bernie 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Clinton isnt as much of a vile intolerant liar like the Republican candidates but she does work 100% for big business just like the Republicans do so nothing in America would really improve with her as president, and thats why America needs Bernie Sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

It seems like just the other day you said the media doesnt ask bernie about his policy positions the most popular of any candidate.

Bernie sounds like a Democrat problem for now. Thats the only party where childish minds still exist. Fortunately there are enough adult minded Democrats that wont vote for him but need someone else to vote for that isnt corrupt and a liar like Hillary.

Free College ? thats an Investment for the U.S. to compete in a world economy.

Wow, Megyn Kelly has a surprisingly authoritativesounding voice. Bernie Sanders surprised me the same way the first time I heard him. But to sensible folk, content is king. Thats why Im voting for Carson.

for fuck sake we need someone that will get us closer and friendlier to Russia and china and iran and not in more conflicts with them and the War keeps going , dont you see that?

No matter what, the corporate media claims to have a story on Bernie Sanders, then they mention him for a few seconds then launch into Hillary Biden for the entire segment.

This is for all the marbles people. You have one choice....whether you like it or not. or believe it or not is totally irrelevant.

You dont know what the smasing record for induvidal campaning donars and the biggest crowds in the entier elections means? Well the let me tell you, it means that Bernie Sanders will be the 45 president of america. Even a 20 year old kid from sweden can see this. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
And hes still 18 points behind Hillary and has been for a few weeks now. Thats also only if you assume that Biden is running which appears less likely every week. Sanders really has little chance of winning at this point. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Americans never learn their lesson Put Bernie in office, and the nation will still be run by the 1%. If voting changed anything, theyd kill citizens in the streets. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Evidently neither Trump nor anybody here has read any of Carsons books. He has ALWAYS been very faithdriven and an avid Christian. And what he said was absolutely true. I dont think I can picture Trump also saying that his success is not of his own doing. Im still in favor of a TrumpCarson ticket in 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald Trump is the best representative of what America is and he is projecting the views of the people better than any of them.

I agree with Carson. This is a Christian majority nation, so we need a president to reflect the fundamental values of the majority. Do you think a Muslim nation would want a Christian president to represent and guide them? Its interesting how the media so quickly defends against religious discrimination but if Carson was asked the same question about Satanism I dont think we would be behaving this debate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The polling was from those 50 with landline phones. They totally disregarded the rest of the electorate 18 to 49.

The recent poll where Hillary is gaining only surveyed people 50 and over about the candidates. Hence, the illusion that Hillary is gaining, since she leads only in voters over 50. Bernie is either tied or winning with voters 45 and under. So, sorry Hillary, and sorry CNN, Bernies still gaining. Lesson always look at the fine print in polls. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

What does it matter? Carson will never be president, so whatever he says or does is meaningless. Ditto for the rest of the TEAliban GOP who are running. Even Republicans are jumping ships over to Bernie Sanders. Look for Republicans for Bernie on Facebook <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Get Joe Biden the fuck out of the polls! He isnt running and just being used to distract people from Bernie Sanders because then they have two names people know and vote for. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
As this is coming from fox, its automatically disqualified. If Clinton truly is leading, its because those supporters clearly do not fact check or thick critically. At 5%, detractors might even add another 5% so this is essentially meaningless propaganda. Bottom line is you are either for establishment politics or your not. I just cant see the appeal of any other candidate.... Go Bernie! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well duh. Everyone has been saying they didnt want to vote for Sanders. Just because his supporters are more vocal doesnt mean they have the numbers to win. Weekend at Bernies, dead man walking. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I have a feeling that this casino guy can be a GOP candidate. Then , lose to Bernie Chavez or Hillary most people are saying Hillary is finished Fox and media killed her by strange email scandals, then Bernie will be democrat candidate heww Obvious development trump to lose to Bernie by 10 % margin. Then America will be finished by Bernie socialist kingdom . Bernie sanders dismantle the U.S military and have a tie with every kingdoms and socialist regimes in the world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
In 2016, The worst choice would be Bernie being elected Second worst choice Donald trump Third worst choice Hillary Clinton The fourth worst choice Ben Carlson The fifth worst choice florina The sixth worst choice joe Biden . Hmmm, How frustrating for americans.. Trump is most possible one out of all odds. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You know what I like about Trump that no other candidate is able to do? He has that historical President quality that we havent had since Reagan.

I like how they dont mention bernie sanders. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
At the end, when Hannity asked if Trump would take a Salary, Trump said he wouldnt. See. This is why we need Trump. All other candidates are Career Politicians.

this guy only cares for a Republican in the white house. this guy makes probably 20 million a year and doesnt want to see his low tax rate rise to 43%. he pays a lower tax rate on income than a normal person making 55k a year. Bernie sanders wants to change that and he doesnt like it so lets bash the Democrats. fuck outta here. Bernie sanders for 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Gotta ask you Americans a serious question Does Hannity have some form of brain damage ? or is he just what Fox calls a journalist ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Could one sane person actually see Dr. Carson as a presidential nominee? I think hes not well spoken, and i could not see him negotiating a Iran redeal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Why do conservatives enjoy these smug clowns? Im Canadian but I really hope Bernie Sanders becomes President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am not optimistic that american voters would not elect demagogues like Bernie or Trump. The ultra far left Bernie Chavez And the ultra right trump are both definition of demagogues <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If American democracy fails by electing Bernie Chavez or Trump as president in coming election they will not only destroy themselves but destroy the rest of the world like the examples of syrian ,Iraqi situations before they fail America . American voters must clearly know and concern on philosophy and plans of candidates in their national security and foreign policies through acknowledging Obamas failure in the Middle East <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
..and how about also giving ALL candidates fair airtime.. ie, bernie sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Only 63% of Americans know that Hillary is an untrustworthy liar... I wouldve thought that number would be much higher! LOL FEEL THE BERN MOTHERFUCKERS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I like you bill but your wrong on obama being far left... Bernie sanders makes obama look like a center right politician. Honestly Americans are stupid voting against their very roots and beginnings as a country if they vote for a socialist. Fox news should spend less time criticizing hillary and more time criticizing bernie. I want a republican Pres. in 2016, period. I dont care who it is. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why is Bernie afraid of ??? He seems to always run away from confrontation. He ran away from Blacklivesmatter two girls who took his mic away. Now he is running away from OReilly. What gives Bernie? Im beginning to think you are not our man. No way am I going to vote for Hillary the phony, so who can we vote from but a GOP? Someone please help us! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

If you wanna cut millions of senior citizens social security by another 20%, kick 30 million off of healthcare, more war, greed and tax cuts for the mega rich.

This Uncle Tom, will never achieve the Republican party presidential nomination. To many racist within the power structure of the party who will allow it to happen. The race is really between, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz.

Most importantly he has a vision for the country and he has real policy. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I would say if the Dems are smart they need to get somebody else in the race .... Clinton is going to prison .... and Bernie doesnt know anything about economics ..... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I respect that Fox is showing Trump in a fair objective light, I know theyd personally like to see a candidate besides Trump be the republican nominee.

Dick Cheney is responsible for the death of thousands of american soldiers and trillions in debt... but Fox brings him on as an analyst and a consultant...

Fox NEEDS hillary. Thats why they talk about her 90% of the time their lips are flapping. Hillary running as democratic candidate is the ONLY way a republican stands a chance at ever sitting in the white house. They certainly cant do it on their own credibility and intelligence so the only way to succeed is to pray for an even more corrupt, even weaker candidate that makes them look better by comparison. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Personally Joe Biden is 72 now, if he wins, he will be 74 before he gets in the white house. which will make 79 by the time swearing a new president comes along. Average age of death is 76, so the odds are we will lose the president half way threw is 1st term. And this is the best the Democrats have to offer? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Illegals need to go because theyre illegal... Thats not racist. Why is Trump so popular? Because of what hes saying. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

James from the Boston Globe nailed it there. It will be Trump vs. Bernie. The Crazy Uncle Joe as the Democratic establishments safety school was a dead on analogy.

Hillary is saying in her speeches that everybody should have the opportunity to succeed. Republicans say that too. My question is what about the guys with low IQs or disabilities that keep them from doing jobs that pay a lot of money. Are they supposed to live in poverty? Isnt everybody entitled to have a good life if they are willing to work, whatever that work may be? Bernie Sanders thinks so. Listen to a few of his speeches. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Oreiley Mr. Sanders is a socialist, a radical guy. Yes, because improving the healthcare system, giving free college education, ending for profit prisons, and getting bribery out of politics is so radical. The majority of the nation, including republicans agree on these policies.

Jeb Bush has NO passion. We dont need another Bush, its the last thing we can have, as well as another Clinton. Its time to stand and LEAD again! To be respected again! Donald Trump is a true leader, he has the passion and the ideas to lead the country to where it should be.

Why does anybody think Giuliani has any credibility on legal issues after his boy Bernie Kerik spent 3 years in federal prison for multiple counts of corruption?

This may be the first election where the candidates arent bought and paid for. Say what you want about Donald Trump, he doesnt need anyones money to tell him what to say. And Bernie Sanders certainly isnt paid for by big corporations on account that they despise him. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

You are an idiot. You try to create some boogey man. The fact of the matter is that all of Bernie Sanders policies are supported by the majority of Americans.

How do they explain the record turn outs in Texas and Arizona by Bernie? Last I checked those were red states. Every poll I see has Bernie as the favorite to win the presidency just based on the facts that more than 65% of Americans agree with him on the issues and more people are turning up to hear him speak than anyone else running. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So wait... are they cowards... or bullies. Literally accusing them of being both in the same sentence. Are they bullying you or are they scared of you? If youre going to make things up at least have some continuity. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

One of the main reasons I respect Bernie Sander is because he will make a point and stick to it and defends his point. I also respect Trump for this reason. However, many of Trumps positions are absolutely asinine. Deporting American citizens? Ya, good one. However, it contrasts well with many of the Republican candidates who seem to change their opinion every time the wind blows. Look at Palin, though not a candidate, she dodges and side steps everything sent her way! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump We should make murder legal! Everyone reacts Reporter Care to elaborate? Why should we make it legal. Donald Trump If it werent for me you wouldnt even be talking about murder.

Normally I am against the majority of what fox says but they pretty much hit the nail on the head with this one. Bernie Sanders is the honest, fair, hardworking candidate who engages his supporters and the public and is in touch with the voters. Then theres Hillary who takes photos with vapid celebrities and has never said an unscripted thing during her campaign. The only thing fox got wrong was calling Bernie a socialist, hes not socialist hes a constatutalist and a humanist. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

trump is a c.i.a. war, and business party shill, trump is willing to put 1 billion dollars into this obviously doomed to fail campaign, just to attempt to get as many idiots possible to waste their vote on him, that way, it will be the same as not voting, not just because he wont win, its a strategic waste, to that there is more despotic control, slanders or the green party are the way to go only, otherwise your a fake american, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

I think its safe to say that Bernie will win the white house. In fact, I dont think a Republican will ever get into office again. America doesnt have the same values anymore. Everybody wants something for nothing, including conservatives. As much as liberals wont admit it, Trump has many democratic ideas. Personally, I think Trump and Sanders both have the right idea on Health care. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Israel gives their people free healthcare, are they too liberal? Also, I dont know where FOX gets its data, I know they make a lot of it up, but Bernie has a LOT of mainstream appeal. Believe it or not, investing in education, health care and infrastructure is not extreme. The TERRORISM of the FOX news misinformation machine would have you believe otherwise. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fox and the rest of the right have based their strategy on the apparently mistaken assumption that Billary would be the opponent and they just cant let it go. The only one over there that recognizes that Hillary is not losing because of what is wrong with her is George Will. Sure Billary and the entire field, Republican and Democrat, are losers, but they are losing because of what is right about Bernie Sanders not what is clearly wrong with every one of them. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I guess Fox has to try and polish this turd of a field who cant beat Bernie. You rich guys were dumb enough to give these idiots money and you deserve to lose that money. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

DONALD TRUMP a HAND JOB For the RICH BERNIE SANDERs a HAND UP to We the PEOPLE who BUILD this NATION with our bear Hands ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders wont get the votes because 1. He knows nothing about economics 2. He doesnt have the interest of corporations who sway the votes 3. Liberals are retarded. 4 Black Live Matter will lower his black votes by being jackasses. 5. Hell die of old age before the election. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why do people still talk about Sanders? He is irrelevant. There are not even close enough stupid, ignorant and selfdestructive people to vote him into WH, despite the media propaganda. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders has a detailed plan. Why not talk about that? How do you feel about that plan Sen. Rubio? #FeelTheBern www.voteforbernie.org <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Panic button lol the Republicans should be sitting their pants over Sanders because he would destroy any of them in a general election Im sorry u dumb ass white people calling him a socialist doesnt cut it also if anyone can revive Change Bernie Sanders will be the one to do it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders supports instant citizenship for all 11 million undocumented illegal aliens that currently live in this country. SOME of those people have violent felony convictions......HOW ON EARTH can you support that?! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary CORRUPT Bernie HONEST Democrats have to pick one... Im going with Bernie Sanders! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The definition of insanity is voting for career politicians over and over again and expecting a different result. Career politicians are definitely not the answer! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Yes, Hillary has lied and she will continue to lie because shes a fucking liar and thats what liars do! FEEL THE BERN MOTHERFUCKERS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders scares Fox News shitless.. If they interviewed him.. hed run circles around them and he would also run circles around ANY other republican candidate.. with his solid policies and productive solutions.. which is more than anyone else has put forward.. inc hillary <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
For all the Bernie Sanders fans you have to know if he is elected president he would not be able to get any of the things hes campaigning on done. I would be amazed if he found 5 congressmen who shared his beliefs. The republicans own both the House and Congress. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary Clinton never gets heckled by black lives matter..... but all of her opponents do????????? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This arrogant, lying, megalomaniacal, paranoid, socialist, carpetbagging NY Senate CUNT would sell her granddaughters liver to satisfy her political ambitions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The Clintons are corrupt, as are all Democrats!! Scandal scandal scandal! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My gosh this is ridiculous. How could this still be a story? There isnt a scandal. This is just Republicans creating a story that isnt there to discredit her in the general election because they know if its an election on policy instead of identity she will win. Do I want her to be the nominee? Of course not. I want Bernie Sanders and Warren as his running mate. Shes part of the establishment. Another Bush with a different name. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
open the door for biden? sanders 2016 is what this is going to help. notice how fox is afraid to even mention sanders name because they know the more people find out about him the more people will vote for him. seriously? open the door for biden. nobody is thinking about biden. the 2nd name that comes to mind for democrats in the election is bernie sanders, right after hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hey republican scum no matter how much you bitch about Hilary, she is still gonna be president. How does that feel? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
he would make a great vice president for the donald <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Anyone who has been to a Bernie Sanders speech in the last 30 years has heard his policies and known he was the definition of right side of history. He fought to end segregation in the 60s, fought for gay marriage in the 80s, and attempted to prevent the wallstreet crisis in the 90s. Go to one of his speaches, or read his voting record! #feelthebern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
it is about time we have a president with some brains and morals and who is not our of touch with people and may be able to make real changes in our government and put we the we back into we the people <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie Sanders 2016. Last chance America! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is popular because he is a wealthy celebrity who has promised us the moon. I would love to see Trump face Sanders in a oneonone. Bernie would expose the NEOCON demagoguery and knowledge deficit that underlies Trumps rhetoric. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

YES! Feel the Bern 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I dont understand people who say Bernie cant win so theyre going to vote for Hillary. He can win if you vote for him in the primary, if he doesnt win the primary THEN you vote for Hillary. Although personally, Id almost rather vote for Trump or even Jeb Bush than Hillary. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Feel the Bern Hillary!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
no other candidate comes anywhere close to bernie sanders.. and more and more americans are beginning to realize this regardless of the mainstream media trying so hard to ignore him <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Because of Trump, Hillary Clinton will be our next President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump 2016 hes our only hope. Democrats are confirmed communist. Bernie Sanders, is a socialist, and the dictionary says its that socialism and communism are the same. Trump 2016. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump should run as independents. Tho only way I would ever support Trump is if he and Bernie collaborate. Bernie for president, and Donald for VP Donald has the businesseconomy knowhow, and Bernie has everything else. Lol idk what Im saying.

Bernie Sanders is probably the least liberal candidate in the field, using the classical definition of liberal. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This whole debate was a joke, everything from the moderators to Jeb Bushs beady soulless robot eyes. Many of the issues that matter most to so many are simply not mentioned. Also, they seem to be so sure that Hillary will be winning the dem nominee... God forbid you mention Bernie. The only thing im worried about is when the Establishment figures out they cant beat him and do him like they did RFK. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
BERNIE SANDERS 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hillarys not worried about the Republicans right now, shes worried about Bernie Sanders! Thats why she had George Soros send in his BLM agent provocateurs to disrupt Bernies speeches in Arizona and Seattle. Whatever her new strategy is probably just copying Bernie it wont work. Theres nothing she can do to change the fact that nobody wants her to ever be the president. FEEL THE BERN MOTHERFUCKERS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Rand is right! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders tells people what his plan is and Hillary says, That is what I will do too... The only difference is that when she says it, shes lying!

It doesnt matter what she promises like Obama shell do what Goldman Sachs tells her to because shes their whore! FEEL THE BERN MOTHERFUCKERS! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
#Blacklivesmatter #GeorgeSorosBullshit George Soros donated a million dollars to Hillarys campaign so he wont be sending his agent provocateurs to her speeches...

Trump says that the problem is that the insurance companies have total control of the politicians. Hes right.

Only Bernie Sanders has the specific solutions, public financing of elections, and a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
To blindly support a flawed policy is as foolish as one can get. To suppor another evil invader who promises more wars and more status quo deserved to lose.

I laughed when Donald Trump said we need brain and pointed to his head. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Megyn Kelly just said that youre a democrat if you call your opponents clones and puppet ? She is so dumb ! Apparently, Trump often disagrees with the other candidates and he expresses it in the most childish way but that doesnt make him a democrat. Bernie disagrees with Hillary even though he doesnt call her names. Plus, what kind of democrat would say that mexicans are rapists ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Donald Trump is just like Bernie Sanders he is a populist who speaks to the crowds. That doesnt alone make a good candidate to me though. We have ZERO reason to trust him with his past donations to the Clintons and his past support of single payer. His complaining about the status quo with a complete lack of real substance reminds me of Ron Paul, except that Trump is twice as vague and half as principled. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
If Donald Trump is elected president I strongly encourage ALL liberals to move to Canada. Only then will we finally see that Conservatism works and Liberalism is the cancer in America. Even Canada will eventually get tired of you. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Vote Bernie Sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No it doesnt sound like the temperament we need. Hes classless and arrogant. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Are you a stripper, an escort, or just a hottie impressed by an arrogant, entitled governor of Texas? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I believe that all red blooded Americans should vote for Trump !! Get rid of politicians and bring in a business man !! Trump is clearly the only choice !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
These Repugnicans Have nothing for America but more Rederick and though talk on wars <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im going to reform Washington. We have a corrupt government and I am going to end all corruption.... blah blah blah blah blah blah. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump is so arrogant. He is like other republicans, but he wont even shut up. This man is not what we need as a leader. He is what we need as a person who shuts up. I will cry if he is elected, and then we will all slowly go insane. And with that I conclude Bernie Sanders, 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Our freedom isnt being taken away by the Government, but by the corporations and special interest groups controlling the government. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Donald says I was the only one on this stage to oppose the Iraq war because I thought it would destabilize the middle east, I was right. Bernie Sanders was the most powerful and vocal opposition to the war, and said in congress many times that he opposed it because it would destabilize the middle east, and because he didnt believe Bush, Rumsfeld, and Cheney. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
What a group of clowns! Arent Republican voters embarrassed by these people as representative of the best and the brightest of Conservative thought? I am looking forward, as the weeks pass, to seeing more and more Republican voters turning to Senator Bernie Sanders for President as they learn more about him and listen to his opinions on the important issues facing Americans. Bernie Sanders for President 2016!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The earlier debate was as good as the main attraction ... I liked what the majority said, but Graham, and Christie ... are two who did not express views that I agreed with. What do you think? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie Sanders on tonights debate The Republican debates are over. Not one word about income and wealth inequality, climate change, Citizens United or student debt. Thats why the Republicans are so out of touch with the American people. What I heard was more tax breaks for the rich, more people losing health insurance and more talk about war. This is not what we need. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Political correct has nothing to do with insults and making derogatory comments. I was starting to like him but after the debate, I am not going for him, he was not objetive in any of his responses, and some of them he change the subject. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

My God I thought Yanks were on the ball and had come to their senses after electing that clown Bush but I can see things have reverted back to following a muppet! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
It would be hilarious if he ends up being the republican nominee because hes the one whos taking all their spotlight. Still I think Bernie is more honest and I would rather see him become the next president. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

As an independent I find it almost impossible to vote for Republicans that are bible thumpers as I am agnostic and scientific. Their stance on social issues are retarded. Its 2015 not 1515. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
the two party system in America naturally divides everyone into an us them mentality. who cares if Trump is either.... he gets shit done and will kick ass. Faux News needs to fall back on the Donald. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Trump brings a refreshing nonpolitical aspect to the debate, and so did Carson. But Trump has a good record of success, hes well stocked, hes got plans and can put up a fight in Congress. I think he can protect my rights as well as his most precious assets, so yeah, Id vote him in. I dont think someone could reason me out of that quite yet anyway. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
She sounds like a breath of fresh air, I like Trump and Fiorina <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Horrible debate should have called it the Trump roast hour Thought Fox would have been fair but sadly like all big business media they were not. Trump was asked personal questions others were asked policy question. BTW at this point Americans deserve their fate for putting up with big business, media and lobby control... Sad Fox news included. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I hate republican politicians but Trump is spot on! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Rand Pauls hair looks like my ball sack . Bernie Sanders 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This is exactly what Bernie needs to win. Someone other than Trump wins the primary Trump goes independent. This divides the Republican party in half, and Bernie certainly wins the election if he wins the primary, which he has a real chance of doing. This is the scenario that needs to occur for America to really change, so I beg of you, Republicans, please vote for anyone other than Trump, unite for another candidate. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dont get caught in the bushes folks. He is a fucking bot. Play it safe with the trump card. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie has a very large following, people should wake up and pay attention. How about instead of polls, we look at how many people are showing up at their events.

Its so hard to listen to politicians. It makes my stomach turn. Democrats or republicans. They all are puppets, almost wax like and droning in the same tone, using thier hand movements taught to them by thier handlers. This country is in trouble if we keep voting in these people. We all need to have a vote protest. No one vote, until we get rid of these types of zombies <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really think the GOP doesnt want him and thinks they could corner him to back maybe Bush if they dont nominate him. Trump doesnt need the GOP, he could easily run as an independent. I truly believe he would take Dem votes and a lot of Republican votes too. They shouldnt have made it so obvious their dislike for Trump because now he looks even better than before!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hes the only one who could run as an independent, and hes the only one whos honest enough to say it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

The media isnt talking about disagreements in the party because there are few to none. Everyone that supports Bernie, from what I have seen, tends to agree to all his talking points and solutions. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Well of course he is...because, everything he does is a joke! Hes the joke on America!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Wow how much does Wall street banks and corporation paying you to put out this propaganda. Just how much does integrity cost these days? Bernie is a man of the people, for the people. Socialism means a government for the people and by the people. Intelligent people dont fear this word we understand it. Your pathetic fear mongering no longer works. Give it a rest. Fox New is #FeelingtheBern . Bernie Sanders 2016 ! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
This dirtbag is asking what type of people are attending are they women, are they men, are they young people all the while the background shows that the Bernie Sanders events are attracting all of the above. But I guess Fox Fiction is getting worried about his popularity, so they feel its time for them to start trying to undermine him. Fox is disgusting, a cancer that divides America and spouts a nonstop stream of right wing propaganda. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Actually, if you look at tat the cheering crowds at the Bernie Sanders speeches, they are obviously a wide mix of races, and ages. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Continuing the Fucks News tradition. As you can see, nobody likes you assholes, and I hope youre happy with alienating America! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is the man! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Fox News is not real news <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Two possibilities with the Trump candidacy. 1. He is the greatest troll of all time, doing all of this just for the lulz. Or 2. He is a trojan horse for the Democrats. If Trump gets squeezed out of the GOP and IF his supporters hold steady, he WILL launch a third party run which will split the vote and just like in 1992 with Perot, Hillary Clinton will win the White House in 2016. Either way Trump will destroy the Republican party. Personally, I say good riddance. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Prepare for meltdown FOX. I cant wait to see your empty heads explode when a Democratic Socialist becomes President. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Todays Biased Bash were going to try and make you think that the people who support Bernie Sanders arent real people.

Bernie Sanders is going to be our next president do you get that Fox News! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The news media is blocking Bernie Sanders out. I guess all these news media outlets work for the billionaires I mean think about it they talk about these super PACs all that money going to the different candidates from the billionaires no wonder it cost so much for those television ads the Koch brothers and billionaires are just going to get the super PAC money back because they own all the media outlets like Fox News <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why are those news ladies talking about Bernie Sanders <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Hey readers, crazy that this segment was about whether Bernie should be scrutinized, and in my opinion, he should be. But instead this segment just name called because IF Fox closely inspected and examined Bernies views, which is what to scrutinize is, then they would report something that the lower and middle class American would want to hear and they would have to use Bernies logic that he uses to defend his answers. Do you think FOX would want that? No. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Bernie will get the African American support once they know that hes been there with them on civil rights since the beginning. He marched with MLK!

All you Trump haters, FUCK YOU! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Subject to a lot of media analysis and scrutiny? And is media analysis and scrutiny supposed to mean the likes of inane fling metaphors i.e., Bernie Sanders is that fling you enjoy because you know they will be out of town soon? Or perhaps four scantily clad female, and one fully clad male, anchors scrutinizing an issue in a Socratic discussion on Fox? Please............ <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Thank you guys! I KNOW youre scared of Bernie, now... I know that you are aware that hes a threat! Thats all I could ask from you guys FEEL THE BERN! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

My main hope is the democrats dominate the legislative branch with the elections. Because lets face it, Bernie has all the right ideas, but if the Republicans dominate the floor, almost nothing he wants will get passed. Its a heart wrenching time. Not only hoping that he gets through the primaries, but that he wins the presidential election, and that he has the supported needed in the legislative branch to get his ideas running. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Vote Bernie Sanders 2016! Please donate to his campaign, and advocate for him! We need Bernie, and he needs us! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
You know back then people could really be skeptical about things like corporate controlled media and this whole notion and concept of corporate America. But now everything is coming into place. Their criticisms coming just before Bernie starts to pick up steam explains everything. Its all true! There really is corporate interests behind the television screen! The online presidential revolution has begun and theres no going back!!! Bernie 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Ok Kurtz, keep not talking about Bernie seriously if that spoils the fun. 237 If you guys change your mind make sure to keep the ad hominem to a minimum and talk about the differences between Bernies positions against the republican candidates positions. That really is your moral obligation as a journalist even if you dont get paid by FOX to do that. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Who will be the tool of the Koch brothers? Will it be Rubio or Walker? Bernie Sanders 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Media doesnt take him seriously because its King Bush the 3rd vs Queen Clinton the 2nd! Clinton is already president! Trump is entertainment and Sanders is to old! BushClinton decided for you! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So, Bernie is for entertainment? The thing to talk about is what he wrote four decades ago? Stand by guys, you will be entertained beyond your wildest dreams! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

HAHA, look whos starting to take Bernie seriously... it kills me that the only dirt they can dig up on Bernie is 40 years old. Good luck FOX trying to spin Bernie, he has facts on his side.. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Far Right FOX, doesnt state the facts clearly. They pick and choose what theyre saying to distort the truth to get people to hear what they want people to believe is the truth. Theyre fooling themselves if they think people havent caught on. They know Bernie Sanders is real, and honest, and a man who has lived his adult life taking action on his beliefs. He isnt offering us lip service like so many other politicians. Feel the BERN Fox NewsFeel the BERN! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Simple two words Bernie Sanders! !! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Im impressed these boot licking lackeys can talk with their masters hand up their ass. It sickens me that there are people foolish enough to buy into the garbage Faux news spews from their mouths. There should be a law against an organization pretending to be a news outlet. And for fucks sakes Kimberly Guilfoyle ease up on the make up, you look like a mime that doesnt know how to shut the fuck up. If you did shut up for a minute youd hear how Bernie plans on doing it. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
good thing Bernie is actually a DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST, not a socialist which are different things nice try though, Fox. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Because Bernie Sanders is in many ways objectively the best candidate, and Trump is a piece of shit. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Bernie is a stupid old socialist bastard. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Because Bernie is former president of a college with experience in politics... and Trump is a 4 time bankrupt businessman with experience in reality tv. Seems like a silly question. Hes basically a Kardashian. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
No fox dont play this ur Mad cause he has great ideas and the New generation loves him ur failed ideology will never win you an election again Trump pays people to go to his crowds LMAO cant wait for these Mad Bigots <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Whywould they not? Bernie is a Socialist Communist, and they are Socialist as well, thats what Unions are. Dont matter if they do fly the Stars and Stripe and say they have patriotic pride. At their very heart they are socialist... then again ... some are tied to the mob as well, guess that is why they like Democrats over Republicans. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

Good, More power for Bernie is more power to the people. You will never get another shot at a candidate who cares and has a track record devoted to defending the rights of the people.

Moron. You say he chose a church instead of a school because of schools. Because churches dont have guns, as if schools do. To many people in this country, that is no different than putting up a Nazi flag at the state capitol. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Why At 415 does he mess w wedding ring? Not trustworthy according to AMA pyschology profile cheater. Bernie sanders all the way! Someone we can trust. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary is as transparent as a brick wall. Bernie Sanders for president because he has a history that proves we can trust him. #feelthebern <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Hillary Clinton is a liar! Bernie Sanders 2016 <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I am an Atheist AND A REPUBLICAN! The Republican Party will not re gain power until the party is purged of religious fundamentalists. Religious fundamentalism and theocracy is NOT CONSERVATIVE... also not constitutional. True REPUBLICANS must fight RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM so we can move away from Leftist collectivism and move towards Liberty and Individuality. Jefferson , Madison and Franklin would have approved this ruling today. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Is Mitt Romney still relevant in the Republican Party? <#urls:1> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
So all you detractors would rather vote for that lying scumbag Hillary. Or the other Bush moron. What the hell is wrong with you people? All you can come up with is comments about his hair? Its no wonder this country is in such bad shape with an electorate that includes brain dead morons like you all. Trump is exactly what this country needs.

Bernie Sanders For President!!! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Nice to see at his age, he doesnt need bengay yet... good many, many more years of r man Bernie. I like Bernie, Steve Jordan, and the drummer from the Crusaders Stix Hooper the most. Like Neil Peart. However, he does not have that rhythm like the fellows mentioned, so he is not on my list of the greats. Rhythm needs to be at the core and flows out from a drummer. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
One crazed lib president giving a medal to another crazed lib president. Gross. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
We need a leader who is strong, buy not power hungry, not looking to start a war. Someone who is ready to open all decisions be made by the people, for the people, not against the people, and without the peoples voice. I dont see that in anyone here. They all want power. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
A foreign Leader has no business addressing our representatives. They represent us, not him. He has no business A foreign leader addressing our congress calling for us to go to war is a disgrace <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
My fellow liberals, dont think that she is the only choice for the nomination. Back in 2008 they said the same thing but look who got it then? Look into Martin OMalley and Bernie Sanders, its time for a new wave of liberals to gain popularity! REAL liberals. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not exactly the way I remember how to make the Egg Cream or as Bernie used to say EckCream because theres no egg. 2 squirts Ubet syrup, of course. Splash of milk. Stir and top off with seltzer. Now....heres the secret push the seltzer valve forward and you will get a jet stream which develops the frothy head. Yes....a pretzel....all for 12 cents. Oh....and its always served in a coneshaped paper cup. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Look.....once again Hillary has sent the needle on my Bullshit Detector deep into the red zone. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I guess it boils down to this Who do you trust, a bunch of dumb ass right wing tea baggers, who dont care about anything besides power and enriching themselves, or do you trust what could be the greatest Secretary of State in our history ? <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! Why are you supporting this warmongering maniac? Iran, Irak, Libya, Syria, none of these countries did anything wrong. Israel is just manipulating you idiot Americans into fighting their wars for them, destroying decent governments in the Middle East just because it benefits Israel. How do you not see what you are doing? Do you not understand the consequences that will come if you keep doing what the Zionists demand from you... <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Really good <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Netanyahu getting the honor and respect he deserves. Shame on the handful of Democrats who hid under their rocks and wouldnt be there. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Not a Huge obama fan but I will never support those fairytale living republicans. They just dont understand u cant cut taxes and increase spending. Please, bring clinton back <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
i just wonder who is Obama side on the United States or isis he cares more for them then the lives of americans and i think he is one of the biggest fools to ever be in the White House, <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The vast majority of ISILs victims have been Muslim. This should be the disclaimer on every post about ISIL. This isnt a war against Islam, and they do not fight for Islam. I have little respect for Obama, though that is in part due to the senate, but his stance on terror is by far one of the best in the western world. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
crazy world <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
The federal government really needs to address this issue, and grant permission for banks to do business with legal cannabis sellers within states where cannabis has been legalized. The video is spot on, carrying this much cash around often is a recipe for trouble. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I voted for President Obama I wish I could vote for him again in 2016! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I have no more campaigns to run conservatives clap I know because i won both of them Obama Wins Again lol <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Dear Republicans, Tea Party, conservatives and fundamentalists Prepare yourselves, you have a minimum of 10 more years of Democrat leadership. Once Hillary declares shell run for president, its all over for you. Barry is witty, uses humor wisely, and speaks so eloquently. This was one of the best state of the union addresses, ever! He sure scored big with his comment I have no more campaigns to run...I know because I won both of them. BOOM <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
our economy is growing a creating jobs since 1999. even though I am Republican I support President Obama and his policy. he is right undoubtedly. I ask all fellow Republicans to support Obama. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>

My brain lost IQ by listening to her speech. Extremely robotic as if she has never done a speech before. Makes you wonder what her state was thinking... wait... they werent. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
I really dont understand what she is trying to say. She rambles in the whole first part of her speech about bread bags and then talks about the keystone pipeline which has been shown to destroy jobs in the long term, not create them. What trade barriers is she talking about? Then she talks about loophole cutting but when it is brought up in the senate they strike it down. This is a speech about nothing, disappointed. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Biden should be President! <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
Great publication NYT. Good, keep it up. <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
On May 1st, the sporting world suffered a devastating shock, when 3time F1 world champion #ayrtonsenna was killed during the San Marino GP. It has prompted a major overhaul in the safety regulations, while months later, Bernie Ecclestone labeled it as the most miserable season he ever lived <#urls:0> <+emoji:0> <-emoji:0>
