z13hfv4qgzqoflrf422ovtarpuj1jr2pn04, 2015-11-21T21:07:35.173Z, Everyone says Cruz is a great debater, unfortunately what makes him "great"  is that he never answers questions. The interviewer can repeat the  sentiment or idea Ted JUST said he supported back to him in the form of a  question by saying, "Ted, do you support a religious test for refugees?"  Will he answer the direct question? Nope. Never. He'll dance around it,  attempt to change the subject, etc. People think he's honest and  forthright....but he's the EXACT opposite.﻿

z12aytaz2ne1hze1h222c5zzpv2oefy2t, 2015-10-30T06:40:08.951Z, Where's Ted Cruz's highlight on mainstream media bias ABC? That received  the loudest applause of the night and changed the entire direction of the  debate. In fact, I'd say the theme of the night was the Republicans banding  together over mainstream media bias and the direction CNBC's moderators  wanted to take this debate.﻿
z13fyn5y1ruafhnbe04cj5s4hzehwjogymg0k, 2015-10-30T00:17:05.064Z, Rubio is too young and it shows. Carson is a moron, and he lied on the  Mannatech question. Trump is too immature, and he lied on the Zuckerberg  quote... Hillary, even worse, responsible for the death of an American  ambassador. Jim Webb was a better candidate, maybe he dropped out too soon.  Sanders will be unable to accomplish anything except gridlock.﻿

He's not the typical white man from the good-old-boys  club. He's genuinely progressive, and will fight for legislation that will  help not only every american, but in particular communities which suffer  inordinately in terms of unemployment and taxation. He's your candidate.  Hillary is bad for us, anyone on the right is bad for us regardless their  color.  #BernieSanders2016﻿

But he will not be  able to win with the pseudo-science behind man-made climate change,  especially not with the development in California right now (natural  climate changes, and the inability with traditional liberal "progressive"  politics to plan for such things).

z12iv53rpk3axbtxt04chjnwjo2ysjxztu00k, 2015-04-14T02:53:56.170Z, Ted Cruz scares the fuck out of me. Say what you want about Obama and his  domestic policy but he's made great strides as far as making Americans more  liked outside of the country.

z132d3pojsfvgnoha04cgn5r1uuhh3ba2jo, 2015-03-29T20:46:53.066Z, Republicans, this e-mail episode is not helping. 99.99% of the Democrats  that I know told me that they will love Warren but they will vote for  Hillary in seconds just to avoid a Republican president. In another word,  you're only feeding people that already hate Hillary and will never vote  for her anyway. The way I see it she is being attacked because she is a  woman. Jeff Bush and Scott Walker did it and nobody is attacking them. Why?﻿

z12vfl5hfpe5gpbcf22eh5ywmyyoy1pli, 2015-03-23T18:20:59.237Z, Ted Cruz doesn't give a single shit about anyone whose not giving him  single large donations over 100k. Also if one doesn't make individually  over 250k a year, voting for this guy wont increase ones wages or paycheck.  In fact look at all the red states and statistically educated people make  less and so do tradesmen and uneducated. ﻿

z12mynkpisedj50rg04cerpoeyqcyhyan4c, 2015-03-23T15:49:38.348Z, Cruz is by far the best candidate for President that we have had since  Ronald Regan. We desperately need him to mop up the disaster created by  Obama and to drastically cut back the profligate pig of a federal  government that otherwise will cause the collapse of our nation, and send  the power back where it belongs, with the state and local governments, and  to chastise the Muslim Hordes and socialist secular progressivism, and  restore traditional family values.  Go Ted Go!!!!﻿

I have  nothing against having a female president, but if this woman wins, this  country will fall, even faster than Obama. I hope I can reach out to  Democrats, by saying "Don't vote for her just because she's female and just  because she's a democrat". She is just as corrupt if not more than Obama  and Bush. ﻿

z12vddz53rfvuzxz204cebki2ki2ij55suc0k, 2014-01-14T06:20:32.714Z, Mother Theresa after finishing her life's work in India was asked, "with  poverty and illness worse than when you began, how does that defeat feel?"  She responded as Ted Cruz has, "God did not call me to be successful, but  to be faithful. That is foolishness to the interviewer who is perishing.     ﻿

Obamacare rollout  was botched but I'm looking forward to rubbing it in Rupublicans faces when  it succeeds. There were a few other things but I forget.﻿
z12sv5ajapz1itwag04cdfqjjse5ep4xspg0k, 2013-12-31T02:14:36.171Z,  Hopefully the idiots in the tea party mob nominate Ted Cruz for president  in 2016 - Hillary Clinton would defeat Ted Cruz by 20 million votes on Nov  8, 2016 if Ted Cruz ends up being her opponent in 3 years.  Ted Cruz is a disgrace to America & Canada.﻿

z13ryh445q3zj1stv23ivr2pjsuodrqbm04, 2013-11-07T05:22:54.963Z, It is disappointing to hear that Ted Cruz disparages Rand Paul to donors in  private. Obviously Rand cares about Rands campaign and Ted cares about Teds  campaign, so I guess you can't blame Ted for wanting donor money for  himself over Rand. It's just something that rubs people the wrong way.   I might lean towards Rand in 2016.﻿

z133u1kjjqzshtszv04cera5mm31cdlagdw, 2015-11-13T05:18:30.959Z, Thank you, Ted Cruz, for advocating capitalism and rejecting the fake  old-Nazi dogma about a "behavioral gene".﻿
z12vj3rodwrnvpkcp23pjprxvku4hhkdd, 2015-11-05T22:58:26.729Z, So there it is...everything Ted Cruz said on the floor about our corrupt  leadership and how they operate was just admitted once again at :43 into  the video. And while he (Ryan) says he's gonna change it...we know that's  bullshit. At least the partial truth is coming out...but fuck people...﻿

Discrimination is illegal and the things you say have  consequences when you are CEO and owner of corporations and Trump is  learning that the hard way.

This will not work, I'm afraid. In fact, I'm  going to go on a limb and say Ted Cruz will be the first candidate to drop  from the race. Why? He was not born in the U.S., therefore, he doesn't meet  the basic qualifications. Bye Ted.﻿

The Republican base won’t  accept him because he is Hispanic, Hispanics won’t accept him because the  Tea Party and Republican Party won’t accept them and the general electorate  won’t elect him because of his rhetoric.  He will do well in the South and Central West, get killed everywhere else  and get gutter stomped in the Electoral College.  He is "add water and stir" defeat.﻿

Thanks to Regan's "Big Umbrella", I've watched the lunatic fringe drag the  party farther and farther to the right, to the point where the Republican  Party is no longer the party of the college educated but the party of  religious zealots and big money.  If Cruz gets the nomination I will leave the party.  I don't care if the  Democrats run Warren, I'd vote for her before I voted for a dog-whistler  like Cruz.﻿

z13vhlxb0qu5ilaz504cgbsxyt23ejpgpes, 2014-11-11T01:51:06.450Z, Senator Ted Cruz says "Net Neutrality is Obamacare for the internet..."  Only an idiot believes that. The Republicans need the vote of the people to  get into congress, but their true masters are corporations. Republican  voters proves that America isn't great, but full of fools who vote against  their own interest solely for the sake of hating the president. They are  the most gullible idiots on the planet. ﻿
z133ed3prmy3iz52b23xw3eg3pjkhzus2, 2014-11-11T00:21:27.832Z, Is this article missing something? The first half is praising Obama for  taking a stance on protecting the internet, but the second half is about  3rd parties commenting that Obamas goal is control. What am I suppose to  take from this?﻿
z12vitbapuu4yjcpr04ce1epqxjcwt2w4h0, 2014-11-10T22:25:38.943Z, We are going to get more internet freedom by implementing more regulations?  Only a dumbass progressive could find logic in something so stupid. More  freedom comes from less laws, not the exact opposite. ﻿

Voters will tolerate goofy mayors that do drugs and  fall down drunk. They will for awhile tolerate politicians that email  photos of their genitals or governors that are corrupt, but never some  buffoon that runs his mouth and bullies as president. NEVER.﻿

DON'T do that Random Paul,  Ted Cruz bull. Tell them  how you think vets shouldn't get benefits of anykind. Random have chosen to  keep quiet about this now.

z12ui3ia2x2vgrstw230epjjgkjhdzven, 2014-03-06T15:31:10.859Z, It was apparent from the 1st day of the obama admin that there is a  resolving door between wall street and the WH.  It is a culture of  corruption that Obama promised to break.  The non transparency is  astounding.  Anyone who disagrees with what Cruz has said here, is part of  the problem, but too stupid to recognize it.  Sheeple need to begin using  their brain on their own and stop drinking the koolaid.﻿

z12eylnilmiewrdj504cdfqjjse5ep4xspg0k, 2014-03-04T23:01:55.921Z, john Mccain, Ted Cruz, Sean Hannity & Rand Paul could not find Ukraine on a  world map if their lives depended on it.  Mccain, Sarah Palin & Ted Cruz could not attain president Obama's knowledge  of foreign policy if they lived to the age of 500.  Listening Mccain, Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin & Dick Cheney prattle about foreign  policy is like listening to Donald Trump & Newt Gingrich for marital  advice. ﻿

Ted Crud and his father both have a long history of  cowardliness, puss guts, verbal incontinence, and short stature.

Turkish speakers on other credible websites debunked the notion that the  fans were booing they claimed that they were chanting defiant slogans  against their perceived enemies.

z132srbzlzafstjlm22lx1davv33z3hp204, 2015-11-09T18:39:31.327Z, Thank god Ted Cruz will never be President...he has s TINY chance of  winning the Republican nomination, but no chance of winning the general  election if he does win...!﻿

z13wf1ahuym4f5zrk04cdv1yoovyupyqg3k, 2015-11-09T03:44:18.953Z, The right wing Republican Evangelical Christian agenda is the second  coming. Hence the "unquestioned" support of Israel.

z13fd3oofvmujnon322ptlgokse2gdn2j, 2015-11-04T03:31:48.532Z, The FOX owners know that under free-market capitalism their business  monopoly will fall to smaller competitors. As a result, they would be more  happy with Hitlary or Jeb Bush or Trump than with Ted Cruz.﻿

z12wyv0ootf3yxwef22ntd2gvnmjgz55i04, 2015-11-02T23:18:26.976Z, TED CRUZ initiated that whole attack on the liberal media. All the other  FOLLOWED HIM. Not Trump, nor Rubio, nor this Carson LEAD the way...they  followed TED CRUZ. CRUZ IS THE REAL LEADER AND PROVED IT BEYOND A DOUBT  CENTER STAGE. Dont support these glory thieves! SUPPORT TED CRUZ, THE REAL  LEADER.﻿
z13wsl24vq3azjjqz04cilqaapyzftagiws0k, 2015-11-02T22:35:28.865Z, Sean Hannity's hostility to reality is just so hostile. Ted Cruz is hostile  to the truth: congress does by it's very nature have a few people in the  leadership. ridiculous statement. I have a right to be hostile to Cruz, who  has a right to be hostile to reality, but not on my dime. golden  parachute?! did boener get a cherry retirement? ha mixing metaphors and  crybabying. lol﻿

z12bxpry5memdjjep22be31qbpudurkbd04, 2015-10-31T17:12:37.167Z, Actually Trump was first to call out the media and the PC crowd since the  very first debate not Ted Cruz but Mr. Cruz did a good job on calling out  the media and Mark and Trump and Chris. This debate was one of the best  that I have ever scene and I'm sure the liberalcratic CNBC just wanted to  make the GOP look bad but instead it back fired. As for the Democrats  debate, its like watching window paint dry. I hope the lame stream media  keeps exposing themselves for what they are. Go GOP.﻿
z13xhhqr4pzoclnfx22vwtwjmt3cf1rlx, 2015-10-31T08:29:29.532Z, This debate will go down in History specially Ted Cruz comment. It will  forever change how moderators behave in debates.﻿
z135shi5dsydsb4hh04cd1hakx2lev2wkns0k, 2015-10-31T06:45:27.257Z, I loved it when they set these unprofessional moderators were set in their  place.! I loved it when Ted Cruz gave the the moderators an ass whoopin!  The moderators were so unprofessional and did not ask questions the people  wanted to hear about resolving any problems in our country. The 30 second  and 1 minute responses is also ridiculous.﻿
z133cxryuli2vn4sg22cfdobcoeqsr44y04, 2015-10-31T06:35:33.997Z, Everyone I have talked were so disgusted with the questions that the  moderators gave. I loved it when they set these unprofessional moderators  in their place.! I loved it when Ted Cruz gave the the moderators an ass  whoopin! The moderators were so unprofessional and did not ask questions  the people wanted to hear about resolving any problems in our  country. The 30 second and 1 minute responses is also ridiculous.﻿

z13wvtpaavunvbr3q23eiphrdlzahrlap04, 2015-10-30T19:26:06.950Z, O'Reilly is wrong. Ted Cruz was more than willing to answer the question,  John Harwood blocked him over and over. He also answered that same question  from Brett Bair the next day. What Ted did changed the tone of the debate  completely. Before that, people were actually answering the stupid  questions on the moderators terms.﻿
z123z1shxrb2szrts23hu5ui4l3hip3ib04, 2015-10-30T18:30:29.626Z, President Trump / V.P. Ted Cruz 2016﻿
z12ozpabyr2chzafu22pv3ah0prqzhbvt, 2015-10-30T17:31:21.480Z, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Laura Ingram, Michael Savage,  these are the moderators that we should be using to vet these candidate.  That won't happen however because then the republican voters would see the  RINO's unveiled and the RNC can't have that.﻿
z13ivji4mkrwwd2vq23yz3iptr3yixeqq04, 2015-10-30T16:22:17.009Z, With so many media sources the so call main stream media myth is just a cop  out for republican "Cry Babies" who want to pass blame for their  inadequacies. Ted Cruz is acting like a child and a stupid Texas  politician. Stop passing blame and stand up! Cry Babies can not be  President!!!!!﻿
z12hgdroynmvib5dt23bv1paov35g1jyk04, 2015-10-30T15:59:28.041Z, Cruz was born in Canada. You do still need to be a natural born citizen to  be president or did I miss something? Somebody help me with this.﻿
z12xj3mixl20zputa23qy1jzlzrhu3gye04, 2015-10-30T15:47:54.410Z, I like that they said they should ask them questions about their tax plans.  That's exactly the question Ted Cruz is responding too. These people are a  joke.... Moderator: "Cruz, how about your tax plan?" Cruz: "Fucking liberal  media". Fox News: "Fucking liberal media, won't even ask about their tax  plans."﻿
z13ehrvjhsu2jdu1y23zfp3hguyvyvxh404, 2015-10-30T12:40:42.898Z, Jeb Bush stinks of desperation. His weakness on illegal immigration makes  him an extremely unappealing candidate. Can't wait till he drops out so his  points can go to other republicans.﻿
z13xshnz5sahy53pa04celrgbpjcxxhbii0, 2015-10-30T05:58:06.200Z, The only talking heads whining about the CNN moderators or their ?s are the racist, sexist, homophobic Republi -cans & their ilk. IMO the moderators were razor sharp & fact checked those blow hards around every turn. The 'debate' was awesome, but now I bet the next one will be stacked with right wing types & will be a total snooze fest, every one of these Republic bafoons getting on their soap boxes to run out the two hours st8 into an old re-run of "The Golden Girls."﻿
z12tzldwotvohnma304cdtcarozyuxvbgsw0k, 2015-10-30T05:14:55.631Z, Ted Cruz is full of shit﻿

z123y304twvtehfvp23etbbx2ymrjxwjz04, 2015-10-30T01:20:48.074Z, I really didn't care for Ted Cruz up till last night. His performance at  the debate blew me away.... Ted Cruz has my vote...﻿
z123ifapyprqsfgh404cdtvbimivz5kiafc, 2015-10-30T01:15:11.711Z, Go Ted represent the people not Washington.﻿
z13hjlaanlfjw5yqi04cezwgztnii5qqtas, 2015-10-30T00:53:42.621Z, The most unbearable man in politics. I agree that the moderators were  looking for a food fight, but they also asked these GOP punks to CLARIFY  their dumb positions. Like how you can make Mexico build a wall for us,  deport 11 million people and how we can afford your fairy tale tax policies  (which all of them enormously favor the rich)﻿
z12hyr040quowr13e220hfngkuq4fd5m5, 2015-10-29T23:36:59.514Z, CNBC illustrated a typical liberal mindset. Smug and ignorant at the same  time. They condescend while displaying their own ignorance and getting  their ass kicked. And their only retort is personal attack. That's why you  typically see that from them. They can't make a logical argument so they  attack personally showing their weakness.﻿
z12rjllrbyiowpfcg222thtzjpjkt5hhp04, 2015-10-29T23:16:08.145Z, I'd vote for Ben Carson, but Ted Cruz is my favorite. He and Mike Lee were  the only ones that stood against Democrats and the traitor Republicans on  Obama Care and tried to get things done.﻿

z12au1byczfjg1hz504cdxywmpnae324myc0k, 2015-10-29T22:10:54.129Z, He might make a Great Leader BUT if he starts to Piss off the really  powerful they'll Kill Him!﻿
z123z1eo2qvdylyfd22ljvobzvj0u50vu, 2015-10-29T18:33:12.228Z, Rubio needs to dropout - we can't rely on a man who never attends meetings.   The Used Car Salesmen Ted Cruz who's trying to usurp Rand Paul's supporters, and that hack George Pataki should follow suit.  Way too much deadwood. Let's get it down to a single debate.﻿
z13mszab1t21uzgd423hu5ui4l3hip3ib04, 2015-10-29T18:16:09.829Z, Senator Ted Cruz crucified the CNBC Moderators! Home Run! All of GOP questions is an attack. Contrast that with the Democrat Debate!  LOL Which one of you is the most Handsome & Wise ? President Trump / V.P. Cruz  2016﻿

z12gsjmg1z3wctc4004cf30yunqijlmwt0o, 2015-10-29T15:43:24.262Z, Ted Cruz is such a sour looking, pathetic, whining cunt! And yes, when  critiquing Ted Cruz that IS constructive criticism! Ted just because you're  on Fox "News", must you suck Sean Hannity's cock on air in front of the  whole country?﻿
z13me5dhyv3bjncl022eehbavsmogly20, 2015-10-29T15:22:40.631Z, "Snarky, obnoxious, hostile, snide, insulting." Wow - you just described  Megyn Kelly when Fox hosted the debate! Compared to the Fox panel, I think  CNBC did a far better job, and the candidates got to discuss real issues,  not "war on women" BS.﻿
z12cupwafnmmuv0qx04cctwjkqqkv1i4kho, 2015-10-29T14:32:04.745Z, Ted Cruz completely destroyed these moderators. I never thought I would say  that....The candidates shouldn't have to debate the damn moderators.﻿
z13mgt2qvqm4trer004cirubgwejcrmxehc, 2015-10-29T11:22:49.615Z, CNBC sucks true....but Fox News trying to school another network on Serious  Journalism ??!!? Haha fucken Laughable.  and "liberal media" is only catering to what most Americans want.  Republicans aren't popular anymore, Get Over it and Face the Facts.﻿

z13zudfq0tqxxlbrg04cebap0qbpjhhqjpg0k, 2015-10-27T18:32:55.746Z, Boy, Fox is really scared of Ted Cruz. Even though he is #3 on their poll,  they cut his name out and only show Rubio and Bush as if Cruz didn't even  register. I bet this anchor got in trouble for accidentally verbally  mentioning that Cruz was in 3rd place. Fox should be ashamed.﻿

z122x3nx3oiftbyhv04ce5zikzzhw3co3jc, 2015-10-24T18:02:01.171Z, Got a lot of respect for Mr. O'Reilly.  But the GOP Gong Show has simply went far right, and these talking points  are pathetic. Mental patients like Trey Gowdy and the user car salesmen Ted  Cruz, along with Ben Carson & Donald Trump (2 individuals with no  experience, or relevant credentials,) among others, have made the GOP a  partisan disaster which morphed into a train wreck reality show.﻿
z120uncrru21tpzqm04cjbjxyunwfdrivxg0k, 2015-10-24T17:55:00.462Z, Ted Cruz: unable to lead, unable to follow, and always in the way...in  other words, a real asshole.﻿
z13mgh1jtnediresp22wetehqqj1yxhxg04, 2015-10-24T14:37:37.364Z, By FAR Rubio's voting record is the worst among candidates. The guy has  been largely absent from the Senate.﻿
z13vz1zjxvf1ydr34231d3bqfnvefd22q, 2015-10-24T13:31:21.596Z, Yep, Doesn't Jeb Bush and Hillary look better now... Common look at how bad  of a surgeon Ben Carson Was. Look at how trump treats woman. Look at how  bad Ted Cruz has treated his counter parts in the senate. This is the  message from fox news....﻿

z13wcxj5yte0yfn0m22ptlgokse2gdn2j, 2015-10-24T02:32:30.933Z, Thank you, Ted Cruz, for rejecting the fake old-Nazi dogma about a  "behavioral gene."﻿

z12zx3ryinq0tvbxe04cerggto2qyvxozj4, 2015-10-22T02:07:57.425Z, Mitch McConnel is a spineless RINO who is more concerned with being in  Obama's good graces than for standing up for protecting the American  people. Ted Cruz is the only candidate other than Trump that would shake up  DC the most. Sink the RINOS﻿

z135td35ftazsbifa23bzx5onzu1ttv2z, 2015-10-21T06:13:09.277Z, I'm not sure how that will work when 60% of the GOP base have unfavorable  views of him. It's even worse outside of the GOP. He may win the  nomination, but the democrats could run a brick against him and still win.﻿

z122h5prilzjclers04cera5mm31cdlagdw, 2015-10-20T19:46:10.192Z, Back in May or June, Ted Cruz published Karl Rove's emails as a refutation  of Roves' lies. Karl should not open his mouth after he was publicly caught  in a lie.﻿

Newsflash, Cruz-  people don't vote for you because you're a backwards idiot, they don't vote  for you because you are shitty person with stupid beliefs and a terrible  personality- you exhibit the leadership skills of a mentally handicapped  blind piglet lost in a maze. It has nothing to do with other candidates or  the media- you suck because you suck.﻿

z13fylabdxnyuf3un23scf1bcvigerwss, 2015-10-01T23:52:41.031Z, Ted Cruz is spot on with his analysis on Islam, the excuses they say and  use when causing riotous killings its pure bullshit.Islam wants to take  over the world it is nothing more than a evil cult and you dont want  Muslims in power because they will use that to push thier Islamic influence  on the world. Christians need to fight these evil bastards and stop them.  I'm glad America have woken up to this its a shame UK are too stupid to  realise this.﻿

z13xuxhxnxefv5gcf23dhtwypvm4ulyor04, 2015-10-01T04:01:53.654Z, Ted Cruz thinks that he is sanctified...makes him sound authentic...but no  one is buying his dimwit logic...look at his poll numbers ( gone from 10%  to 6 %)...pathetic... with the " I'm amazed that I am so blessed" ( sin of  pride, by the way ) crap that you can hear in any abandoned mall church in  the country.

Of course, a Muslim could be  President and I would support he/she if they supported America.  Majority  determines the Elected Officials in America, you can't please everybody.   This is the first time I've heard this CAIR jerk speak out about anything.   Has he said anything positive about America?  Has he said anything publicly  against slaughter of Christians by Muslims?﻿

z12yzvggkyu2xj3m522gj30rrtesixz4j04, 2015-09-22T07:29:41.383Z, Ted Cruz is saying the same thing. Obama loves, apologetic, too weak,  etc... with Muslims and Radical Islam, and the world now is trembling down,  how much more if an open true Muslim would lead America.

z12ugbdbdqfafdu1322zdhlxdrrofjv4q04, 2015-09-22T02:12:46.890Z, Again, the media blows a simple opinion by Mr. Carson completely out of  proportion. In addition, the sound bites edits out the context as to WHY he  said what he said. Why is it a top story? Ratings. Pure & simple. However,  the blonde lady is definitely offering a clearer understanding of Carson's  remarks than that guy named Rivera, who thrives on fallacies.﻿
z12vvllrnzbzcbose23ytrzzhoj0vpkha04, 2015-09-22T02:11:12.472Z, Cruz, I read your book. I have to admit, I skipped most of it--I didn't buy  it to get a family biography. I was interested in your Senate experience. I  like you as a Senator. I don't think you would make a good president. I  simply cannot stomach another politician.

Then Fox attacks all the principled outsiders, Trump, Carson (this  surprised me because I thought Carson did well and I'm a Trump fan so it  exposes Krauthammer for his phony establishment views), and a backhanded  compliment to Rand, but then goes on to compliment Christie's pathetic  night. Christie did NOT look good...﻿

"I thought he didn't do well in the first  debate" says Krauthammer, which of course means he's clueless because after  the first debate Trump soared. Nothing "got lost in the shuffle" as Kraut  said. People heard Trump's answers and more and more began liking him. More  and more republicans are realizing that it's best to vote for a  non-politician. So Trump, Carson and Fiorini will be the top 3 and 2 of  them will comprise the ticket﻿

"I am Muslim and I  refuse to give a drivers license to a woman." "I worship Gozer the Gozerian  I must kill a child as sacrifice. I have religious freedom."

z12ox5p4vtm3g3q5t04cibzyvuuwid2md, 2015-09-05T19:13:23.488Z, I figured after last weeks revealing the trump was lying about how much  money he had, lying about his plans, lying about his families mob  connections, and lying about basically everything he said since he started  talking as an infant that he would be out of the race.

Then at the same type they treat Ayn Rand as if she was some type of  priestess of Conservatism and Democracy.

I agree, people  like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz should not be citizens of this country. At  the very least they should be forced to change their names to something  more American.

Donald  Trump is not a puppet and does not have to fear to tell you the truth.  As  well, trump could expose the corruption of some politicians and can use  this against them.  They have nothing on him that would cause his  downfall.  Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and Trump are sincere and would love them  to work together and get our country back.

He said that single payer would have worked in America fifteen  years ago. He didn't say it was a mistake to support it, he said he was  right to support single payer then. That makes no sense. How can so many  conservatives support this man? Especially when there are better  candidates!﻿
z13wvfmhmq3csxya104cd3lhbq2ouli4bjo, 2015-08-07T21:17:36.374Z, Ted Cruz had no clue but not that I blame him.

Or maybe win-win  depending on how you look at it.﻿

z12cuztwqsiodlddf22sf5gb5r3ze5kit04, 2015-08-07T14:39:37.604Z, I find it ironic that Ted Cruz says he'll fight for religious liberty and  then say he fights Planned Parenthood. So religious liberty includes  putting a stop to things you don't like. ﻿
z12fxribrnr1evopr04cjx3a4qfuh15ycuc0k, 2015-08-07T14:31:27.890Z, Ted Cruz is right in his answer ...and he is willing to put his finger on  the problem, that is important, PC will only get you murdered, telling the  truth puts a spotlight on the bad guys and tells them up front, we don't  trust you and will be watching you, and you will pay for your misdeeds even  if you say your god told you to do it!﻿

z132xjgb5nbjilcpf04cctcptq2uid25oi4, 2015-08-07T04:02:11.780Z, I think Ben Carson did a great job for someone who has never been in the  spotlight like this before. Unfortunately because of Obama I think it will  be decades before America is willing to elect another African=American as  president as sad as that is because there is several good black  conservatives.﻿

z12ezjvg5zqrepiro04cgz0obo3sdzcbryk0k, 2015-06-26T20:33:22.682Z, I am an Atheist AND A REPUBLICAN!  The Republican Party will not re gain  power until the party is purged of religious fundamentalists. Religious  fundamentalism and theocracy is NOT CONSERVATIVE... also not  constitutional. True REPUBLICANS must fight RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM so  we can  move away from Leftist collectivism and move towards Liberty and  Individuality.

z133xvgzvwilerbcb23jcbpwftm5v5iqk04, 2015-01-21T19:19:24.904Z, Dear Republicans, Tea Party, conservatives and fundamentalists: Prepare yourselves, you have a minimum of 10 more years of Democrat  leadership. Once Hillary declares she'll run for president, it's all over  for you. Barry is witty, uses humor wisely, and speaks so eloquently. This was one  of the best state of the union addresses, ever! He sure scored big with his  comment: "I have no more campaigns to run...I know because I won both of  them". BOOM﻿

z13uhxwgctbgflirk04cib0q1pb4inmx1u40k, 2015-12-01T05:04:49.211Z, When you see how hard main stream media is trying to slander Ted Cruz it is  a clear indication that some, if not all, of his views are valid.﻿
z12jy1ei3rffgltfm23gw5pgllehs1gsj, 2015-12-01T04:37:39.274Z, Here is my theory on motive - the man is really the Sasquatch. After  receiving a Rocky Mountain high from his bud, he got the severe munchies  for baby back ribs. This is why the news keeps saying he uttered "BABY  PARTS". He probably sounded like a cave man for example - "Mmmmm me need  baby part me hungry".  Theory makes more sense than Ted Cruz's claim that he's a left wing tranny  who is really a woman.﻿

z123gdt4lnvlsbhrz04chxrxnurssbhhlok0k, 2015-11-29T20:28:04.817Z, Ted Cruz's theatrics to help shutdown the Syrian refugees has caused other  programs to be shutdown as well.

If they fail to understand our country, fail to  speak our language, and fail to behave like a good citizen, then they're  going back to where ever they came from.﻿

Is that way nearly every  respected military commander including former republican Secretary of State  Colin Powell said its a good deal... Ted Cruz is nothing but a radical  neocon who makes the Republican Party look like bigoted war mongering  morons. I'd take Rand Paul over this trigger happy Canadian any day﻿

z12qvpnocpvccf3ot04cfh04uu3sz5f4dk40k, 2015-09-26T13:34:07.742Z, Look at all these ignorant Americans. Ted Cruz is a puppet, not a  conservative. War mongering politicians... Iran is the most heavily  inspected country in the world when it comes to nuclear production. I  didn't hear him mention that! The Iranians are noble, and don't let this  blatant propaganda get the better of you!﻿

z13kyjggsre4shceq231hvl5lumysdrkj, 2015-09-23T06:57:27.688Z, how come no matter how many good ideas conservative politicians have,  liberals, news media, and talk show hosts (including Colbert) hound on the  fact that they are against gay marriage. It's a deep rooted religious  belief people! and Ted Cruz is right! Courts cannot and should not make  laws. I don't favor gay marriage, but I won't stand against it either if  certain states favor it. So why not just let each individual states decide  whether they want to adopt gay marriage or not﻿
z13etlupfsr3zjfco23bwx0jsrjrepfbw04, 2015-09-23T03:14:48.033Z, Ted Cruz secretly craves cock.﻿
z12sdlfixw22ffadq230dzvppvrfsbqsy, 2015-09-22T23:11:38.118Z, Not surprised Colbert would let a guy like Cruz talk like that. As a highly  religious man himself, I wouldn't be surprised if he agrees with Ted (hence  the stopping of the boos).﻿

z13cerliwzqxdbx5h04cezwgztnii5qqtas, 2015-09-22T19:46:28.734Z, Ted Cruz is a fraud. He says he's for small government while denying women  to control their bodies and denying people the right to marry. He says he's  against Obamacare but he signed up for Obamacare himself. He says he's not  establishment but he is drowning in donor money. I'm glad this clown has no  chance to win in today's America.﻿
z12bdxyaskvvdjrtc22njfuz5w2mihsas04, 2015-09-22T18:43:37.662Z, Ted Cruz booo  The only way I would vote for Sanders would be if Cruz got nominated. But  neither will be so I'm good.﻿
z122it0hdw2xxftgf04cd5nwkyyevnaxerk0k, 2015-09-22T18:40:32.836Z, So the problem isn't the ever increasing intolerance of the left and how so  many are inclined to deny a voice to those with differing opinions? Well,  that's a relief. Nope, the problem is that some people have the 'wrong' opinions so all they  have to do is get the 'right' opinions and they can talk all they want.﻿

z13vinkydxapgvp3323rutf5sqfvibnws04, 2015-09-21T02:35:03.923Z, once again CNN trying to create the narrative with their push polls the  suggestion that walkers bad and Rubio Bush's conservative blocker is good  what experience does Marco Rubio even have and if the one of the real  conservative Latino they would obviously pick Ted Cruz but the Liberals  fear Ted Cruz too much so create the moderate we need never going to win  Rubio.

z12dxz0b5tuajnl1a224et14ur2qxlpp504, 2015-09-17T03:35:07.822Z, Ted Cruz is a political shill. These politicians need to grow a pair. This  whole issue is easy, audit planned parenthood! If they are following the  law and everything is legal, that's fine. If not then someone should go to  jail/be held accountable. Then they can have a discussion about funding. ﻿

I'm not a Trump  supporter, though - I think Ted Cruz better understands how the political  "game" works and he will have none of it, so I'm for Cruz. He's memorized  the Constitution, Y'all, and he's the only truly consistent Constitutional  conservative in the race who'll actually defend it. CRUZ 2016!!﻿

Every year the level of the republican candidates  goes down and now they seem to be hitting rock bottom. Then again, I  thought Palin was that bottom and maybe they go ahead and nominate someone  even less qualified and immoral next year, but I can't actually think of  anybody.

The Republican Party has  (or at least used to have) a sort of arbitrary and unwritten rule: The  party is very diverse and large, and in order to show unity they believe(d)  in what is known as "The 11th Commandment." Basically, a Republican  shouldn't ever bash another Republican, which is what Cruz refuses to do.﻿

There's no mystery why Trump is popular  among the GOP.  He, along with Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachman, Ted Cruz,  Rick Perry, etc. appeal to the kentucky fried Amuuurican voter who doesn't  care about anything other than lower brain-stem politics.

What is it that other people see in these men to make them believe they can  make a contribution to any conversation... much less an important one. Of  course that can be said about many of our public figures... Sarah Palin  immediately comes to mind.﻿
z13dzxlwxzjmxnwnw23zwprgxqf5sdjzw04, 2015-05-20T20:14:20.990Z, As long as at least one of his parents was a US citizen it does not matter  where Obama was born.  Canadian born Ted Cruz with his Cuban father has  proved that by entering the 2016 Presidential race.  In addition, 2008  presidential candidate John McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone, and  1964 presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was born in Arizona before it  became at state.  Why wasn't the birther issue raised with regard to Ted  Cruz, John McCain and Barry Goldwater?﻿

People like Ted Cruz are what's wrong with america, and have been  for decades. The only black people they approve of are blacks who  regurgitate everything Bill O'Reilly says. ﻿

z12cxvuqfx2ovzpz104cfxhiazukdnzwitc0k, 2015-04-30T17:23:24.861Z, He didn't even answer the question. He said Obama made decisions, that inflamed racial tensions, but can't name  one example. He thought he could get away without an answer, but luckily the lady asked  him. He names Obamacare and the Iran Deal, which have nothing to do with race. Ted Cruz is pathetic.﻿

z12syxpjdtf2hz3kk230zljyiwzpyrxem, 2015-04-27T13:20:45.014Z, Ted Cruz the redneck will go against everything. Just quit politics and go  back to your farm. ﻿
z12tudvajwvzzfhmk22wy3nhikm0sf1j004, 2015-04-26T03:46:16.899Z, Obama's bail out plan failed. Obamacare is a complete failure. America more  divided now than ever in history. Obama where were you born? Nobody knows  where he came from. Father was a Muslim. Reverend Jeremiah Wright close  friend.

The Niggroes should  stop being criminals if they don't want to keep getting caught. We should  just send ALL of them back to Africa because NOBODY wants them here  destroying America. Mr. Obama has been encouraging this behavior in these  monkeys, so I blame Obama and his sidekick Lesbian, Hilary Clinton.  Ted Cruz 2016﻿

z13di1lgsy3wix1t323nfvgxnlnqep3cp, 2015-03-31T02:31:38.217Z, In reality, Peter King is a typical political hack who feels threatened  just as the Democrats do that Ted Cruz will reign in the accountability in  Washington, and employ brilliant ideas, just as he did at Harvard Law,  where he graduated top of his class.﻿

z13bhdehry25j5l4c04cchhy5sridvho3nw0k, 2015-03-26T16:12:51.229Z, Cruz is signing up for coverage through his employer, which just happens to  be the Federal Government. He is not enrolled in Obamacare, which is a  mandated single insurance coverage through a forced tax charge that you can  receive qualified subsidies through your state enrollment system, and you  would not enroll into if you have an employment option available to you.  This is very different than Obamacare, and the fact that a journalist  doesn't know that is shocking.﻿
z134gv044vqfizbwa04cj3khllzwt5rzfb4, 2015-03-26T07:52:40.384Z, Ted Cruz should have expected people would think the worst of his actions  even if he went on Obamacare to be noble, to be on the same healthcare as  the everyday American. ﻿

z13ns1igwxrlgtzu123uwrkyzyzuebesy, 2015-03-25T18:59:11.070Z, Ted Cruz receives coverage from the very same healthcare law which he shut  the federal govt down to repeal? It's like hypocrisy is a fundamental  principle of the modern GOP.﻿
z13kgh4yjvywxrhdw225ix5xoviezbkhh04, 2015-03-25T17:32:52.103Z, If Cruz had not obtained 0bamacare insurance and had opted not to have  insurance and payed the fine, liberals would have taken his children away  for neglect and abuse, and then thrown him in jail.﻿

z13ewv14lpz0vzelu22ic1150lykd50r504, 2015-03-23T15:19:09.025Z, Ted Cruz is not a politician that's why the media hates him, and we  conservative like him, he makes proud to be a Texan and also a American,  and y'all haters can Fuck off.﻿
z12adrngtqjpi1gn023svxmq2qqdivqvx, 2015-03-23T15:06:07.588Z, God Bless Ted Cruz and for the future of America and the whole world Vote  for the right person﻿

z13gxv0ixwqrgdhxs04chdyzywrxzxwytpo0k, 2015-03-23T13:59:56.793Z, Where are the birthers? Show us you didn't waste your time on Obama. We  have a foreigner running. His name is Ted Cruz.﻿
z12bgt4ygpn0in2tc222h1pbdyyth5xd2, 2015-03-23T13:41:39.423Z, How can he run, he was born in Canada. He wont win either way.  ﻿
z13ucvnjom3ifltbc04cdruguwjtw1rylno0k, 2015-03-23T13:41:38.346Z, Ted Cruz was born in Canada so he legally can't be US president or US vice  president.﻿
z12bczbralj3vh0qy04cclywtlqmchv5sow0k, 2015-03-23T13:14:11.190Z, Wow Ted Cruz is a complete dickhead.﻿
z13mxf1ywwqqc5nbk04cdvfqbvifxzsrwq00k, 2015-03-21T19:50:19.776Z, I understand we shouldn't always vote Dem but to say to vote Rep? He has to  be a fuckin idiot. Dems are just the lesser of the two evils. Don't say  vote Rep, say we need more options dickhead. Obviously the GOP paid you off  to become one of their House Negros aka bottom bitch. Any Black person that  follows your ignorant rhetoric deserves exactly what the outcome will be.  How about we look at more independent Candidates instead?﻿
z13lxlcporrvft2f4222ypfzbvbhtbjbo04, 2015-03-21T01:38:30.395Z, if Ted Cruz suggested this idea it would be considered racist by liberals.﻿
z13adhhhzmafjbz5a04cjdtbyk3jspla2yg0k, 2015-03-20T19:33:59.112Z, Ha ha, Marco Rubio is a joke,not as big a joke as Ted Cruz, but a funny  joke none the less.﻿
z12mdtqrzyfwdj5up221f1ehfuuuvbkuy, 2015-03-20T05:21:29.948Z, I think Jeb is our next president. Hillary will crack under the pressure of  media before the primaries, then they'll bring in Warren. They might as  well bring Ted Cruz if they bring Warren in, they'd have as good of a  chance. Jeb will win it, just watch. He don't need a translator to speak to  Hispanics, who are a conservative and traditional people by large.﻿
z13byvw4vvyztbyjf04cjfxyvpb3wbfxba4, 2015-03-17T19:55:14.089Z, I find it hard for techies such as engineers like myself to agree with this  man. I feel like he's missed the whole point of net neutrality. ﻿
z13ywbkacuartdhdb23uttrztpvgwlo33, 2015-03-15T03:24:23.100Z, Ted Cruz for President!﻿
z13fdlgibyiesfkqw04chjyrvozduzlg5jg, 2015-03-11T16:08:32.128Z, Wow. 2 months into power and the Republican leadership has consisted of  fighting over DHS funding, using snowballs to "disprove" climate change,  inviting a Prime Minister to bash the President, and now this. These next 2  years are going to be fun! I just know it!﻿
z13bhjprolmpyzogk04cepighrflsv5bg3w, 2015-03-05T21:26:20.015Z, Carson is history now. I knew he didn't have a backbone. TED CRUZ 2016!!!!﻿

z12jvt0o2pilfh3nt22dyzxwpvq5gmqc, 2015-03-03T22:25:39.117Z, Ted Cruz is an unlikable jerkoff.﻿
z133tjxg4svwghnpo04cev3zoluhi1horp00k, 2015-03-01T17:46:56.684Z, The big takeaway from those results is that those five only represent 78%  of the votes.  Where are the other 22%?  They are SOOOO  fractured!﻿
z12lhdqznnzycjzwu04cgrwaoyebyjpatlg0k, 2015-02-27T01:33:44.265Z, Whee!  The circle jerk has begun!  Who will lead the next tone deaf charge  for the White House? Will it be Jeb "George the Third" Bush?  Chris "let's  make a traffic jam" Christie?  Ted "not quite Tom" Cruz?  Scott "the jobs  are here you just can't see them" Walker?  And what will they do when  Hillary loses her presidential bid again, just like she always has?  Swipes  against Hillary and talk of "action" without substance seem to be all  they've got; without her, they've got nothing.﻿
z12lulpqiwzafhmsj23mcxwrjsrqyt5nt, 2015-02-27T01:24:40.294Z, Rafael Edward "Ted" Cruz is the shiftiest looking politician I have ever  seen. He also seems to be a complete moron, as well.﻿
z12ni1hbknrexv4ul23idl3w5liuyz0tu, 2015-02-26T22:57:24.446Z, Ted Cruz wasn't born in the USA!﻿
z13qgx3jloyawlild23fu5y41qzxuzftl, 2015-02-26T07:59:16.717Z, Hillary Clinton has absolutely alienated the Democratic base. She's  thoroughly corrupt and I could not bring myself to vote for her, no matter  how bad the Republican candidate is. I will not be a party to choosing  between the likes of Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz.﻿
z12rzzopztvxzd0ix04chjcrskavzrfxja4, 2015-02-26T07:57:35.166Z, Wow, one of the few intelligent comments that has come out of Michelle  Bachman's mouth. Christ that woman is stupid. Clinton should be nervous.  She's a complete sell-out and I want her in office about as much as I want  Ted Cruz, perhaps one of the few politicians more corrupt than Hillary. I'd  love to see Warren in the White House. ﻿
z13qxbagxm3hthxyb04cjb3zozjojl1xofw, 2015-02-16T13:42:16.097Z, Rather Jeb then any of Tea party nuts like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.﻿

z12kuve5lov4zrzih04cdhqzwuimd11i540, 2015-02-08T18:38:34.009Z, Hey, Tea-Party fucktards. Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President of the  U.S. anyway because he was born in CANADA! You know, the other country  Sarah Palin can see from her house.﻿

z13eunc40wihijzee23sxtpqlw3ltdsdp, 2015-01-29T02:42:16.789Z, TED CRUZ IS A HARVARD EDUCATED CHARLATAN WHOSE WIFE WORKS AS AN EXECUTIVE AT GOLDMAN SACKS.

The economy, taxes, and immigration are  important, but the main reasons I went conservative were abortion and gay  marriage. I'm avidly against both. Please, Republicans don't let me down!

Obama was able to get the funding he needed to jump start the  economy, save the auto industry, and bailout banks. Republican House  majority, we have government shutdown that cost the economy $22 Billion.  Senator Ted Cruz's filibuster was 21 hours and 19 minutes. He was reading  'Green Eyes and Ham'. We don't need this in Congress. Nowadays nothing gets  done. Wake up people!﻿

Jeb Bush is no conservative  and Ted Cruz is cool, but Rand Paul would be the most conservative  candidate for the 2016 presidential primaries.﻿

z121h3ebnyfgyhssb224itqievuah5usl, 2014-07-31T01:37:38.373Z, For fucks sake, get of your ass and find something better to do than HURT  your county! Didnt republicans say they are for the US? This is a waste of  time, waste of tax money, and just pointless. Crisis is all over the world,  dont do this, I have lost virtually the last shred of respect for  republicans. They are holding this country back.﻿
z12sinkwfxbxtvtza04cgrnwpsyxdthra3g, 2014-07-30T18:16:45.599Z, I'm glad that we voted him in -- twice! That almost makes up for 12 years of Bush.﻿
z12ch1q4swezcxzez222wfqj2pi3hflsn, 2014-07-24T18:13:41.060Z, I generally disagree with Ted Cruz, but here I agree. ﻿

z13zz5potpmdfttpz04cjbtq2saldrkomqw0k, 2014-07-10T17:10:07.766Z, The GOP will do what they always do.  Complain, do nothing and then blame  Obama (if he does something or if he doesn't do something).  ﻿
z13fzbbycxe4txysp23sizdy1vysttqdd, 2014-07-10T14:40:22.309Z, "A bad photo opt?"  What?  So, he's more concerned about taking pictures  than taken care of the citizens who live in Texas!  POS﻿
z124g1fp0rvviz1ph04cihip5uuqxpmo3kc0k, 2014-07-08T20:32:56.744Z, Why are you listening to Ted Cruz?﻿
z12ptnywluicclrfu225sjpj4zjvt1ttz, 2014-07-03T15:00:52.800Z, The only thing he did was defending someone's right of prejudice (which is  kinda fair), but we've never seen Rand Paul mention anything about people  other than "poverty is tough love". The only person in Congress who's done  the most for the people is Bernie Sanders. If someone can point out  anything Rand Paul did for minorities and the LGBT community I'll eat my  words, but as far as I'm concerned the Pauls say anything just to get a  vote﻿

z13xwfoo2xqishyhi04cdnzorxfmhhyjmvo0k, 2014-06-25T10:45:03.500Z, Gotta love Ted.  Left wing nut jobs hate him because he exposes their  corrupt, tyrannical and foolish leaders who want to control every aspect of  our lives. ﻿
z13vfxkwowazwntmb22jtpx5xvbfvtmrk04, 2014-06-24T17:39:12.931Z, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz for 2016 lets get Americas pride back that obama has  thrown away lets get our economy back that obama has destroyed and lets  repeal obamacare that caused millions of Americans to loose their health  insurance.﻿
z12uujwppn3jt13uv23lzzqyqr3mcomc, 2014-06-24T14:38:14.882Z, The problem with spoken language is what's in parenthesis often goes  unheard- what he meant was "Ted Cruz is a very intelligent guy (for a Texas republican)". That doesn't  say much.﻿
z13jgb3jpoi5stqnp23pen3r1x2lddaog04, 2014-06-24T04:42:00.939Z, Ted Cruz is so far right of the Republican Party, ie the Tea Party, which  is not the majority of the Republican Party, and will certainly turn off  Independents. So, go ahead a run Ted, Suess, Cruz.﻿

Hahahaha, your show is canceled because it sucked.  Piers took the highest  rated CNN show in history and ran it into the ground, then got fired for  it. That is funnier than the Ted Cruz crack.﻿

z13ijbfzarjhx1jyo04cfrzaas2oxvp5ym00k, 2014-05-31T03:00:51.931Z, Bill Clinton is a CIA scumbag criminal. Him attacking Ted Cruz is a  compliment to Ted Cruz. The leadership of both parties are run by the same  people. Most of the Republicans are controlled and/or blackmailed into  shutting up and doing as they're told. It takes a lot of guts for people  like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul to stand in the face of the corporate  controlling elite that run the system.  #infowars﻿

z12utdeottq4v5ykm22vz1eidrrtjfuiw04, 2014-04-25T20:35:32.270Z, Ted Cruz stated on television C-Span that the senate should have another 49  Jesse Helms in the senate; a racist, sexist, adulterer, rapist who forced a  black woman to have his love child. Good going so called man of god (the  lesser god-Satan).﻿
z12yddmqxpjhcnf5o04ciho5areqwjlwsmw0k, 2014-04-23T19:13:37.090Z, Bob Dole is right. We need to stop having garbage cans like Ted Cruz if the  republican party wants to be a national party. ﻿
z125jr2rqkqhwxymr23sdvqwvxqmslhjg04, 2014-04-23T16:27:38.087Z, NO, you NEOCONS are the extreme right wing. I don't know what Ted Cruz is  yet but he is still pretty brainwashed by the NWO...﻿

z12yxvaz5ozdynq4q04cgh4prnnhgtciis00k, 2014-04-23T13:54:57.370Z, I find it very entertaining when loony leftists like Bob Dolt get their  panties in a wad and spew their verbal menstruation when real Americans  object to their evil ruling class way of life.﻿
z12ncpyz5qvusvtfl23gdlzbjz3dx51gp04, 2014-04-17T03:00:22.530Z, Clinton you old whore-monger hillbilly bastard! Had Ted Cruz been around  when you had your impeachment trial he would of made a big monkey out of  you! ﻿
z12cchxpioezgh2vs22vftdyazirspyul, 2014-04-16T23:10:06.139Z, Ted Cruz should absolutely not be criticizing or working on AMERICAN  policies when first of all, he is CANADIAN. If he so badly worries about  conservative views and immigration, why doesnt he go back to Canada,  control its borders before judging anybody else. Hypocrite. ﻿
z13df5mpolipuzl2d23divvqzmryyrlz304, 2014-04-14T20:02:08.658Z, Ted cruz is an illegal immigrant! kick him out!﻿
z12tdzgqssagclirl04cilxo3yvzjxhzbqw0k, 2014-04-14T13:14:51.026Z, How about Ted Cruz do something to improve the U.S. instead of just  campaigning. He has done nothing but hurt this Country. Why would you think  he would do any different if he was in a higher position in the Government.  He wouldn't. He is a cancer...brought to you by a Texan.﻿

With his connection to Cuba, he understands  what communism is all about and how evil it is. Dictators worldwide feel  emboldened with kindred spirit Obama Democrats in office ﻿

Clinton was an impeached President  man-whore who stood for nothing and got nothing accomplished. His wife is a  roll-over fool who cares less for herself than acquisition of power.

Very little do you get  to see politicians with good character traits and the talent to solve  problems. Obama is nothing like that. Every time something bad comes up,  it's always Bush's fault or the Republican's fault. We need a new president  that actually cares for the American people..﻿
