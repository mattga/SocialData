If you had a son and  a police shot him unjustly and it took a whole year for them to do anything  about it... I'm sure you'd want people to speak out.

All the money Bush has and all the rationale she thinks she has in her  little brain won't be able to save Bush or kasich or Rubio the sneaky  snake.

z12ed31qsl2kebtxo04cfzq5vxb4v3oo5ss0k, 2015-11-24T18:43:46.395Z, Really Rubio? Wow I cant believe this is actually someone running for  president ﻿
z125jhbgzomzv5jj204cdltamniyunbbppw0k, 2015-11-24T18:41:06.933Z, Turkey would no longer be a member of NATO after their acts against Russia  which is trying to destroy ISIS,And what little respect I had for Rubio is  now gone.﻿
z12cv50xkoaogbavr23vjhbaypb0dlqat04, 2015-11-24T16:49:24.903Z, Question for trump supporters (genuine question, not a gotcha question):  Should trump decide to run against the republican party as an independent,  would he still have your support?﻿
z12jxjdqhwncd3eza04chrsabz3ihnkpeuk0k, 2015-11-24T16:39:46.104Z, i actually agree with rubio about who we are not at war with, and that the  radical murders must be destroyed.﻿
z12txfvyiq2bjnlp104chhuoernwjtihwug0k, 2015-11-24T16:36:49.342Z, In the RCP average Rubio wins Hillary in all swing states. Trump and Cruz  lose all of them. Good luck GOP.﻿
z12ywbgxtozludi1323pylvb2nu5wrene, 2015-11-24T14:59:01.397Z, When Marco Rubio speaks, it's so Rehearsed and fake. What an empty suit of  a politician he is.﻿
z13ygfgq2lamthyde23ccvryvrmtxrybl04, 2015-11-24T14:56:19.592Z, When O’Reilly is the voice of reason you know things are fucked up.﻿

z12khvxypqevgjiel23ksdcg5nqve1ps4, 2015-11-24T09:50:58.332Z, Marco Rubio is Absolutely RIGHT﻿
z124xnewjkuyvltdg23kujjiounvw1bnr, 2015-11-24T09:32:35.448Z, Rubio Fiorina ticket!!! Damn, that'd be awesome, a hispanic and a woman,  groups that destroy the left's identity politics, PC rhetoric, and  stigmatization. The GOP could beat Hilary twice with that ticket.﻿
z123zxxoxwfkir1hz04ci3dxxunejjk4yiw, 2015-11-24T09:15:55.734Z, Rubio Fiorina ticket!!! Damn, that'd be awesome, a hispanic and a woman,  groups that destroy the left's identity politics and stigmatization. The  GOP could beat Hilary twice with that ticket.﻿
z131hvqw5qvdutzts23kujjiounvw1bnr, 2015-11-24T09:13:02.075Z, Rubio 2016. Even the NY times said Rubio scares Dems! He's the only  candidate that can surely defeat Hillary in the general as far as I'm  concerned. He's articulate, he's smart, with an inspiring story, and young  with fresh ideas.﻿
z13zs1xptuqbxhazv04cgnzbqmrnhxgjvms0k, 2015-11-24T07:42:56.901Z, Pretty obvious Rubio is an establishment puppet by and the amount of time  he gets on fox. F Obama, F the NWO, F fake republicans, F the police, F  drone pilots who fly over America, F fox.﻿
z121ylopcqajsbt5g04cd5rinvqffbyqlh0, 2015-11-24T05:11:49.787Z, Good thing Rubio still loses against Bernie Sanders nation wide, which is  ignored by FOX... I wonder why that is?﻿
z121t3wwst3ewhi2523sx3gaqwq3f10pf04, 2015-11-24T04:50:49.600Z, See what you have done Fox News? You keep pushing false numbers on Rubio  beating Clinton and they come here to cuddle and giggle about it, then  attack Republicans.  BTW: I enjoyed your segment Gretchen.﻿
z12li1uxhvzrjlfub22le154rrfothqup, 2015-11-24T04:49:57.835Z, I would conjecture that the polls show Rubio looking good against Hillary  because some of the females (or gay, MSM males) who might otherwise vote  for Hillary think Rubio is "cute" (remember Palin? Kennedy? Melania? Looks  matter...)﻿
z130zz1jipvldtuay04cj3ohkuvmshg42pg0k, 2015-11-24T04:35:42.634Z, I'd take Florina over Rubio, but neither over #Trump.﻿

z13mwnbrzu3gw3c3n23uwrkyzyzuebesy, 2015-11-24T02:29:42.880Z, Trump couldn't handle debate moderators yet he expects us to believe he can  handle ISIS?!﻿
z125wtrwsmfmizfh404cidkbowbwhzxp3qs0k, 2015-11-24T01:59:08.141Z, Trump has been saying since the beginning of his presidential announcement.  And Carl Icahn made a whole 150M superpac himself preaching and warning  about companies leaving overseas. Corporate Inversion. Fox business folks  are the worst Rubio suckups. Disgusting. WSJ, Fox Business, and GOP  estabullies for that matter will pay for their bias reporting.﻿
z13wfdlg3ln4ztdon04cj1vztnnct1fy2zg0k, 2015-11-24T01:20:30.357Z, Rubio's establishment advisers provided him with a good plan for a  presentation to the public. But it still remains, that Rubio is too weak to  protect Americans from our own government, including special interests and  other government influence. He will quickly collapse when defending the  American public while in office. We have one chance to eliminate corruption and bring power to the people. TRUMP 2016... the man with the leverage and courage to Make America Great  Again!﻿
z13rtfihhuq3ixmyc04cfnbr3k34st3wlhg, 2015-11-24T01:04:50.087Z, Stupid republicans went back to sleep after 9/11 and didn't do a dammed  thing about Osama Bin Laden. Now they want to take credit for what they  didn't do. Neither Donald Trump nor Marco Rubio and Shithead Ted Cruz, who  is not even a native american have had the balls the put on the uniform and  fight for this country like thousands of latinos have. In fact one of the  first casualties during the stupid Bush Iraq war was a young marine from  Guatemala.﻿
z13xcftxdpirydgjr04ch1kytwe1znninfw, 2015-11-24T00:53:27.765Z, Cruz and Rubio are half rooted Americans now is not the time for another  half rooted president like Obama. we need some one that will standup and  take control of the govt. and turn America around!!...... Trump 2016!!!!!﻿

z13ufl1xtnbtdnz0g233ezupynbpjrpux, 2015-11-23T17:10:09.962Z, Rubio defeating hillary in a fox news poll the hillary campaign will not  lose one minute sleep﻿
z13uybao0wqceb30o221tzc5xubyxdcvt, 2015-11-23T17:02:51.904Z, Carson has said SO many things that fly past the edge of reality that  anyone with half a brain can see he's a full-on, flat-out nut job. I don't  agree with Lindsay Graham on policy - but he's given me no reason to  believe he's INSANE. Same with Bush, Kasich, Rubio, or Christie. (Cruz is  another head case.) What's so wrong with this country that perhaps millions  of people either can't see that Carson has fully slipped his mooring - or  are fine with a lunatic in the White House?﻿
z121hxfyimrojd3y304chrcrdsm4hpuohsw0k, 2015-11-23T15:23:41.341Z, Rubio blew it on his ISIS plan. Assad is not going anywhere. Putin and  France will destroy ISIS. Ignore Rubio and his nonsense!﻿
z135vlrq5uyrxn4vp22efzqaklyex5pd3, 2015-11-23T14:50:06.939Z, rubio...lol...only fox and GOP establishment push rubio...like romney, he  looses a lot of conservatives and will loose the election. We need a strong  conservative leader that leads and defends the nation, unlike rubio that  aligns with obama to bring illegals in by the millios﻿
z12kcn3ycqzkchmtp22hzn2qwrupddsqi04, 2015-11-23T11:35:29.082Z, Rubio is a one-trick pony. He can grasp foreign policy well, but he's weak  and disastrous on anything else. He'd be a good advisor to the president.  Rubio is no leader. The presidency is not a good fit for him.﻿
z12ncp0igm2ethbgc04citogfvihtvr5gnk0k, 2015-11-23T11:25:51.912Z, Rubio is a two-faced liar.  Changes his stance for votes.  Arming Sunnis is  a disaster.  Schmuck.﻿
z12he12hjonoefwm123pdhz4cyj1fljtg, 2015-11-23T11:13:54.364Z, knowing that Jeb is done, the establishment is desperately trying to push  Rubio on us.﻿
z13wvzbrslahffq2b22vzta5lyqbx3zl3, 2015-11-23T08:52:09.103Z, rubio is a pussy.﻿
z13ly3up2kruitoha04chd0y2zudvn25c5g, 2015-11-23T07:47:20.671Z, Rubio is running to get the nomination of the idiot party. This moron  doesn't realize that taking out Assad will create a power vacuum, just like  what happened in Iraq.﻿
z13ij5ni5nupgryst231j5yhetyfslcju04, 2015-11-23T07:35:49.998Z, Rubio is a noted liar with no experience, he cannot lead America.﻿
z12kjzbg2wevvbpoy04ccfmyoxbittjwpj4, 2015-11-23T05:15:20.126Z, Please , Please, O , Please For My Sake  !    Elect Marko Rubio !  He's a  Bigger Pussy Socialist Liar Than Obama !﻿
z13ejjyp3lunz1h4q04cepqauu3lddf4crs0k, 2015-11-23T04:52:47.241Z, Rubio and Bush are both punks.  Either of those shills are as bad as Hillary.﻿
z135ebzgbqetf1uxl04cflf5dqutwbvprpk0k, 2015-11-23T03:09:33.284Z, Marco Rubio would spend FUTURE US tax payers into oblivion. What would  adding a TRILLION dollars to the US military budget do to defeat ISIS? Give  me a break!﻿
z12cdn2ruubowlydo22zfjzoglmjyja0g, 2015-11-23T02:40:35.647Z, Who cares ,Rubio will not be president . he's only having a moment to shine  ,but in the end he will be chewed up . WATCH!﻿
z12bylwxkvrxu3skv23oet4qiyrszl52q, 2015-11-23T02:23:55.613Z, The only candidate who has spoken any sense in 6 months . Trump is a  salesman , Carson is short of knowledge and Cruz is a preacher . Rubio is  Reps best bet to Take HC down .﻿
z13afl1q4vjjh3xgs04cezi5qnzldlm5cx00k, 2015-11-23T01:37:00.307Z, trump vs. carson battle rubio vs. cruz battle and the rest suck lol﻿
z12dxd0wms3xe14cp22wxllo2quezbfbn04, 2015-11-23T01:25:47.100Z, Well we know fox likes Rubio, but he is much better than Kasich or Carson.  But I'm for TRUMP 2016!!﻿
z12ns1lpgt3hxxo0z22jhbvz3oeiyxfdw, 2015-11-23T01:23:26.302Z, Congratulations Rubio! Republicans FINALLY think you can beat the lying,  cheating, Hilary Clinton. Every single Republican voter should vote for a  Republican candidate beating Hilary, They didn't think Rubiio could beat a  criminal in the election. That is NOT good. Rubio just now gets Republican  approval to beat Hilary and he becomes an INSTANT success story?? Whaaaat?﻿
z12hvdshtxnjzkxkkybcv1pr5kusc5es1, 2015-11-23T00:27:12.848Z, Rubio, you're a lightweight. Get lost.﻿
z13yihkjszbkclfqj04cg12hipvihz1ogyo0k, 2015-11-22T23:22:25.695Z, Only 3 people have a shot at beating Clinton Trump, Carson and Rubio if history serves us right Americans like to chose exciting candidates not  boring or bland just take a look at the people that loss the presidential race﻿
z12mejnityfpffcee22yzpebjnmxcjehm04, 2015-11-22T22:50:20.156Z, C'mon Rubio , Russia is kicking Isis ass in Syria. They have done what the  US Hasn't done over 14 months. The US GOVERNMENT wants to eliminate Bashar  just for pipelines purposes the same way Hussein was eliminates because he  wasn't using the Petrodollar. Who are all of you candidates trying to fool.  Is a shame how fighting for our country has become a geopolitical issue and  having to fight for Corporate D.C it's all BS.﻿
z121znzbjxaxtzwcz23iwp1xnlabyhbyn04, 2015-11-22T22:44:02.251Z, Rubio will be brought down by the conservatives, like Jeb Bush.  🇺🇸TED CRUZ 2016!🇺🇸﻿
z12fwrpxozinub5tz22yzpebjnmxcjehm04, 2015-11-22T22:41:06.775Z, That's BS Rubio. The Kurds are the ones that have fought the most and want  to fight and need supply not Zuni. It'll be the same thing as b4 giving  thousands if ammo and supplies and then they turn back on us. NO NO NO !!!.  TRUMP 2016 !!!﻿
z130hdrawtukzvwsl23ucb15tovch5nuu, 2015-11-22T22:09:09.697Z, I thought Rubio said that he didn't pay much attention to polls--the  general tenor of his speech right now seems to tilt away from his  previously voiced views. Oh how evanescent are the ideas of these  politicians, all of them!﻿
z122chxhzuzzfpesg23cgbqj2kjwwvouz, 2015-11-22T21:55:15.233Z, Rubio talks a good talk but he still sounds like Obama . Rubio is a half  rooted American just like Obama . I think Rubio will be just like Obama in  larger govt., more debt, higher taxes and more job killing polices .﻿
z12ttfxatujbjppwc04cetmwotagwhlpucw, 2015-11-22T21:46:29.145Z, Fox news sucks. Trying to push Rubio. You wonder why people don't trust the  media. Total propaganda bullshit﻿

z122jnj45ojmcvtap04cddhpwzzqwbk4g3c, 2015-11-22T18:56:38.530Z, We have all been subject to government surveillance and travel checks and  restrictions because of this BS so why should certain Mosques suspected of  harboring and inciting terrorists be immune to scrutiny. Trump and Rubio  are right.﻿
z12dutq4wyj3vrw1l223u1wybtykj5tto, 2015-11-22T16:37:31.469Z, Trump/Cruz 2016﻿
z12qsldycprmcvxwk04cf5bohmfqfvn5sy40k, 2015-11-22T10:29:51.605Z, Seems reasonable for murderers. RINOs in Fox appear to be numerous and  corporate based. Clearly Rubio and Cruz are corporate puppets. I mean "My  parent was a Hispanic communist who worked hard because he loved this  country". Please.﻿
z12uclbidovisdxo504ccrbyfoarhbkh1jw, 2015-11-22T03:42:39.151Z, Trump's lead mainly increased because more voters went from Carson to Rubio  and Cruz. So ultimatly Trumps way to winnin the nomination will depend on  how many that drops out. Although I think it is unlikely that any of his top 3 competitors will drop  out since they all have very similar numbers so therefore it is very likely  that he will win. The wildcard is that there is still around 20% to be had  from the remaining candidates though.﻿
z12ohrchzte5g3h4204cij0pruuofvxznw40k, 2015-11-22T01:24:55.214Z, Hey wheres the Republican idiot congressman to yell out "you lie". Trump  and Carson in the early poll leads is nothing but a rouse on the behalf of  the Repuglicans. Everyone knows these two candidate are polarizing and  garner all the headlines, which allow the real candidates to maneuver very  quietly. You have to be some kind of idiot to vote for Carson or Trump.  Again we are talking about Republicans. Cruz, Bush or Rubio and not Fat boy  in little coat Christie﻿
z12zcxbrskf3jtdxt04cfpwgrxvmiveyslc0k, 2015-11-21T20:44:25.193Z, Look at Hildabeast Clinton pretending to give a shit about black people.  JEB and Marco Rubio should fuck off.﻿
z13ytb5jeofyx3k2w23djpzqgtjwcbz1z, 2015-11-21T17:13:16.323Z, I am not religious, but I like Carson. He is absolutely right, settle them  in their part of the world. We have to accept we live in an open society  and cannot risk a leak in the backround checks that we cannot trust to be  accurate. 1 terrorist could means hundreds of lives...I would really like  to see Carson/Rubio.﻿
z13zf5dxzvyqijsw504cjzuokpqshhwyhus0k, 2015-11-21T04:13:30.502Z, Senator Rubio , Obama is the Muslim - in - Chief !!! And Obama and Hillary  HATE America !!!﻿

z134ijnyvt3qtjto204cdbkpgm2eybphpx40k, 2015-11-19T20:29:03.207Z, RUBIO - how does he make a mistake and use the government credit card to  pay for wine? This congresswoman is so blind by good looks.

z12lyhbokuuij1hjb04cdrcqutnzepmr3kg0k, 2015-11-17T02:27:35.979Z, Brace yourselves Republicans! If Carson's mind-blowing stupidity makes its  way through your national convention, you may want to kiss your  Congressional majorities goodbye! Seriously, if you're going to nominate  someone, nominate someone with a brain, like Rubio or Bush....maybe Kasich.  Even Ted Cruz is pretty brilliant.﻿

z123g1f4hpnjyxrth23tuhz5evytf5emy, 2015-11-16T00:44:41.598Z, Kasich is awesome. He's reasonable on social issues, and to the right on  foreign policy. That's exactly where you want to be in the general  election. However, to win the nomination, you either need to be far right  or you need to be really well known. He's neither. If he ran in 2012, he  would probably be the favorite to win the nomination now.﻿

z13ndvkx3wqzundjl04cct3w1r3dz5pif2g, 2015-11-15T20:26:47.965Z, Well, I  call it the way I see it, it looks like Rubio has more  intelligence than trump and Obama put together. Whoever says other wise  needs to pay more attention and  understand what they are saying and why  they are saying it. Donald trump thinks everybody is stopped and don't   know  what they  are saying, he thinks he  is the only smart person, he  calls everybody else stopped and so on.﻿
z13rv1xpiprzsbiqd04ci3dxxunejjk4yiw, 2015-11-15T19:57:49.829Z, Rubio knocks it out the park as usual; clear, concise and articulate points  on understanding the psychology tactics of isis, its absolutely true that  the more they grow, the more people they attract to their cause from all  around the world. We need to wipe them off the face of the earth and show  the world we're a force to be reckoned with. And yes with a humiliating  defeat.﻿
z12lxti53ymkz54lh22widdhlpe1hpvue, 2015-11-15T19:18:18.689Z, In the final minute Rand talks about arming our enemies leading to the rise  of Isis. Folks like Rubio supported the arming and now wants to fight those  that now have our weapons. Funny how Friedrick Hayek describe the Marco  Rubio's of the world in his book the Road to Serfdom. The government  creates a problem and is now saying they are going to fix the problem that  they created if you elect me.   Are we the dumbest country in the world by rewarding these people with  power?﻿
z12khfnyjmvoibfpr04ch1kytwe1znninfw, 2015-11-15T18:47:21.366Z, Rubio looks like he could play the part of the Joker just add a little  green paint lol!!! you think Obama is bad just vote for Rubio or bush then  the jokes on you. TRUMP 2016!!!!!!﻿

z12nehdijmeksphyq04cd53r2r35xpswsvs0k, 2015-11-15T07:45:52.782Z, I'm amazed by Senator Rubio s analysis on the psychology of ISIS. He is  absolutely right! . They think they are unstoppable and the US needs to  publicly humiliate them in an all out war. I know Truman and Churchill  wouldn't be sitting around being politically correct about this. They would  have attacked.﻿
z13iuviiatvgcrbwt04cg32pfzbtwhghbh0, 2015-11-15T06:14:41.135Z, Well said Mr Rubio. We must hold our anger in check. Request volunteers for  spec ops teams to hit ISIS and sabotage their oil supplies. That means  hitting their economics and stop all trade going into and out of ISIS  territory.﻿
z13sit3gfvexypbcj221gx5xxsetyxu4004, 2015-11-15T04:39:15.758Z, Rubio can't even get a bill passed in the Senate. He can barely do the job  he has, all he does is run his mouth. Voters in Florida are pissed off he barely shows up for work but collects 100% paycheck, mainly  freeloading off the citizens of Florida. Promised them the same thing he is  promising all of America now. Rubio is a two bit hustler.﻿

z12pydezitbczlmxr04cdjfyvxzdzljorhs, 2015-11-14T20:08:06.315Z, Western liberals and leftists can't get enough of islam and muslims, and  that's the price we have to pay. How many thousands of innocent people will  have to die before the cowardly leftist traitors will open their eyes and  see islam for what it is? It's not just "ISIS propaganda", it's islamic  propaganda that we should worry about.﻿

z12bsvqa3zyxs5qxp04ce3fqttfzfpdgs2o, 2015-11-14T18:48:55.863Z, This is precisely what Senator Rubio has been talking about.  The only way  to help in stemming the tide of Islamist extremist is to have Muslims  combat them on and off the battle field.﻿
z12uyfyhexqmsp3vz22scnea1oiuuzaus, 2015-11-14T17:46:03.044Z, Putin is genius politician and if you Rubio think that he is a gangster and  even call it reality then you are delusional.

z13uvbx5cmjax1zzz04cinbpmva0y1yre0w, 2015-11-14T05:40:55.965Z, I think Rubio is stupid for being a tow-the-line global warming denier, but  he could make a decent President on complex issues like this. He's a heck  of a lot more refined than clowns like Trump and Carson.﻿
z13bfnb5csnrhbnwg04ccvua3p33slybndw, 2015-11-14T03:24:30.893Z, I really like Rubio, his military build up is a good policy to stay ahead  of China. But I hope it's NOT used in Syria. We already re-built Iraq and  spend trillions and many lives. It's time to let Russia waste their  resources, as we watch from the sidelines.﻿

z12zeripknzfgnjgf04cgnzbqmrnhxgjvms0k, 2015-11-13T17:15:06.583Z, Rand Paul is right about Rubio being liberal. Rubio said his plan was a  refund for people with children, so when you don't have kids you have to  pay for others who do. Sounds like welfare. 1 trillion more in military  spending isn't conservative and it's unnecessary.﻿

Rubio was  the biggest joke on stage and should not be in the Republican party. Rubio  being such a commie globalist douchebag makes Carson look far better than  he performed. Rubio and Chris Christie need to be kicked out of the party  altogether. They are a complete joke.﻿

z13rtzpghqzis1bgv04cjbdadmibepd54oo0k, 2015-11-13T15:48:20.256Z, Let's check all politicians emails and lets drug test them .﻿
z13yjx5okzeruxwaz04cjbdadmibepd54oo0k, 2015-11-13T15:24:27.104Z, Fuck Rubio and Cruz . Cubans have amnesty to come to this country . And  they turn around and shit on other Hispanics.﻿
z13agrk5xo3mdd2qp04cg54jzna4vt4x1l40k, 2015-11-13T15:20:03.006Z, I guess that bitch rubio started to drop some money. He still don't  understand most of americans don't want him to be the next president...  He'll be fighting against cuba and latin american countries's governments  instead of taking care of the us. Damn! I hate him so much! I mean...I  strongly dislike him.﻿
z13dvtdbduywhz4yg04cfjubyumqir44f1g, 2015-11-13T11:21:38.630Z, What a moron! Anybody really wants him to become US president. U should  realize this mtfckr can lead all the world to 3-rd WW! Fuck U, Rubio!﻿
z12jxpubtliih1y1h22mczfbbuyztjzj204, 2015-11-13T04:32:02.604Z, I'm already sick of Rubio's phoney too-toothy smile ... he reminds me of  Hillary, less the pant suit﻿
z13diphivwqhdvgur22mczfbbuyztjzj204, 2015-11-13T04:30:54.352Z, Rubio is a poser... just another RINO GOP shill - basically Hillary without  the pant suit﻿
z12uebkqcxjjurars04cijpiimvwepfhol40k, 2015-11-13T04:05:21.755Z, rubio is too robotic with text book answers...bullshit﻿
z13vhjkx5yy3xveas04cfborauf2jjoj3nk0k, 2015-11-13T00:32:59.581Z, Looks like Fox News had some Rubio plants in the crowd﻿
z13idrpwamz4h122422tx5tqmsnvx3sww04, 2015-11-13T00:10:12.126Z, There are two wings of the party, one is Rubio, Bush, Christie, and other  neocon RINOs. They are big spenders in office, just like George W. Bush was  and his father. The other wing is true conservatives like Rand Paul, Justin  Amash, Ted Cruz, and many others. Victory for Rubios wing means another 8  years of Bush style big spending, big bailouts, big war corporatism, and  big surveillance state.﻿
z13yxnbhjsvoerin022tx5tqmsnvx3sww04, 2015-11-12T23:38:07.972Z, Rand Paul made it crystal clear to the audience that Rubio is not a true  conservative, Rubio is an establishment neocon rino.﻿
z125hdtzvwbnw5i0r22efdghqlvrfzsv4, 2015-11-12T16:59:23.883Z, Like Obama Rubio has the style to talk and debate in a clever likable way.  Like Obama Rubio has no track records to speak of and no experiences. So  like Obama he would be a very incompetent President. So why reject Obama if  you are going to replace him with an over rated young Rubio?﻿
z13xcluxzmytefieo22efdghqlvrfzsv4, 2015-11-12T16:27:01.661Z, Rubio like Obama has the style to talk in debate but really nothing else.  Like Obama the young Rubio has no track records to speak of and very little  experiences. Like Obama Rubio would be very incompetent as President. Trump  with Ben Carson as running mate would be awesome and will definitely make  America Great Again!﻿
z12kche4epmyeruwf04cjzuokpqshhwyhus0k, 2015-11-12T10:00:39.402Z, Trump for the victory !!! If the Republicans Establishment broker's the  Republican Convention to put BUSH OR RUBIO AS THE CANDIDATE TO FACE HILLARY  , they will lose to her !!! AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY !!!﻿
z13dwft53nefxf1eh225u1uysxagx5d1o, 2015-11-12T07:36:44.581Z, Agree, you can like him or not, but Marco Rubio is so far the only  candidate to got a chance against Hillary.﻿

Rubio is your guy with his  knowledge in national security and foreign policies! he's your man not the  guy that blames china for everything when china wasn't even part of the  deal! 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂﻿
z12yc3gqilizuzol523kdjo5ryusyfyzx04, 2015-11-12T04:49:49.079Z, Marco Rubio is just a fear mongering neocon. Rand Paul won this exchange.  HANDS DOWN! Rubio falsely called Rand an isolationist. Rand has called for  a declaration of war on ISIS. In addition, unlike Marco, Rand doesn't want  to arm those who burn down are flag. How can we ever expect to defeat  radical Islam if we keep arming terrorists? #StandWithRand﻿

z13ehj0hvwadeztbm04cjpeh3nfvijpx24w, 2015-11-11T21:52:22.016Z, Nothing about Rand Paul, even when going through all of the candidates at  the end? Shocked. O'Reilly is a big spending neocon warhawk just like Rove  and Rubio and Cruz and everyone else up there except Rand, the only true  conservative.﻿
z12jsrmycmaxuxygy04cihz5zxazw3th25k, 2015-11-11T21:31:25.091Z, Rubio claims to want a "New American Century" while simultaneously  supporting all the failed big government policies of the past century.﻿

z13mtv0xzwelyvgle23wyn5qxsmixnoiy04, 2015-11-11T17:33:00.722Z, Rubio, the DOD is "fully funded" up to it's eyeballs. If the DOD needs more  money (which I doubt), they need to look inward and start cutting the fat  in that agency. I'm sure there's plenty of it.﻿
z12wyfbg5uybjlvwd04cfvl5ave5htshqqs0k, 2015-11-11T16:30:24.317Z, Trump a man with a vision on a mission,  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,  GO  TRUMP GO,  GOD SPEED DONALD TRUMP,  A MAN WITH A PLAN.  Rubio is trying to  bluff us,  Bush is just a piece of crap, nobody wants to hear what he has  to say, as for the rest they could shine Mr. Trump's shoes, but I don't  think he would pay them very much.﻿
z12hep5ieqz0wxj2s22wefracvvhshcbe04, 2015-11-11T16:26:54.237Z, How much did Rubio's backers "donate" to you Fox News to run this  propaganda trash?

z131h3gylyu2ufanh22zyxb45yj5dfctj, 2015-11-11T13:48:58.233Z, Wow some airtime for Paul. When he speaks there is an adult conversation.  Rubio is a Neo-con, but still he needs to explain why he would be strong  against Isis.﻿

Rubio deflecting  in the way that he does and pivoting into political talking points shows  what a snake this guy is. He's very polished and quick on his feet, but the  guy is all talk.﻿
z12bihuq2tu5i5hfk23wwxfxlszjjjhf2, 2015-11-10T04:57:16.227Z, Trump did not file 4 BK's. That was 4 different companies that filed BK  which Trump used the BK laws to his advantage and made those companies  better. And you can't compare a business to your personal finances. That is  a distraction by comparing apples to oranges in an attempt to take the  attention off yourself.﻿

The other half is going  to be wasted discussing Rubio's credit cards. It's going to be a bigger  waste of time than the CNN debate.  The "kiddy table" debate will no doubt  be much more informative.﻿
z13hh3gyxmrggtyka23mg1xb1z3jzhcxq04, 2015-11-09T18:58:06.099Z, Rubio has been disloyal to Jeb, Rubio has been a disaster in usage of his  credit card, Rubio has the backing of billionaires whom he addresses as  masters. Above all Rubio is going to have WW3 over Syria. This man's thirst  for power is pure personal. MONEY. For that he is willing to sell out his  principles, his party, and his country.﻿

z12zcx4ibxirzte1f22pjhdbxo3ozxca204, 2015-11-07T13:15:00.811Z, Rubio - you are as false as a two bob watch . . .﻿
z12kflbpvwn3w1zdi23zyp45hq3fjbniq04, 2015-11-07T09:14:52.467Z, POMPEO ARE YOU SERIOUS . RUBIO IS BROKE !!! USED HIS FLORIDA SPEAKER OF THE  HOUSE CREDIT CARD FOR $ 109,000.00 ON HIS PERSONAL EXPENSES !!! HOW MANY  SENATE VOTES HAS RUBIO MISSED SINCE HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ?﻿
z13jfl4qqtjcej1bp04cirubgwejcrmxehc, 2015-11-07T08:58:20.381Z, Marco Rubio is Sheldon Adelson's new Bitch Puppet. don't trust a man who  stands at National Debate denouncing money in politics doesn't exist. That  says it All.﻿
z12dhh45zri0cl40s22jvbfpqwvmcdadh, 2015-11-07T04:52:26.551Z, Trump is trash and a traitor. He was a friend with him last week talking  nice things about him and now he want to you use these lies to destroy him.  This is only going to help Carson . Dr. Carson for president﻿
z12ds3lheo3mhnvl4222vl44azagurklt, 2015-11-07T04:30:14.927Z, Carson confesses his failings as a young person, and why is this wrong?  People can't make up their minds. They don't like him because he supposedly  was less than honest about Westpoint (emphasis on "supposedly"). They don't  like him because of his honesty about his flaws. This is nuts.﻿
z12hgr4bjkmocttn022nz3m4pqeutljom04, 2015-11-07T02:08:40.916Z, Rubio, time to pack it up﻿
z13vyj4wupn0c124h04cizga1niwgnxqdp00k, 2015-11-07T01:36:53.331Z, hahahaha Good Guy Rubio ((insert text meme here)) refuses to throw that  stone lol﻿

z12ohxiock3nzxink22zhryyjnuyz1jif04, 2015-11-06T22:30:28.116Z, I'm so angry this great candidate is getting shoved off so much and is  being ignored by the media. Leftist controlled media wants to put Donald  Trump in the spotlight to shine his stupidity as representing the  republican party, to turn people away and vote left. This hushes great  candidates like Rubio who deserve the spotlight more than some idiot like  Trump. It's just another way the leftist media is cheating the entire race,  just like they did with Ron Paul in 2012.﻿
z13jjbu4zvy0ybylc23ldxraywzet3sa304, 2015-11-06T22:28:35.439Z, Looks like Jeb is being dump by the establishment for Rubio.﻿
z13chduhpuawfx2or04cc5bznufthltqkfg, 2015-11-06T21:44:43.336Z, What has Marco Rubio ever actually done?﻿
z13fgr341xz4sfkxi04cfborauf2jjoj3nk0k, 2015-11-06T21:34:04.991Z, Fox news is shooting Ben Carson over this ridiculous controversy? Oh  please. The media have to dig really hard to find anything on Ben Carson.  This is nothing but a hit job by the liberal media.﻿
z132d3qzvt2jwpkzm04cgxvxbnqnsdnboqc0k, 2015-11-06T21:24:56.654Z, Here is a difference between conservatives and "progressives":  If Carson  lied about West Point, we WANT to know, not to cover it up.Wacky libs look  ideology first, truth second.﻿
z13ldjqa5zj5hfnnt22fd1jj1v2auvy31, 2015-11-06T18:37:33.446Z, marco rubio is a robot ahhhh run away!!!!!!!﻿
z13wv1cw3vuegxkb304cjhxowvuow1aasv40k, 2015-11-06T18:25:07.899Z, He is a liar though. Yes others have lied, but Carson is no different. This  guy can't even give a straight answer to policy questions.﻿
z13ttnnppnnjujjbz04cclwg4w2ne5pqsuk0k, 2015-11-06T16:50:21.236Z, Best anti-Rubio commercial ever﻿
z13lsnah2pr3h5gao04cc5fo4kuruhvxbls0k, 2015-11-06T15:59:23.938Z, Media trying so hard to make Rubio important. Doesn't he have like 70% less  of the votes in polls than the leaders? Just shows u this shit is fucked.  How many times did they say the word 'surge?' 3rd place is not a surge.  FUCK MEDIA.﻿
z13thrgwwvilsrvym04ci3dxxunejjk4yiw, 2015-11-06T11:40:14.707Z, As long as Rubio's safe, I don't care. And maybe Cruz too.﻿
z13bcrbgjwnhursgx04ccnpbymjuvflps20, 2015-11-06T10:48:40.392Z, Still looking for a mentally sane Republican candidate for presidency ?  Somehow i think we need to understand that such a thing does not exist  anymore ;)﻿
z12yhngoaweydzemb224jlebzwjvzpvpg04, 2015-11-06T09:30:31.939Z, BEN CARSON 2016﻿

z12pixxgvtiof5ajb04cgx5xcyywxxairyk0k, 2015-11-06T01:00:30.627Z, Marco Rubio is Co-Sponsor of the bill to replace American workers with  foreign workers in India. The I-Squared bill of 2015 if passed, would  triple the number of H-1B visas used to send US jobs to India. The question  is who is paying him to do this?﻿
z12wj5bh3rz1s552l23vwpcwdmziurvyw04, 2015-11-06T00:53:20.232Z, I believe rubio like I believe his hair line. #combover﻿
z13ec5nzhmnqvzlhl04cctzijz3lgnbap4o, 2015-11-06T00:53:04.992Z, I am Polish American. I will say dr. Carson has no idea what he is talking  about. Only Donald Trump knows how to do internationals deals and  communicate with current world leaders. Marco Rubio is a kid. Bush is low  energy person. H. Clinton has no idea as dr. Carson.﻿
z12wgpejirqogrl2w222iliwfpvddlnjb04, 2015-11-05T22:17:35.477Z, As for Rubio being young, having money mismanagement, and being pro  amnesty/immigration...I will not vote for him.﻿
z131i3ypbuyrshnvv22duhfrgniijl45l04, 2015-11-05T22:14:30.892Z, Fuck trump. Bitch ass born rich pig. Rubio and carson came from nothing and  are self made men.trump probably never learned how to tie his own shoe.﻿

z12ysrazouv1v3k5004chxu4mraphzxpet00k, 2015-11-05T19:39:53.957Z, Marco Rubio is self made﻿
z13yyv0zpwfae3evj23uf5t5zsywwt4tk, 2015-11-05T05:08:27.875Z, Good answers on BLM by Rubio. He puts himself out there as intelligent,  understanding and looks presidential. Very well could end up being the  nominee﻿
z13gcrabxv3pulz5b04cdb2ypznutv2igt40k, 2015-11-05T04:58:17.525Z, what a difference a debate can make.... Rubio will be the nominated....  good bye entitled Bush.... Bush family... never thought they will have so  many competitors...﻿

z131g33a5svudzrhj04cgtbg0nezir2ybn00k, 2015-11-05T03:58:07.673Z, I dont have any authority whatsoever.... what I can see is that, Trump  attacked or counter attacked almost every candidate except Carson so far,  which might be the reason why Carson has the chance to leapfrogged trump  well beside the ad campaign that kicked in for carson recently.  Look at Fiorina, Bush, and others.... The only 3 that surged were cruz,  carson and rubio, and 2 out of the 3 weren't attacked by Trump until a few  days ago. that might means something....﻿
z13oyhawppj3wbbxc04cdbdpixmhtty4kq40k, 2015-11-05T01:40:02.477Z, You can tell Trumptard and all his supporters are scared of Rubio lol.  That's why they gotta keep bashing, while the younger Rubio is being the  bigger man.﻿
z12sybhoklndthtge04cgx5xcyywxxairyk0k, 2015-11-04T23:48:51.533Z, If Marco Rubio wants to increase the number of H-1B visas because he thinks  Americans do not have the skills, then why are Americans required to train  their replacements?﻿
z13vx5qbksy4udjtm23bdjebrrbjdnpzo04, 2015-11-04T23:44:17.120Z, Marco Rubio is a co-sponsor of the outsourcing "I Squared" bill that would  triple the number of H-1B visas used to send American jobs to India.﻿

z13ozrtidsnotzfwt04cfpbwsn23jxhbwkc0k, 2015-11-04T19:39:14.957Z, Rubio is a corporations sellout. The perfect puppet aka president of US.  VOTE 4 Rubio!﻿
z130gf5apsnoib1yv04cfdug2rrcdpfoins0k, 2015-11-04T19:05:28.703Z, Just give up and ask your supporters to support Marco Rubio, he's pretty  much a 40 years old latino version of you anyway.﻿
z12uxj5xhsmpy55mf23ysv4h5mruzta4c04, 2015-11-04T18:15:17.492Z, Fuck this Cuban NeoCon Trotskyite garbage pail. He wants the Project for a  New American Century. The only candidate who would be worse than this sissy  is another sissy named Lindsey Graham. I happen to find gay Lindsey's  personality less annoying than this piece of trash Rubio's though.﻿
z130gx5qmtepvx2eb23ysv4h5mruzta4c04, 2015-11-04T18:13:34.356Z, Marco Rubio is trash. The only candidate who would be worse than him is  Lindsey Graham..........and I have to say I find gay Lindsey's personality  less annoying.﻿

z13oy5dpsq2vu5apq04ccds44tyhftyzfcw, 2015-11-04T15:31:09.549Z, Marc Rubio is bright but lacks experience to be president.﻿
z12xtjkhytens1s1i231ivmitk3ugzgnp, 2015-11-04T06:28:25.808Z, Rubio will never get the Repub base to vote for him when he is pushing OPEN  BORDERS - Give me a break. This is the Repubs OBAMA!!!﻿
z13yw5phftjfermsf22xhrlanlrvz3rke, 2015-11-04T05:23:32.617Z, Super pacs and Media try to destroy Trump. It will be very hard but if they  succeed, do you know who will be next ? Carson. And that will be much  easier. When they're done with Carson, they put their establishment puppet  like Rubio. So let's do everything possible not to let it happen. Keep the  good work ladies and gentlemen!!!﻿

z13suxw5vuefdhgoo04cdfhxxmm0f3ox2j4, 2015-11-03T21:21:38.441Z, I think Rubio is the most electable GOP candidate. He would destroy Hillary  in the general election.﻿
z135yplx5orpeludc22evjjgok2sxbcnt, 2015-11-03T21:18:52.863Z, I'm surprised that Rubio actually managed to twist her question into a  reasonable answer.﻿

z12hezny1uzvchvlm23yv5rqaxrrj5efn, 2015-11-03T15:50:49.158Z, Steve Hayes is right about Rubio. I am still perplexed when I hear Marco  described as the Establishment figure, when he is a bonafide movement  Conservative.﻿
z12qwbfailmzyz0aa04cddjysu2btfoqp4g, 2015-11-03T15:31:25.914Z, fox has and is always unfair to Cruz. It is obvious that the morning show  pushes trump and the rest of the day pushes a moderate (rubio or bush but  now mostly rubio). for some reason fox has been becoming left and is  contempt with a moderate which is no better than a liberal. Fox is NOT fair  nor balanced﻿

z120tr1p0yq1zjz0n224t3prklzhjfcl0, 2015-11-03T05:05:38.313Z, Please Lord tell me these people are not the future of our party.  Supporting Jeb, saying Trump is the most qualified. I do see some hope with  the chick that said Cruz. More people than Rubio can beat Killary. We need  a conservative not someone who plays one on T.V. please listen closely to  what candidate say.﻿
z12wilpbvzbnzb2wk04cibrqktjfibuwuh4, 2015-11-03T04:33:54.968Z, They were cranking the heater during the fox debate that's why Rubio was  drenched and pounding water. Trump never took a sip, he probably can't  trust their water.﻿

z12vjjexqzyltbbgr04cijpj4qnlvfabaak, 2015-11-03T02:08:10.149Z, Rubio just comes across to me like your typical blue sport coat Republican.  The status quo. He want's to get elected so that he can be "President". Not  so that he can help America. All of his responses are so "prepared", as if  he has been coached over and over on how to respond to questions. To me he  would just be another Bush term.﻿

z12pw1zguxfjwjzew22pv3ah0prqzhbvt, 2015-11-02T18:33:05.179Z, Rubio has no stats as a player. He's .000 and he is deep in the pockets of  the establishment RNC leadership. Bottom line, Rubio is just another RINO.  When will the GOP finally see that the base is fed up with candidates that  won't shut the border, won't stop the spending and won't repeal obamacare.  ENOUGH...away with you!﻿

z13cfjchkziculh2p22lz5gwosbzgf00l, 2015-11-01T07:20:12.013Z, Rubio is jackass.﻿
z13shr2yarvkujxm022wxllo2quezbfbn04, 2015-11-01T06:39:23.771Z, TRUMP 2016!!! We don't need another bought candidate like Rubio. If Rubio  got rid of his super pacs and lobbyists that would be the only way I'm  voting for him.﻿
z13wtp1gorm1czzsi22sijvjvwyqevzhv04, 2015-11-01T05:34:56.344Z, Any combination of Trump/Carson/Cruz/Rubio is fine by me.﻿
z13xejbjzmnlxf40323eer1ycwz5dtxal04, 2015-11-01T03:45:13.341Z, They include the roaring applause line from Rubio & Christie but not Cruz  who had the loudest applause of the night and poll tested the highest,  almost wonder if Fox is hoping for a loser establishment candidate﻿
z13yjnvjoomauhaxi04chtri4rvycryzkq40k, 2015-11-01T02:41:15.934Z, Marco Rubio is a joke.﻿

z130f345bkj0t5dgg04cfborauf2jjoj3nk0k, 2015-10-31T20:11:01.326Z, Fox news keeps trying to prop up the establishment candidates, Jeb Bush,  Marco Rubio, it's a bunch of crap. We don't want anymore neocons.﻿
z130vvk4ini2jxwsx23pg1abyqatg1frh04, 2015-10-31T19:15:13.411Z, Oh, yea...the "experienced politicians" have done their jobs  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo well the past two or three  decades. Yea, we all want more of that. That's what we're really looking  for.   Who are these bozos?﻿
z13dwjtaywvtgfu2o23cdxzrguiktzbtn, 2015-10-31T17:55:27.313Z, You mean the final 3, Trump, Carson, Fiorina. These are the only people we  are interested in. They have never held an elected office. The rest of them  are participants in betrayal except maybe Cruz and Paul. Cruz maybe for  Attorney General. Paul for IRS secretary. The rest of the lot should get  out, especially Rubio, Jeb, and "Fat Boy". Not to mention that habitual  liar who all Marines Hate, Hillary.﻿
z13rzzkimvfhen1ta23cdxzrguiktzbtn, 2015-10-31T17:48:27.648Z, We Told you Fat Boy, We do not want our Troops in Syria. We are tired of  "He is killing his own people" Excuse. We are sick of that same old line.  You will never be President. We do not want anyone that has ever held  office to be President.. Pass the message to Jeb, Rubio, and the rest of  the of Status Quo crew. Oh yeah, That includes that habitual liar Hillary.﻿
z12oy5aq5yyei5qgu04cfbuj2krkfpi4yy40k, 2015-10-31T17:46:11.586Z, WHAT RUBIO IS SAYING ,,IF OTHERS DON'T SHOW UP FOR WORK ,,WHY SHOULD HE﻿
z13ad55q5sbvx3hir04cgftjcprbvxeixfs, 2015-10-31T16:27:47.754Z, Carson has a messianic complex, is obviously enamoured with himself, and  thinks he is God's gift to the world. I can and will do without him and  vote for Rubio, the only REALLY qualified GOP candidate offering real  solutions to the nations problems with a proven record.﻿
z120edezhkyvepiks23ksz2y3mjcvhvsu, 2015-10-31T16:27:27.436Z, ... bullsh¡t, Rubio was MENTORED by John Ellis Bush. Really phoney b.s. And now little Rubio has the taint of having a vulture hedge fund manager  BILLIONAIRE supporter.﻿
z132ttwxhyipix5wj04ccfwa4knkcfbzlec, 2015-10-31T16:08:05.972Z, Christie and Fiorina have absolutely no chance at all of winning, and they  should be dropped... Their numbers continue to drop... The Top 4 should be  the only ones left in the debates...﻿
z132vxowkqjyftyje04cer04lumyyvqovb4, 2015-10-31T16:02:20.930Z, Rubio is a good guy.﻿
z125fv1o3qq2g31ru04cer04lumyyvqovb4, 2015-10-31T15:59:27.556Z, I support Rubio.﻿
z13ru1campzxwp13s23idxohmkb2u3ihi04, 2015-10-31T15:30:42.871Z, How can rubio manage the country's finances when he cant even manage his  own. there is a reason why the romney team did not pick him. the guy is a  crook imo﻿
z120ytbjwre5z1am422sc14jgpf2v1jo404, 2015-10-31T14:46:58.466Z, Mark Rubio's father was a Barman. His mother was a maid.﻿
z131ghlhmlj5xf2oo04ccdm5oxnfflfg1l40k, 2015-10-31T09:46:26.598Z, Marco Rubio knows the regular American struggles of our generation, period﻿
z12kspf5zwm0tv4gm04cg1uzbuz1tdsgxvc0k, 2015-10-31T08:03:02.366Z, Megyn Kelly, the perfect woman: smart, tough and beautiful. If she were  running, I'd vote for her. But, Rubio is damned smart and prepared and is  the best hope to stop "The Bitch": aka Hillary﻿
z13ytxwwoqrrj3pp204cij1itmihh1j4bp00k, 2015-10-31T04:47:38.837Z, It was obvious Rubio and Cruz and Christie won this debate. Carson and  Trump were right in the middle of the pack. Carson and Trump will remain at  the top. But i predict the next poll with have Carson, Trump Rubio Cruz at  the top 4﻿
z12itpph4wuifddzh04chd0y2zudvn25c5g, 2015-10-31T04:44:19.004Z, Kasich is one of the few potty trained Republican left. The entire party  has gone full retard.﻿
z13jczjzer3mh314t04cg3fpezqctl55yjk, 2015-10-31T00:43:38.110Z, Donald Trump is a joke I actually like Jeb Bush but would never vote for him because of his  brother. Rubio seems like he's all talk. Slimy politician.  Huckabee is a joke lol Kinda like Carson Cruz is cool but too right wing﻿
z12edljgwve5wh3xs04cj10jtnixfdfzcis, 2015-10-30T22:30:47.189Z, Anyone know who's having a sale on Quentin Tarantino movie DVD's ? Maybe  some of you murderin' pigs want to sell *your* DVD's, huh ?. You'll need  the money to pay for your homicide defense once Trump or Rubio gets sworn  in. I'll pay 5 cents per DVD set, if they're in *perfect* condition. *NO  pits* *NO scratches*. Fingerprints are welcome. I'll send those to the  Anonymous Crime Lab and we'll investigate your ass. You pay shipping.﻿
z12chzdhavyyyts5j04cjl0qwzf3s3frckk0k, 2015-10-30T22:17:11.983Z, Fox News is fucking DESPERATE for Marco Rubio to become the front-runner.﻿
z132vzphyzrpjv3m223ng3wjztzawz4ly, 2015-10-30T21:50:20.821Z, Rubio has hardly any track record which is why him missing so many votes is  problematic. You can't compare McCain and Rubio in this respect. I fear  Rubio is all talk just like Obama. I'd rather have someone with experience.﻿
z13edrfj5lzwttwjb04cezwgztnii5qqtas, 2015-10-30T21:12:56.980Z, Champion of political correctness Ben Carson wants the debate moderators to  be politically correct and not challenge him﻿
z13ahrjrhmzuhhulm23jzxzgdkuhi31iw04, 2015-10-30T18:51:05.209Z, Fuck Harry Reid﻿
z12fx5khsxupxrfmg23chzbyaojyvbfsk, 2015-10-30T17:18:49.058Z, Rubio mopped the floor with him.﻿
z13ehrvjhsu2jdu1y23zfp3hguyvyvxh404, 2015-10-30T12:40:42.898Z, Jeb Bush stinks of desperation. His weakness on illegal immigration makes  him an extremely unappealing candidate. Can't wait till he drops out so his  points can go to other republicans.﻿
z13xshnz5sahy53pa04celrgbpjcxxhbii0, 2015-10-30T05:58:06.200Z, The only talking heads whining about the CNN moderators or their ?s are the racist, sexist, homophobic Republi -cans & their ilk. IMO the moderators were razor sharp & fact checked those blow hards around every turn. The 'debate' was awesome, but now I bet the next one will be stacked with right wing types & will be a total snooze fest, every one of these Republic bafoons getting on their soap boxes to run out the two hours st8 into an old re-run of "The Golden Girls."﻿
z12fhl44cp2bgv32z23lxxoafuvlyrand, 2015-10-30T05:53:28.383Z, Rubio needs to show up to work and learn to pay his mortgage before he can  be president.﻿
z12cifoxrr3iizkl222fctvjmsq3vbxnh, 2015-10-30T05:45:05.439Z, Rubio just sounds like another politician.﻿
z12tzldwotvohnma304cdtcarozyuxvbgsw0k, 2015-10-30T05:14:55.631Z, Ted Cruz is full of shit﻿
z13yvpnbbmastfnqt04cjhxowvuow1aasv40k, 2015-10-30T05:13:44.215Z, Kasich is the best candidate on the right and his party is too stupid to  realize it. Vote Trump, you morons.﻿
z12lgxgzcojtinbdc23zwjzodtfpjxqqi04, 2015-10-30T05:00:29.197Z, the questions thrown were a mix of subtle insults and misread numbers and  statements. Harwood and Quick are a disgrace to their profession. Harwood  on misreading or lying on Rubio"s tax plan and Quick on misreading the  phrase on Trump's website on the HBVisas. These people are disgusting!!!!﻿
z12jthbr3wqaw3eyf04cdbdpixmhtty4kq40k, 2015-10-30T04:33:59.839Z, Many white people will never want to see a latino like Rubio win, even  though he's the best. so they side with trump/ hitler ﻿
z12xvjyzmxbssfhlb23cgbqj2kjwwvouz, 2015-10-30T04:08:25.988Z, this is a false a attack setting up the mainstream to boost THERE polls  numbers. bush will pick Rubio as his vp. bush is pulling a TRUMP...Trump  2016!!!﻿
z13ifzsrnry0dpbb004cdtvbimivz5kiafc, 2015-10-30T03:42:21.017Z, Trump was just laying back and still won the debate.﻿
z13xxrvplsuovjkdo234ufgipln0zh0oh04, 2015-10-30T03:39:47.125Z, Trump, Rubio, Cruz.  Christie WTF?!?!﻿
z12miv3wmmzfxhgam04chrhhnvf1hv5pti0, 2015-10-30T03:26:34.497Z, LMAO FOX News fair and balanced? wow!﻿
z12ehhrw2kbsx54qh04ce5krapqgytfplpw0k, 2015-10-30T03:24:06.756Z, Trump all day! Cruz is alright but sorta sounds like an infomercial. Marco  Rubio seems like he would have a very pro-illegal pro-mexico agenda instead  of being for America. Christie is a sellout shill statist.﻿
z12kgzw5dkf0hfbzc04cctf4opnhhbdjols0k, 2015-10-30T02:15:07.968Z, In the long run Cruze,Rubio,Chris,Carson and Trump would be way way way  better presidents then hitlery or Bernie Chavez﻿
z13hef4acprdgj3ka23ew30olniidn4ga04, 2015-10-30T01:38:13.414Z, Exclude the name bush from jeb's name and his number's on the polls fall,  dramatically. Jeb Bush is getting his getting his votes from name  recognition. Marco Rubio is the only GOP candidate that has a chance of  beating the democratic nominee .﻿
z12wipr5pyrkdfil523by3goxtzhufabv04, 2015-10-30T01:17:07.948Z, Marco Rubio should never be allowed to become a US president, he is an  insane CUBAN.﻿
z12ijrp5yyeagz5or04cc5norrr1fbvrck00k, 2015-10-29T23:10:02.778Z, The candidate that is the worse-Marco Rubio. Barely doing the job he has,  and, he lied, made promises to Florida voters, to get in the Senate. But,  barely shows up for work. Add his poor money management skills to his lack  of character and work ethic and you have Obama 2.0 the GOP version. He is  hands down unqualified for the job.﻿
z122fb3hgkzjfd0dj22pzbnollnfx1f2i, 2015-10-29T23:02:52.557Z, If we're gonna thin the heard, then for the love of god, get rid of those  who are polling lower than Hilary! So that would only leave Bush, Carson,  Rubio, and I think that's it! Hell, Cruz is getting beat by Clinton by 13 points in... the Fox News poll!﻿
z12pcdf5rru4gzm0v22zdxxzlt2pi5gtm, 2015-10-29T22:11:33.622Z, Rubio 2016!!!﻿
z12ve3pajpa3jrqqz04celszvwu3cbaqehs, 2015-10-29T22:05:14.277Z, RUBIO: So it's ok go miss the votes if others have done the same or worse.  Are we aiming for a higher standard or some more mediocrity. And lets all  attack the moderators and each other. These people are good at that and not  making any good relevant points or getting anything done.﻿
z13yevzznzaytxylq23bgrej5om2ytouc, 2015-10-29T21:06:28.779Z, I don't think these people get it. Trump doesn't hunt for party support. He  has he general populous' support. We decide not the GOP. Rubio is a whack  and has no chance.﻿
z13if5xq3nijzzfpk04cibrqktjfibuwuh4, 2015-10-29T20:24:45.117Z, Rubio couldn't pay his mortgage either.﻿
z123z1eo2qvdylyfd22ljvobzvj0u50vu, 2015-10-29T18:33:12.228Z, Rubio needs to dropout - we can't rely on a man who never attends meetings.   The Used Car Salesmen Ted Cruz who's trying to usurp Rand Paul's supporters, and that hack George Pataki should follow suit.  Way too much deadwood. Let's get it down to a single debate.﻿
z12eivgh3n35t1jcd22ljvobzvj0u50vu, 2015-10-29T18:26:24.027Z, This goof Rubio was chirping about slackers in the government.   Meanwhile he is becoming a Kim John Un look alike and never attends  meetings.﻿
z13mszab1t21uzgd423hu5ui4l3hip3ib04, 2015-10-29T18:16:09.829Z, Senator Ted Cruz crucified the CNBC Moderators! Home Run! All of GOP questions is an attack. Contrast that with the Democrat Debate!  LOL Which one of you is the most Handsome & Wise ? President Trump / V.P. Cruz  2016﻿
z13qj3sgyquvc532x23ng3wjztzawz4ly, 2015-10-29T17:49:54.807Z, Rubio is likable but he comes across as almost too slick sometimes, almost  like a sociopath. In contrast to Cruz, who's also very smart and is gifted  when it comes to speaking, but knows when he's grandstanding and owns it.  Rubio has more of a treacherous quality to me.﻿
z13ewfhzeoblydkh004cif051rmbgjgimbk, 2015-10-29T17:44:13.347Z, I think it's funny how the conservatives always love Fox News when they are  doing their Obama & Hillary hate routine, but then they're mad when they  support big-government conservative candidates like Bush and Rubio. Why?  They are nothing but a propaganda wing of the establishment and the power  elite. It's not that hard to figure out. They aren't on your side.﻿
z12wwne5czrtdjo2l23yudexsmijhzarp04, 2015-10-29T17:21:21.245Z, RNC and FOX have clear bias for Rubio. HYPOCRITES!﻿
z12vzdgakpm1hxgpw04ccbb5kta3sjs51ig, 2015-10-29T16:46:05.708Z, Trump said he didn't call Rubio "Zuckerbergs's Personal Sentor". But.. it  turns out he did actually said that on his web site?? And you guys think he  won the debate?? I thought he did okay but this Zuckerbergs thing nearly  destroyed him and I think he'll trails in the new polls. I think Cruz and  Rubio both won the debates. The loser was Bush, he should drop out now.  CNBC are also the losers.﻿
z12ojljquliyy5a2q23uwragivrdilvgq04, 2015-10-29T16:29:53.668Z, "There you go again."The mainstream media trying to impose on people who's  the winner. Marco rubio winner on immigration,really?﻿
z12ofnbpwo32hjuci22efzqaklyex5pd3, 2015-10-29T15:16:00.734Z, KASICH IS AN IDIOT. RUBIO IS A MODERATE - WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU  FOX????!!!!﻿
z135ffcgusasjlore04ci5bqwvvnxf4j0sg0k, 2015-10-29T14:35:31.700Z, Well the establishment got a new golden boy , Marco Rubio is now being  pushed by the pundits on all the news stations. They must think fox viewers  never got past kindergarten using those ridiculous signs.﻿
z12nihkivqq3w14mr23st1tgyzuked4nd, 2015-10-29T14:11:42.765Z, What a surprise. Krauthammer liked Rubio. Amnesty will kill the country.﻿
z12fwzuqkkacyhql322pv3ah0prqzhbvt, 2015-10-29T12:56:53.662Z, Trumps closing statement at the end of the debate was epic. He won the  debate with that closing statement right there. The nomination is  over...the rest can go home.﻿
z131gvnqanywtvtba04cevbwuvyxzdfix04, 2015-10-29T11:45:49.001Z, After seeing this debate, If you still don't believe that the liberal  propaganda media wants to destroy any and all vestiges of Conservatism then  you yourself are a brainwashed liberal moron that should work in the fetus  sales department at Planned Parenthood.﻿
z13rupdopx3wfxuyg04ccnjxzqn2zrzw2qs0k, 2015-10-29T11:01:15.286Z, Rubio won, but CNBC lost to all debaters﻿
z135e55a5r30uj3mi22eehbavsmogly20, 2015-10-29T09:11:27.320Z, In my opinion, I think the CNBC moderators did a hell of a lot better job  than the Fox panel. And I love how the audience cheered when both Rubio and  Cruz called them out on it.﻿
z13lttuwhwa2u1yij04cctwjkqqkv1i4kho, 2015-10-29T06:57:09.833Z, Props to all republicans finally unifying. Tonight was a great step for all  the candidates. They completely destroyed those moderators. The false  claims they put against Trump, and Carson was absolutely ridiculous. Props  to Cruz and Huckabee for standing up for their rivals. Very strong night  for everyone that isn't named Rubio, Bush, Kasich.﻿
z13wznzgvqbjdhjvl23owxdrovq5xldeb, 2015-10-29T06:55:26.482Z, There are too many people on the stage.. the Dem debate had like 4 on  stage.﻿

z12bilzraqenxbrbn04ce5cijtmci5t4anc0k, 2015-10-29T04:47:08.912Z, Trump is awesome.﻿
z13qu3jwaneiiz3wc04ci5ohvku5sbtzwa4, 2015-10-29T04:08:40.920Z, Wait i thought Conservatives wanted smaller Government... now you want the  State to tell every county who they can and cant elect?? how convenient﻿
z13xv14qjyqadjyug23cvj1xqzr4tzxwr04, 2015-10-28T22:58:17.386Z, Rubio is full of crap.   Rand has a nearly flawless voting record, Sanders is doing fine, even Cruz  has an ok record.   He just sucks at his job. That's it. He showed up recently just to say that  government employees who don't show up for work should be fired. Lol you  can't make this up.﻿
z134wbyy3qbyerxce23kujjiounvw1bnr, 2015-10-28T16:50:51.277Z, I hope Rubio, Fiorina and Kassich stand out. Any one of These 3 can kick  Hillary's ass in the general, basically assuring a win for the GOP.﻿
z12zf5jbxor5jz0us220j5sytkrlylanr, 2015-10-28T13:37:54.824Z, RUbio needs to get out of this race, no track record﻿
z12zvbdb5wfmix3na22zdxxzlt2pi5gtm, 2015-10-28T04:55:16.875Z, Rubio 2016!!﻿
z13kexaz4yq1unueq232etnb0naddbygj04, 2015-10-28T02:02:33.050Z, Funny, if it was bush and Rubio on top they would be referring them to  being on the top tier. But because its trump and Carson, they are sure that  the polls really dont matter. Had it been any other 2 polling the same the  media would be talking a different story﻿
z12czpmrauymyvysp23ltnzg4nmxchigk04, 2015-10-27T23:21:06.969Z, Paul has time. His message is solid, and regular. In time, Cruz, Bush,  Rubio and Huckabee will all fall off, and Paul will gain steam as the  attacks are intensified, and platforms are scrutinized. He is the best  Republican candidate to offer who can win swing votes. So I think his  campaign will grow in the spring of next year if he hangs in tough.﻿
z12gx3ljpuj5zjzzc04cjdzadsz5wzjo5o00k, 2015-10-27T20:25:58.379Z, Turd Blossom is still polishing the Bush family's turds. Jeb is doomed and  the GOP will crumble under the idiocy of Trump and Carson, which is one  step from President Commacho. Rubio? Ha! There is no chance for our young  and thirsty friend. Face it right wingnuts your going to have to start  Feeling the Bern if you want to back a winner. ﻿
z13zudfq0tqxxlbrg04cebap0qbpjhhqjpg0k, 2015-10-27T18:32:55.746Z, Boy, Fox is really scared of Ted Cruz. Even though he is #3 on their poll,  they cut his name out and only show Rubio and Bush as if Cruz didn't even  register. I bet this anchor got in trouble for accidentally verbally  mentioning that Cruz was in 3rd place. Fox should be ashamed.﻿
z13ng3qy5xyrdbwml23uwzkjlrzvcrg0r, 2015-10-27T18:17:42.696Z, rubio/kasich 2016!!﻿

z12qjz25mtbch13xp04cizoqqmvhhxwqs2c, 2015-10-27T14:41:50.340Z, Rubio goes on Univision and says he is giving illegals amnesty. Then he  goes on Fox news and says something different.Sorry I am a legal Hispanic  and I agree with Trump.My whole family is voting Trump.﻿

z13oxln4nq35wnvkv22su3mphrbjixwy104, 2015-10-26T18:08:33.390Z, Rubio joined the Senate for the notoriety and the future pay check.  One  term and out then he's gonna take that big lobbying job he probably already  has lined up.  Running for the presidency is a shot in the dark for him  that I believe he knows he doesn't have a chance in hell of winning.  He's  doing that for the money, and again the notoriety so he can command more  money in that dream lobbying job he can't wait to get.﻿

z13pfxmqetjwwhxzk04cgndhluqag3xo2lo0k, 2015-10-23T23:07:37.306Z, There are plenty of people that refer to themselves as "free market  capitalists" that don't support cutting all regulations and privatizing  everything the government currently controls.  It's GOOD to be a moderate on either side. Bernie is a moderate socialist  just like most conservatives are moderate capitalists.  Foxtards at it again, smh.﻿
z130xrcihlafx1sma23wjh2igybrsfedk, 2015-10-23T20:17:30.693Z, When it's a concentrated effort campaign by the MSM saying he's going to  drop out BUT never a word about Krispy Kreme, Graham, Jindal, or any of the  others polling below him!!!!!!!﻿

z12zx3ryinq0tvbxe04cerggto2qyvxozj4, 2015-10-22T02:07:57.425Z, Mitch McConnel is a spineless RINO who is more concerned with being in  Obama's good graces than for standing up for protecting the American  people. Ted Cruz is the only candidate other than Trump that would shake up  DC the most. Sink the RINOS﻿
z13iifxrqmazvv1ie04chdl4epyfs1uagks0k, 2015-10-21T21:37:36.776Z, Hannity just cant stop being a total cock sucker. He talks and acts like a  weak faggot everytime he´s interviewing Trump. I bet the Blonde Asshole  Clown pays him 250k a month to have him kiss his ass and lick his shoes.  What a disgusting piece of shit.﻿
z13ouvjrzrfnyhp4h04cij3agpmxh1irdf4, 2015-10-21T19:55:26.224Z, A fact that can't be denied by either side. Bush, Rubio, Clinton... They  are all complete puppets to Koch, Soros, Wall Street...﻿

z13kgpuhvm3qw1rkw22rvlhozwegglebc04, 2015-10-21T02:06:21.459Z, Rubio is just like another politician who wants to lie to seem better. if  he had more money he could have just flat out said so. be proud of ur money  and say that u got it, instead of moving around the question with a  misleading answer.﻿
z133xjw54kufw1lru04ch11orwfutnhifec, 2015-10-20T22:52:50.124Z, Gang of 8 is weighing you down Rubio. Best thing you said, "Don't watch the  show, it's a free country".﻿

z13cg5qhbtepibxm323etfujpt3ucddkc, 2015-10-15T18:11:47.251Z, Ted, No one cares about you and we know you lie 60% of the time. Which  makes you as bad as Hilary. Rubio, "lib vs lib",great you found out this  was a democratic debate. My question is why can't Republican debates have  hard questions like the Democratic Debate, instead of Trump said this and  what is your response, Trump you get to respond. That would actually imply  Republicans have polices to talk about instead of wedge issues to glorify.﻿
z13ft5pwpzevshqjk04cede50ti4edfazfo, 2015-10-15T03:43:40.155Z, Trump Wins 2016 and selects Ben Carson as vice president and us American  people win. In 2024 Ben Carson Wins and selects Marco Rubio as vice  president and once again us American people win. Repeat the trend﻿

z13fvdipbovisr01a22quj04hyivg3syx04, 2015-10-15T00:39:06.823Z, Donald Trump is a joke, Jeb Bush is a joke, Marco Rubio is a joke, Ted Cruz  is a joke, Ben Carson is a joke, The Republicans are a joke, Fox News is a  joke. But none of this is making me laugh anymore. The games over, Bernie  Sanders is going to win, and we will get the money out of politics. Then  media channels like Fox News will have to earn their money the old  fashioned way by actually doing real reporting and not taking bribes from  the rich. We will get our democracy back.﻿

However, trump has a point ..still, he is unbelievable  amateur and his 3 rd wife is Slovenian lingerie model and also immigrant .  He has no right to attack Jeb bush's Mexican wife, okay with accusation  like him. My question is : Do you really want a Slovenian model as First  Lady, conservative people ? Are you France? ﻿

This is why they will be  thrown out of office in 2016. Repubs have ONE idea,,, cut taxes for the  rich and increase military and police spending. When trickle down economic,  perpetual war, and mass imprisonment failed they were out of ideas. Nothing  is left but a hollow shell.﻿
z13aulsorobvf125x04cen4ylmijzjw5rys0k, 2015-10-12T16:54:41.142Z, To me..personally...the perfect candidate is one with Obamas views, but  Marco Rubio's military mentality. ..John Kasich is surprisingly close to  fitting that bill﻿

z133z5ujsnjqhno1t220chszwnmjwfxkb, 2015-10-07T20:23:20.021Z, As an African American female of a 21-year old son, Marco Rubio is reading  the justice system's mail. He has my vote!﻿
z13yw1xaboy4i3iyr04cj3bqmny4xj2oexg0k, 2015-10-07T17:21:14.077Z, watch, rubio will be going down the polls soon﻿
z13xtb1o2k2ogfg2f22yt3lajse5y10zg04, 2015-10-07T16:40:38.320Z, Rubio hasnt been voting???﻿
z13xzropvoznh5cbv04cg3tqfxj4tz543eo, 2015-10-07T16:18:24.856Z, Trump would eat Rubio like a lamb chop.  Marco Rubio is a fake conservative and the republican version of Obama. He  just recently paid off his student loans and is the biggest lightweight in  this race. Not only does he need to drop out of this race, he needs to leave the  United States senate.  he has been a horrible senator and is bought and paid for by the Washington  lobbyist. Go back to Florida, Marco!  #Trump2016﻿
z13osbg5xofpubzgj04ccb5jqr3dt12wduc0k, 2015-10-07T15:14:06.708Z, Trump saying about Rubio "He only had $12 in the bank" lololol﻿
z133gbzb3xetczy5v04ccb5jqr3dt12wduc0k, 2015-10-07T14:51:52.916Z, OMG I nearly fell off my couch yesterday, Trump was being interviewed on  CNN and he was talking about Rubio and he said "Rubio is a lightweight, he  only has $12 in the bank" lololol﻿
z120utpgpyrpunfm0235cdfzwpzqy3d1c, 2015-10-07T11:48:00.705Z, rubio has the brain of a chicken.﻿
z12owb2w2znxwzber22aet55gvfdufx4i04, 2015-10-07T11:34:15.475Z, this Jamie Weinstein is either Rubio's brother or husband﻿
z135tbbwbvvwtnenm23wt5ep0z2fuhulc, 2015-10-07T06:46:25.903Z, RUBIO IS A SHILL... HE IS JUST AS BAD AS HILLARY THE WITCH CLINTON﻿
z12ccbhp3vn4sjfkb22eih54vku1sp3uw, 2015-10-07T06:37:18.891Z, I think a Rubio/Fiorina ticket is what the Ass Party fears most.  And that idiot Kevin McCarthy should sit back down, shut up, and let  someone with brains and some conservative courage lead the House.﻿
z12zvncprwn0ylxxd04cjhnwdn2wwhuouok0k, 2015-10-07T06:20:28.302Z, IS RUBIO LOYAL TO US OR HIS MOTHERLAND ? if Marco win forget about amerce ,  it will  be Mexico , and the the other will be minority, look what Mexican  did to Mexico,﻿

z13aefrrbme4wjelf233txmg2smhxtypi04, 2015-10-07T03:13:33.257Z, Trump is the best, but this whole drama with the Fox embargo followed by  reconciliation is, I think, all for show. It pumps up the ratings of both  Trump and Fox. By the way, regarding "Rubio is a clown," remember that  O'Reilly calls people "pinheads" every day for a living.﻿
z12zy3vgxviafphde22hudmxemeazfszv04, 2015-10-07T03:11:50.749Z, Rubio's long term biggest contributor is Goldman Sachs.  That's all I need to know.﻿

z13hxv2j4yfuifxqd04cehh5vtztvha400c, 2015-10-06T21:13:41.367Z, Rubio is Not His own man.﻿
z12ixl5jbmn4x1b1v23gidjqakejujfzk04, 2015-10-06T20:28:35.847Z, This is absurd. Rubio is not serious and attracts about 1% the attention  that Trump attracts. No one cares what Rubio has to say; no one even knows  what Rubio has to say on issues. What is the Rubio plan on ...anything? No  one can answer that question...except maybe 1%.﻿
z13ce5j4at3bdtrop04cj52ofpvpz5vbvaw, 2015-10-06T20:22:04.852Z, I'm hoping for Carson or Rubio.﻿

z13lfzt4jnygf1hu023ojjs4ttmev15lh, 2015-10-06T16:36:21.562Z, Trump is the only one right about Russia.Let Russia have the useless  muzzies. Rubio and Fiorina are the same old traditional neo-cons. It is time we are represented differently.﻿
z12zilzodv2rvpxa404cilxz0nbadfg4q5o, 2015-10-06T16:32:23.396Z, Good Job Fox. Don't mention Donald attacking Rubio for his push for amnesty.﻿
z13euda5vrv5g5e4g04cipcg4vuyfxoqzes, 2015-10-06T15:51:09.884Z, Rubio has no idea what we in Europe think about that clown, please do not  vote for this douchebag, he has no Idea how to rule a country like USA.  Vote for Trump, he knows how to run a business. He is smart and care more  about US then about Israel,Iraq,Iran or whoever, cheers from Germany.﻿

z120ynbxbnjdclnrh04ccbjigyuovfzrefw, 2015-10-06T14:00:39.074Z, Dr. Ben Carson is such a bright man...People please no more political  assumption please... please get this man on the power who has the solutions  for people. Dr. Ben Carson is such a good man who wants to listen and  collaborate with people... God bless America﻿
z12dvb3bfuqojvgnj22aet55gvfdufx4i04, 2015-10-06T12:41:22.069Z, I really like carson and enjoy listening to him talk but I must go with  trump he just has that natural leader feel...also fox news takes the time  to hunt down the best poll where trump has lower % but they wont take the  time to find the (legit good) polls where trump is ahead by alot.﻿

Carson and Rubio are already in the hip-pockets of his billionaires! And that is why the major news networks “down” Trump every whenever they can BECAUSE they want a BIG piece of their money-pie in advertising!

z13lvxnrvoy1sbvrs04cen4ylmijzjw5rys0k, 2015-10-06T10:25:15.093Z, I'm a democrat who is watching Rubio closely. This guy has a good chance.  Young, well-spoken with a strong character. Something like a Republican  Obama. I hope he tones down the republican rhetoric a bit if he does make  it to prime time.  Kasich is also a GREAT republican candidate, but seems like the public, or  media has little interest in him.﻿
z13zgdlhzmrywfm3x23cch5z2yqgvfmum, 2015-10-06T06:02:53.458Z, Mr. Gang of 8 doesn't stand a chance and his taunting of Putin will only  get the US into WW3. Rubio is an idiot.﻿
z12tepdzyl2jermum22ws3vq1sjcihjow04, 2015-10-06T03:45:29.907Z, I watch middle-east news, and I heat what arab, Iranians, and Russian  analysts say...and Rubio is the only one who truly gets it!﻿

z12eurmjmnnjsvxxs04cdpqosky3j1z4yog0k, 2015-10-06T01:58:28.678Z, Rubio is an idiot political pussy. He will say he thinks the brainwashed  Americans need to hear to stay in their coma. Good job boy...atta boy don't  wake em up. Besides the powers that be want Clinton as president. You can  not have a feudal state with armed Americans and she is big time against an  informed public that has the right to own and bear arms.﻿

z12efn34hr3zi33ov04cdrlx0wadgtwrgk00k, 2015-10-05T18:44:00.997Z, i support trump 100%, but everytime i see a picture or a clip or a video of  him i always see him very distressed. why does he look like that all the  time?! whatever is bothering him, he should ignore it and focus on the  presidential race. #trump2016!﻿
z134sbgj3nupzpucm235zjly2yi2fvf3x, 2015-10-05T18:07:08.816Z, Trump is back to where he was because some other candidates are getting  9's. Trump surged to 30-40 because Bush and Walker were plummeting. Now  it's Fiorina and Rubio. But just wait until people find out what they are  worth. He will stay in the lead by a great margin and outrun everyone again  soon.﻿
z13rijkwvtz0djfdv22aet55gvfdufx4i04, 2015-10-05T17:03:34.536Z, you know what I'm pretty sure fox news has made 11 videos or more in the  last month about how donald trump is going down in polls which probably  just backfires and helps him go up in polls lol nice try fox trump 2016!!﻿
z12chtpb2yubjnd1t23gt31ptnqgydsor04, 2015-10-04T21:05:43.321Z, Rubio lost me on this one. There is no such thing as a good or moderate  terrorist. Russia is going to get rid off ALL terrorist and leave Assad.  Sound good to me.﻿
z120tbuoiruovnet122lydgy3zyvdvbyh04, 2015-10-04T15:01:26.083Z, Rubio is a disaster. Sweaty child that should not be even near the Senate.﻿
z13sct1bpsugfjyml23uttrauzmztjpnh, 2015-10-04T01:24:07.539Z, Marco Rubio is brainless he speaks like a uneducated spoil brat. This guy  is a danger to himself and the world don't listen to this thug. His view  towards Syria are beyond stupid and his ideas are childish.﻿

z12bfdvjzqisgbcix04cg3fo3sn1vliwaic, 2015-10-03T16:10:40.115Z, Bush may be bad but Rubio is a greasy piece of traitorous shit who should  be deported.﻿
z12ij3lapmfjeltrt04cjf0rdkurid0i2kc0k, 2015-10-03T15:57:17.143Z, How big a setback is it - fantastic answer from Rubio who shows that it is  not about Syria it's just showing that US is the macho biggest kid in the  playground! When he talks about the national interest he is really talking  about protecting the Zionists in Israel. His dream of a Sunni coalition  fighting against the Shiite Assad Regime and its Shiite Allies in Irag/Iran  shows how little he understands the regions politics. It would generate a  far more massive civil war.﻿
z12oyvxxtompxtvit04ce1capluquh4ybi4, 2015-10-03T12:56:47.999Z, shut up rubio nobody likes you. ﻿

z12pfndhqzbxfbl4304ch11orwfutnhifec, 2015-10-03T03:00:51.493Z, Rubio, you are weak, you won't do anything to Putin. The Russian leader  wouldn't even give you the time of day. Go back to your lego blocks and let  men of action like Trump handle it. That's right action, the thing you  haven't done in the Senate while Obama has his way with you. Grow a  backbone and try again for 2025.﻿
z13sclnqcp34xbxpv04cetopuyifdtz433s, 2015-10-03T01:46:34.017Z, Kasich/Rubio - Can't lose in general﻿
z12lhdxygn3bvlwun224gvczqpzvuvsfp, 2015-10-02T22:19:18.388Z, Rubio has no idea. There is a choice between ISIS and Jabat Al Nusra and  that is all. This guy has no clue. "Moderate" FSA does not exist. The only  sustained charter of the insurgents is the Qu'ran and Hadith. There are no  rebels fighting for liberal constitutional secular democracy or any other  modern ideology. Marco Rubio is another clown.﻿

Syria should be cleaned from all kinds of terrorists and then international  community should force Syrian government to have free elections.﻿

z13jufobxxnqxb3as04cebhwbni3wrjogjk, 2015-10-01T17:08:17.063Z, Rubio makes good speeches. Barack Obama makes good speeches, too. Other  than speeches, what does Rubio actually bring? I like Rubio, don't get me  wrong, but I just need substance over style. I need more than just another  good speech. What has Rubio... done?﻿

z124sfkh5qmmhhimh23xcf0xaqb4shukg, 2015-10-01T15:36:28.067Z, Trump posted a video of Rubio totally subservient to jewish donors. Rubio  is a typical politician who bends his values for cash and even tried to  pass obama's amnesty program.﻿

z13ovx5qjzurfz1mo222xhsjulbad1vcs, 2015-10-01T15:01:58.660Z, Rubio seems to know what he is talking about on foreign policy but is his  record on immigration reform stinks .... and he doesn't seem to be working  for the people with his absentees in Congress .... Cruz is much better at  doing his actual job .... what about his views on taxes and the economy  .... Trumps plan seems better﻿
z12ixxnhgpnbsfsod04cizoqqmvhhxwqs2c, 2015-10-01T14:51:25.086Z, Rubio let Russia fight Isis. Why are we getting into all these wars. We got  in it in Iraq and they didn't even thank us.

z125chq50v3wwzgvo22axxu52rn1u3hzt04, 2015-10-01T06:19:37.616Z, Rubio is the only guy running for the Republicans who knows WTF he's  talking about when it comes to foreign policy. Trump is a complete moron  who doesn't know didly squat and just spouts generalities that are popular  with fellow ignorant imbeciles.﻿
z12ejblofrrmir4zm04ch11orwfutnhifec, 2015-10-01T05:28:31.882Z, Rubio, you are all over the place. You want to rule the Middle East and  have no idea how to do it so give it up and take care of America. Let  Russia figure out Syria.﻿
z124id5hanbustwcx23cch5z2yqgvfmum, 2015-10-01T05:25:48.942Z, Rubio's response to you Megyn is "Duuuuuhhhh!" I wonder if Megyn thinks  that's sexist to be told how obvious it was to figure out what Russia is  doing.﻿

z121yjcrzmanzrkg404cdxjjupegxlprzx40k, 2015-10-01T03:06:16.295Z, Rubio predicted nothing.  Do a search on the committees he sits on.  The  man is in the Know Zone.  Russia has been putting out signals about what it  intends to do in Syria and for Syria since well before the last Republican  debate.﻿
z13bhfh5anfngrhr204ch50jrkmujzlbxoo0k, 2015-10-01T02:52:03.354Z, Let them take out ISIS then...we or whomever take out Assad. It's one or  the other. I say a planned strategy or one then the other. I suppose Trump  kinda had a good perspective on it. With that said though, Rubio  essentially wanted to "prop" up other middle east citizens to do the  fighting. This is a plan with far too many variables. With such a dangerous  situation, you can TRUST anyone. Let Putin have it of it means the rest of  the planet is less one more threat in the end.﻿

z12wwx3hqvjxstltw22wxllo2quezbfbn04, 2015-09-30T15:04:59.303Z, I liked Rubio because he was silent about Trump. Just made me want to vote  Trump even more.﻿
z13gdjq4uke4hfqhv04cc1zgxn2zfhzhoz40k, 2015-09-30T15:01:27.584Z, Rubio will be exiting the race soon...lol﻿
z13re10rerrdfrnvs23tuhz5evytf5emy, 2015-09-30T14:04:30.452Z, It's too bad Rubio and Trump have issues. That would be the perfect ticket.  Trump's celebrity and passion and Rubio's knowledge on policy and his  Hispanic background.﻿
z12tsxmqnxmzyv1j004cjvgjgufvs3lasi4, 2015-09-30T13:00:13.330Z, I am from FLORIDA.... Marco Rubio has the worst attendance record in the  Senate. Rubio was pushing hard for Amnesty..... Floridians do NOT trust  him!.... So what if he is good at his Debate Skill? That's all he is, a  smooth talker. He has done NOTHING for Florida... absolutely NOTHING.....  so why is the FOX promoting him? Because he has the SUPPORT of the Koch  Brothers and the Corrupt Establishment.﻿
z124hvaaykzhutmtd23zfrbwizmjhdmqh04, 2015-09-30T10:52:22.545Z, Rubio makes a great point about Iran and their motives for nuclear  weapons.  Using common sense why would you give Iran nuclear weapons  capability.﻿
z13jw1aa4mqdtnrdo22otbognnzvz1hzq04, 2015-09-30T10:42:48.662Z, I like Rubio's military stance.. I hope he tones down the Republican  rhetoric a bit if he makes the general election.﻿
z13vynha0vmww3onu221ynoy1wibtlq2r, 2015-09-30T10:38:28.993Z, go Putin Rubio is a globalist puppet!﻿
z133ulhjommqi32fv221ynoy1wibtlq2r, 2015-09-30T10:36:57.928Z, Rubio obviously works for the globalist RINO﻿
z13veflzrmatgnpvb22yilbzkkjksxmul, 2015-09-30T09:32:07.359Z, Trump calling Rubio a clown was putting it nicely!! Most of these has been  failed politicians are the worst of the worst, and the country's downfall  is a direct reflection of that very failure. In that respect Trump is very  presidential to call a spade a spade. A fair question would be why does  O'reilly not get that part, or the importance of it. Trump 2016!!﻿
z13pvfvwjyyus1rd423ojjs4ttmev15lh, 2015-09-30T09:19:39.139Z, Oh Rubio needs to shut up. He'll bring us to WW3 should he ever get into office.Same with Fiorina. Trump 2016. He's right about Russia.We need to work together.﻿
z13eirnzclf5xhnnt23avpsyquq0vr44k04, 2015-09-30T08:17:04.414Z, If I want a Cuban President I will live in Cuba. Rubio..not fit to be an  American President! TRUMP ALL THE WAY!!!﻿

z130tr4ylvnatjvg404ceh2pnnyrdrzxcyg0k, 2015-09-30T04:34:18.887Z, Rubio has been planted by the military industrial complex hell he may not  even be human maybe he's a robot think about it he sweats a lot drinks a  lot of water what's wrong with him﻿
z12sctqwzsvcw3uyd04cg3tqfxj4tz543eo, 2015-09-30T04:33:16.574Z, I can't wait to call him President Trump☺ #MakeAmericaGreatAgain﻿
z13dzzajlzf2xhsxy04cf10qpnj3sj2zz40, 2015-09-30T04:06:00.442Z, Screw Rubio! Hes nothing put another paid for worthless CLOWN that does  nothing except what he is told to do. LOOK AT THIS COUNTRY and remember  Rubio is responsible for why it is in the shape it is because he and all  the other worthless politicians put America in the spot it is. Anyone who  does not show up to vote should be removed from office unless they were in  the hospital! Thats the kind of DO NOTHING DO AS THEY TELL YOU piece of  crap he is! TRUMP 2016!﻿
z12rdhs41zqfd1ztn22rzpizrqaegt1t3, 2015-09-30T03:50:50.989Z, is it presidential to call another country's president a gangster? what's  wrong with these gop candidates?﻿
z12heboa3qussdlk223bs51x0y2ju1xzo04, 2015-09-30T03:42:44.486Z, Trump should have just confirmed "yeah Rubio is a clown"  Its it  Presidential to call him that? He should have just said "Yeah its  Presidential because I say it is."... then it would be all over. Putin says  that kind of shit all the time and look at him, he is the leader of the  free world and protector of civilization.﻿
z13avl54bvmgclgy004cdz1zasjmxneyj2s, 2015-09-30T03:24:31.570Z, hey Rubio isis us proxies army you dumb beaner﻿
z13yy10wjkiwtzj4d04cdz1zasjmxneyj2s, 2015-09-30T03:23:34.506Z, Rubio looks cock eyed and coked out﻿
z13mxvxzrwjwz1wdz23uwrkyzyzuebesy, 2015-09-30T03:06:36.837Z, True. Rubio is part of that out of touch political class.﻿
z13odzdztufexrs0523yv3vamyy0wdq3l, 2015-09-30T02:44:07.478Z, The Koch Brothers are supporting Bush, Rubio, and Fiorina..... So it's NOT  a surprise for those who are paying attention that......all FOX wants to  talk about now are Bush, Rubio, and Fiorina.﻿
z13ft32rsyzhgn2nj225ctnycmmewvyh404, 2015-09-30T01:59:20.270Z, Rubio is a Child that has problems of his own. Amnesty for one. First term  senator for two. Never did anything close to Trump in building anything.  And from past statements we would not be in the current mess we find  ourselves in in the middle east.﻿
z13qhxzglnbgyhdjk04cgrxybsftsdjhgjo, 2015-09-29T12:49:03.520Z, Your dear colleague FRANK LUNTZ has said that they only booed in agreement  with Trump when he called Rubio a Clown.﻿
z13hhhvzhlfndxe3j22wxllo2quezbfbn04, 2015-09-29T12:02:16.571Z, I like Rubio, but I like trump better. I just wish Trump didn't want to  deport illegals. I wish he would just have them do community service  building the wall to gain citizenship. I love the Hispanic people, and I do  think they should face some type of charges if they came in illegally, but  sending them back could be very expensive, and it doesn't sound humane.﻿
z12mhp4xztz4x32zf04ci5vw0knsi55xpsg0k, 2015-09-29T11:21:32.513Z, RINO Rubio is NOT a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN as required to be President﻿
z12mvjwp5pvkcpz4x04cjjmp3lafxvezjvk0k, 2015-09-29T09:11:48.085Z, he only got booed calling him a clown, cuz that clown had already spoke to  those people before trump.﻿
z13bcxo55x3ght1lq23cch5z2yqgvfmum, 2015-09-29T07:26:42.658Z, If they think Rubio and his Gang of 8 are going to break out, he should  hold his breath now.﻿
z12ggdvbvqnrs1h3l225u1uysxagx5d1o, 2015-09-29T04:30:29.435Z, marco Rubio for president.﻿
z12lhtvocxffirzrb04cfj05pu35elaqrig, 2015-09-29T03:04:53.145Z, Jeb Bush (along with Fiorina, Cruz, and Rubio) are H1-B visa scam  supporters and therefore traitors to the American middle class. No vote on  Jeb...shill to Indian lobbyists and overpaid tech execs.﻿
z12yxhnh0zasst4kt22pvdgydrapx3uls, 2015-09-28T17:29:20.490Z, I really love how ironic this video is. Trump - once again, having the gall  - to slam Carly Fiorina for how she led her company when Trump BANKRUPTED  FOUR BUSINESSES. Fox isn't going to bring up that fact though. Talk about  glass houses and stones whenever Trump opens his mouth!﻿
z12vevnjdkrwwbud422xs1zztyisctynq, 2015-09-28T05:19:57.252Z, The last thing the world needs is a fifth term from a BUSH ...﻿
z13yixtw5kfbibg4e04cch3ikpqtc3tito00k, 2015-09-28T03:28:28.909Z, My choice will be Rubio because his ideas best represent America to the  world  though acknowledging his father ' s family are asylum seekers from Cuba ,  which is unfair disadvantage for him in political arena. Carson , Fiorina  are simply incapable of doing commander in chief and moderators, and trump  is liberal -his current wife is Slovenian lingerie model And true ignorant  of foreign affairs   Can Rubio beat Bernie Chavez? Yes!﻿
z13iznnrkqarw1hdm223cvo5hqe0yfqh004, 2015-09-28T03:16:28.424Z, Rubio is the most fitted American candidate so far. He is an immigrant  family from Cuba So, He cherishes best American values than bush family or  Clintons. He knows how economy works in practice and exactly understand  what freedom is in every aspect of human lives . With all that said , he is  real conservative and Reaganism In national security and foreign policy﻿
z13mclgrupedytqpi04cfzs4xqakvj0rk0o, 2015-09-27T23:38:17.693Z, is islam consistent with the constitution is a very loaded question. i  don't think there was a way for him to answer this question without pissing  someone off.﻿
z12wub1wdwzvujv34230epoxworofj1lb, 2015-09-27T19:53:00.793Z, Rubio is all talk and no action. VOTE TRUMP!﻿
z12nizt4kryog3pcn23wx5foeuyqxn3z404, 2015-09-27T18:29:55.081Z, Team Rubio. I'm not here for Secretary of State Omarosa.﻿
z13dfncjnl3iidex304cjjeb2yzmghm5xtc0k, 2015-09-27T09:45:59.757Z, Marco Rubio, I'm writing you off. Until this video, I really liked you. I'm  actually glad you revealed your true nature as an advocate for victim  mentality. Now I can scratch you off of my very short list of legitimate  Presidential candidates.﻿
z13pch5z4km1vxuef23ffnpyalqshnmul, 2015-09-26T13:20:51.850Z, herr Bohner youre too liberal beter the hard guys Robin Batman Trump or  Marco Rubio :-)﻿
z13phlgapxfufnzxl04cjndpesvcs5p4vvw0k, 2015-09-26T00:29:55.684Z, I like Trump, but not for president. If he gets the nod, Hillary will scoop  up ALL the Hispanic, Black, Gay, Muslim, Feminist, and Moderate voters,  which collectively are a landslide. Trump is a typical CEO, he says and  behaves as he wishes because the minions would never challenge him. The  American public does not work that way, and they will certainly not forget  or forgive his behavior. Fiona, Carson, or even Rubio are the only ones  that have any shot.﻿
z135dhmzwzyxcvanq222xhsjulbad1vcs, 2015-09-25T19:46:22.464Z, Who is Kaish ... Ha , ha .... I like Trump, Cruz, Christie, Rubio, or  Fiorina ... the rest have issues﻿
z122xfdqolqchrh5i04cf5jockrctr1p4ek, 2015-09-25T18:28:11.729Z, You want to compare policies? Trump has detailed policies on his site,  rubio has a series of 50-second youtube videos. Don't believe me? Check for  yourself: https://marcorubio.com/issues/﻿
z12qfzrj1yuow1fcu23ystpgmrfkffq5i04, 2015-09-25T17:46:48.418Z, Rubio is an anchor baby who will bring in more latinos﻿
z12ojzoxey2cdj1uq222xhsjulbad1vcs, 2015-09-25T14:59:52.191Z, We need someone to stop illegal immigration ... bring back jobs and  companies,  decrease the deficit,  and strengthen the military ... My money  is on Rubio , Cruz, Fiorina, Christie, or Trump having the best chance at  pulling it off ....... Bush and Carson don't have the leadership qualities  needed IMHO ...﻿
z13xfphjbnjucnjmu23ge5yqxkzfunxtu, 2015-09-25T14:08:55.018Z, The real surprise was that he was ever considered a viable candidate - he  is a creation of party insiders who were looking for their perfect  candidate, completely independent of anything in the interest of the  people. They found him, and dumped $35M into his campaign, and it has all  gone pair shaped. Rubio is next - guaranteed.﻿
z13byd34jzbfw5ilu22jtdfxcxnqjjeyl04, 2015-09-25T13:52:19.016Z, Rubio just got his ass handed to him yet again in this interview.  He's a BABY and a Jeb Bush MINI-ME !  People are sick of ESTABLISHMENT Republicans and that is why the polls are  the way they are.  Give us a DARN WALL...Give us Our Jobs back that got sent to China by  liberal bastards and restore the nation as a beacon of the world instead of  going galavanting around the planet spending TAX PAYER MONEY on stupidity.﻿
z12pgxb4gzm1ynmkt22jtdfxcxnqjjeyl04, 2015-09-25T13:43:26.640Z, Like I said before Rubio is not smart enough to be president...He is still  in diapers. There's nothing wrong to go there but to do it on a Jewish Holiday is the  stupidity of it, that shows his inexperience. You gotta be smarter than that during campaigns.﻿
z13evpcwvom0xprbq04cirhbkyfnu33bwwo0k, 2015-09-25T11:26:42.257Z, Love this mans integrity and honesty. Will be a great president. Carson  Rubio great ticket.﻿
z12hxnbbhmy1tzyvg223slhhflipw5baa04, 2015-09-25T07:29:43.015Z, You only need 1 brain cell to understand what Carson was saying, why does  American media always take a snippet from a conversation and turn it into a  controversy? Trump was asked 'we have a problem with Muslims.....?' No one  fussed abut that question.﻿
z13bh3jy0nbzezlgy04ch11orwfutnhifec, 2015-09-25T06:29:59.038Z, Trump has better policies than the child Rubio.﻿
z13ftfrbkvvoenfk323pczlp3qriynikk, 2015-09-25T06:03:15.110Z, As I really observed Carly Fiorina speaking at the second debate, I didn't  feel she was steely-eyed so much as she was glacial and callous, almost  cold and hard-hearted. Could that be what Mr. Trump meant? After all she  eliminated jobs when she was a CEO with the same heartlessness I  experienced when my professional position was eliminated and was told to  clear my office in one hour. I feel Mr. Trump as president and Marco Rubio  would be a good team.﻿
z120sbeays2tzbevu22rz3bygvnlhpqdq, 2015-09-25T04:34:49.960Z, Thin skinned Trump can't handle the slightest criticism. How can he handle  dealing with Putin and all the other threats and tough decisions that comes  with foreign policy? Donald "neanderthal" Trump has no chance of getting  elected. Go back to filing bankruptcy.﻿

z13dfhy43vzvwlnw404ccfsxsymbingxhs40k, 2015-09-21T03:10:54.826Z, Rubio was very impressive in the 2nd debate. People are talking about  Fiorina because she grilled on Trump, but Rubio made strong points of his  own merit and elevated above the nitpicking Fiorina indulged in. He put  himself on the radar big time. Trump vs. Rubio, I don't think Fiorina has a  chance and I don't think Carson has the leadership ability to have a real  chance.﻿
z13pvtpqkyisuty4p04ccfpr1ze4wt4bh30, 2015-09-20T22:17:04.990Z, I think the debate winning order was Rubio, Fiorina, Christie, Cruz, Bush,  Trump, Carson, Paul, Huckabee, Kaisch,  and Walker .... does anyone else  have an opinion???﻿
z135ztnavnzjfhpyk04cfr2bvzvftxexsaw, 2015-09-20T13:55:08.008Z, Bush and Rubio are the dynamic duo!﻿
z13xxxqxttn0xr5qy04chbkbhpmazphxdic, 2015-09-19T22:31:37.568Z, i like Trump but being completely honest he definitely did not win that  debate. i actually think he did pretty poorly but people have trouble  putting aside emotions. i think fiorina, rubio and cruz did the best. hard  to say who won it. id probably say fiorina won.﻿
z12qvlhanknzehplp22six2gyxamurzem, 2015-09-19T22:17:46.960Z, Rubio voted against his own immigration bill. Actually, the GOP loves  illegal workers bc they work for Mexican wages - they even have Walker who  wants Americans to work for pesos, too. Wanna be a serf? Then, vote  Republican.﻿

z13ewzdytxniy13zt04cdj44dvvkhlf5ohg, 2015-09-19T21:42:21.559Z, Poor Marco Rubio.  He seems snake bitten by awkward moments on camera. This time it was his  earpiece + that weird facial expression at the end.  Too funny.﻿
z13qfbs52xutfrgun22ashnb1ua4gljfh, 2015-09-19T13:03:40.300Z, Krauthammer's Zionist agenda is always so apparent. "weak on Iran" from him means: Not pandering to the Supremacists in TelAviv. Rubio is exactly the sort of controllable politician that the Zios want to  groom for the Presidency. He will make a great puppet they think.﻿

z13gtpwossehdfpva22xchbhzrncutmwk04, 2015-09-19T03:51:33.686Z, People who hated Donald Trump :  1) Obama voters who never apologized.  2) Illegals getting all the free stuff: Driver license and superb medical  care.  3) Losers 4) Corporations taking jobs overseas. 5) Free loaders. Welfare recipients who owns a brand new BMWs.  6) Democrat Party Chronic liars who would sell America to the highest  bidders.﻿

z12czdhgcxyvthwwm04cidazmrbwenbrcq00k, 2015-09-18T15:18:01.560Z, I think Rubio wants to be president so bad he would say or do anything!  Anything! Even go to Israel and lick Netanyahu's boots, or whatever if that  is what it takes. Shame on you and others like you! You and maybe all but  three people debating a day ago should RUN off that stage!! The two doctors  can stay and John Kavich. Hopefully voters can see past the mainstream  media!﻿
z12uzfzr1m3xjd0vi23mdrwptz2otxu5k04, 2015-09-18T15:11:34.721Z, Rubio you are full of crap. You and the rest are making this a political  football. You are not the measure of a statesman and good American.' Do  what's best for America!!!!!' The experts know this is a reasonable deal  and most of the civilized people of other countries do too! Even the  majority of Jews thinks this deal is good!﻿
z12euzkq2xraeh4ei23mdrwptz2otxu5k04, 2015-09-18T15:03:44.453Z, Rubio needs to just go to Israel and lick Netanyahus boots till his tongue  falls off!﻿
z12rwlladyubgxpve23tuhz5evytf5emy, 2015-09-18T11:55:47.226Z, I gave Rubio and Bush the win. What I learned is that the GOP has a lot of  serious candidates. I think it will come down to Bush, Walker, Kasich, or  Trump.﻿

z13led2bxnbnepcg404ccxr4pyn1yfvr4f4, 2015-09-18T05:47:29.468Z, CNN and the RNC want Trump,Cruz,Walker to get dropped. That's why they not  only agreed to control the debate, they wanted to instigate arguing among  the candidates so they couldn't discuss solutions to the destructive forces  ruining our country. Fiorina jumped right on the Hillary bandwagon trying  to portray Trump as a misogynist. Fiorina, Bush, Rubio, Huckster, Kasich,  and Christie should be elbowed out back to their ass kissing underworld  they crawled out of.﻿
z134d51akxyrdncar04cjpqh5qjpep5xkw40k, 2015-09-17T23:52:09.828Z, Man he did an amazing job during the debate but he is too against  Marijuana. Why are you against Marijuana when everyone knows its harmless?  Its not 1950 anymore and the republicans need to realize this if they want  to pull in the younger voters. Rubio would be great if he eased up on some  of his policies like Marijuana and other dumb shit.﻿

z12rh5yawtuqhj5wi04cjblwkxywfjoblws0k, 2015-09-17T07:42:51.997Z, Fox defends Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio all the establishment ,  pro-amnesty, RINO traitors.  Then Fox attacks all the principled outsiders, Trump, Carson (this  surprised me because I thought Carson did well and I'm a Trump fan so it  exposes Krauthammer for his phony establishment views), and a backhanded  compliment to Rand, but then goes on to compliment Christie's pathetic  night. Christie did NOT look good...﻿

z13pwv4adxefutosk224zl2jhwfmdvcrl04, 2015-09-17T05:49:05.644Z, Rove: "I think Rubio did well AGAIN" Pay attention to the "again" term, everyone. Rubio TANKED after the first  debate. Also, how can Rove be objective grading a guy who just called him a "jerk"?  Seriously? Recuse yourself﻿
z12lv5obowv4yhhyn04chxl45y3fgffxp3w, 2015-09-17T05:46:47.919Z, I agree the format was unfortunate. Poor Carson looked appauled and it's  not his thing to get down in the mud, he has too much class, so this was  unlucky for him. I was especially impressed with Fiorina and I thought  Rubio was studied and composed. Christy did not dissapoint, I expected him  to lean in and he did. The first debate hosted by Fox was much better. Mr  Krauthammer's analysis was exactly what I came away with as well.﻿

z132xbaifu22uxwje04cddjysu2btfoqp4g, 2015-09-08T19:21:45.444Z, AMAZING that Fox and CNN are trying to manipulate who the presidential  candidates are going to be. You push trump in the morning and bush in the  evening with a dash of rubio, fiorina and now carson yet hardly report on  Cruz who is rising when people hear him.

I just don't see that with Ben Carson.﻿

Carson, Kasich,  Bush, Rubio, Paul, Christie, Cruz, Walker, Huckabee and the all mighty  Trump, don't have a chance against Hillary.﻿

z12zsf3x1uazuxkgz04cj3vomnreutvial00k, 2015-08-29T15:11:46.732Z, So far Rubio has my vote. Remember that most people don't vote for what  they hear. They vote for how the person presents them self and looks. Obama, Reagan, Clinton, JFK, for example. Im not saying thats right, but Hillary wouldn't have a $600 hair style if  her looks didnt matter.﻿

z12le1vqdtqrcflcj23bzx5onzu1ttv2z, 2015-08-26T18:07:08.860Z, No idea why they keep pretending that the founding fathers didn't support  "illegal" immigration. There was no such thing as illegal immigration at  the time. The founding fathers completely supported immigration. That  doesn't mean we should open the border, but stop using the founding fathers  in an argument against illegal immigration. It's a ridiculous claim. The  14th amendment has existed since before any restrictions on immigration. It  means exactly what it says.﻿

z12pid4qdkaxjd0yt04cephhuwrfinrz0n40k, 2015-08-21T13:20:18.479Z, Holy cow - a Republican with common sense. In THIS interview he's actually  thinking, not jumping to conclusions and trying to think with a clear mind  rather than seeing red (i.e. anger). Do not necessarily agree with his tax  policy at the end, but he is 100% correct about education. As an  independent, I will say there is hope for the Republican side. He almost  has my vote.﻿

Even though his political plan for the nation is really no different from  any Right wing republican, his attitude and demeanor isn't one deserving of  our highest office.

z12lwhejxpakc35ry04cfhjyoliieljhkx00k, 2015-08-08T06:23:31.442Z, its ridiculous how Fox News only emphasize that Rubio and Kasich "Stood  out" and put up a good debate, when all these other polls including drudge  report show the majority thought Trump won the debate. ﻿
z13bw3vavkrjuxsbe04chjtigxr2w3vgwhk, 2015-08-08T04:50:30.176Z, This guy would beat any democratic . Luckily for the democrats the far  rightwing will never let him be the nominee .﻿
z12fu1jplqb3xruzh04cf1w4czuzt1pxp2s, 2015-08-08T04:49:48.636Z, War on women is getting old. How about war on babies? I think that is more  appropriate. They have no defense, and they're being murdered. It's  barbaric just like Rubio said!﻿
z12ny1sbezqjerhs222od3dxqteodjusl, 2015-08-08T02:27:15.497Z, Crossing my fingers for Carson, Rubio, Walker or Bush.﻿

z13nhfwa0lq5s3tig04cfdxggmuzdvvijy40k, 2015-08-08T01:35:40.607Z, He forgot to mention that lots of Cubans also cross the borders from Mexico  and Canada ILLEGALLY .. And also that they get all the freebees benefits  that other foreigners do not get. And yes they get advantage as well and  abuse the system too ... Hello SR RUBIO ( MR BLOND ) double standard﻿
z12jdfqixkqlsjie5222ivfbvwbqybwjs04, 2015-08-07T22:48:46.433Z, Marco Rubio is ...mentally challenged?﻿
z12pxlsx3qqiizpxb04cj5qwhsmvstvxl4w, 2015-08-07T19:57:33.511Z, People always talk about "left wing conspiracies", but last night the way  they went after trump was clearly a right wing conspiracy! The moderators  were put up to this. Can any Republican still cry about Crowley when this  goes on in their own party? There is also NO chance that any moderator in  the national Presidential debates would levy crude attack after attack  against one candidate. Fox has always had an agenda and Trump is clearly  not part of that agenda. ﻿
z13rx5sbzw2nczdhe04cit5inwnpdpnohwc0k, 2015-08-07T19:15:20.124Z, Donald Trump straight up said stop bitching about your feelings there are  more important things in this world. ﻿
z12ssvaigs2ms523t22uw1i4aki2z5wta, 2015-08-07T19:13:17.297Z, Christie, "let's keep doing what got us in this pickle in the first place".  Go Rand. I agree with you more than any of the others up on that stage.  BTW, who really trusts Marco Rubio and these other guys? Go look up their  voting records please people.﻿
z12dvn0win2sx54rk04cdbbwlnzittkimqo0k, 2015-08-07T18:52:08.260Z, I agree with what Rubio said that in the case of rape why solve a tragedy  with death, even if the unborn child doesn't feel pain you can't just quit  on a helpless human being without giving it a chance to grow up. I support  those people who save the lives of babies at abortion clinics. How is that  a bad thing?﻿
z13ddtc5kom5yj3bj04cevlyxqjbcvjzcgc, 2015-08-07T18:46:29.145Z, Does anyone see the irony in that statement? "This country needs a brain"  Not only does Trump not have one larger than a yeast cell, but neither does  anyone else in the room.﻿
z12cudrydwauwn31i22kg1nwns3zv3qtq, 2015-08-07T18:22:33.221Z, Jeb pretends he doesn't know that the Real republicans want higher  standards too....for their children in privately owned schools but not for  everyone. Marco Rubio thinks that he has something to say! He better cool  down with that bullsh#*t before he finds out that he is a 3rd class citizen  and can never be president!﻿
z12dclkqru21d3rmf22yxhwqss3ggvk1r, 2015-08-07T18:02:32.823Z, shame on is floridians these 2 bush and rubio are talking for us. the rest  of US will think we all are a bunch of ignorant non sensical stupid idiots﻿

z13utxsb0tv5hxfb104chhpglzzpej2qumk0k, 2015-08-07T17:58:45.865Z, In other words, Marco Rubio supports rape.﻿
z125d3pylsvbtxq3e23ugdeylyybfn1k1, 2015-08-07T17:58:40.410Z, Trump was being given ridiculous questions all night long. Most of them  pertained to his past. How can you expect him to give specifics on issues  when you don't ask him questions on specific issues??﻿
z12fv34xgyugf1m0v23iwp1xnlabyhbyn04, 2015-08-07T17:55:03.249Z, 🇺🇸🎉TED CRUZ/DONALD TRUMP 2016!🎉🇺🇸﻿
z13xxb24gvjfvvrbu04cg10qgyr2xlmqoq40k, 2015-08-07T17:19:01.865Z, TRUMP/ RUBIO / CARSON /  BUSH / FORLORINA   Yes, Trump the President with Rubio, Carson, Bush and Forlorina as the Vice  Presidents.  Theres no rule about how many Vie presidents the Nation can  have.    This would represent the People the Most.     Alot more than that ugly  whore clinton, she doesn't represent the people at all.﻿

z13tf1m4rsq5vjugc04ced05gpzjxriijco, 2015-08-07T15:32:29.939Z, The candidates who I really have faith in are Ben Carson, Marco Rubio,  Scott Walker, and Rand Paul. I would love to see any of them in office! The  rest of the Republican field is... No bueno ﻿
z12usvejlqvhiz0x004cgvdwgyahgxuq5hk, 2015-08-07T14:56:59.290Z, I'm pretty liberal and I disagree with the Republican candidates on a lot  of issues. That said, I actually like Fiorina and Rubio. If it came down to  Clinton or Sanders vs Fiorina or Rubio, I wouldn't be so disappointed. If  any of the others get the Republican nomination ... I'd be concerned, to  say the least. I'm also a bit concerned about Hillary, but that's a  different issue altogether.﻿
z132zppzgsbgdnggj04cg1mqvsj5vls5nxw0k, 2015-08-07T14:23:02.959Z, Carson would be a great contender for President. However, he is facing an  uphill battle because he is black and a Republican. Race will always be an  issue in our country. Republicans agree with his point of views, but will  never vote for him because of his race and minorities will not vote for him  because he is a Republican and he constantly bashes our President who  happens to be black. I'm just saying what most people think, but will not  admit.﻿
z13sxbziznf2xfl0q22pi5hrllrvipstp, 2015-08-07T14:08:41.693Z, Marco Rubio is an elf !! I mean look those ears!﻿
z12gwlzx2vabehr1t23oi12hnovtfndho04, 2015-08-07T14:00:43.161Z, Am I the only one who felt like throughout the entire debate fox was trying  to limit rand's air time? He got the lead amount of time on the mic, every  Fox News analyst said he lost this argument with Christie, yet everybody  outside of Fox News said Rand won. He also wasn't on hannity's show after  the debate, when I believe EVERY single other candidate in the debate was﻿
z13nthchflmddzurn04cfzqomnnusptiswg0k, 2015-08-07T13:49:56.533Z, Rubio is the only presidential and realistic candidate.﻿
z12efdxxosmod1beg22ngrphoyftcfrub, 2015-08-07T13:00:32.476Z, Carson, Huckabee and Rubio all did well.   Fox and Bret Bair disappoints  with opening question aimed a only one guy, with only one answer and for  only one reason.﻿
z125ffhrvvu2ypfeh221dzwymyfgiho2v, 2015-08-07T10:46:06.045Z, Marco Rubio has done fuck all in his life; he basically went from  university to politics and has no experience running anything. His water  break is the only memorable thing he's ever done. He never says anything  remotely interesting; just regurgitating whatever the current Republican  talking points are. It beggars belief why anyone thinks he is Presidential  material.﻿
z12ifl15euijxb1qr04cdvqb1sjbgvu5z54, 2015-08-07T09:33:39.457Z, Trump 2016, get fukt nerds﻿
z121xrtz1vv3u1zm123zutziap2ov5yvd, 2015-08-07T09:27:18.031Z, The Republicans should support abortions and birth controls so that mean  less poor people being born so less welfare money wasted, and the illegals  should have abortion too since they're overbreeding and cause the city to  be in poverty.﻿

z135ijpxdnumwdudn23otfogypvndt0ds, 2015-08-07T05:42:42.446Z, He never answered the actual question.  That was just a stupid word salad.   He attacked Obama, delivered some doom and gloom prophecy and people  clapped.   Is this really what you want in a leader???  He was asked How he would handle it.  Because he has ZERO clue about actual  Foreign Policy he couldn't answer that question.  You really want this  moron near a nuke?﻿

He  understands living out of entitlement from his parents, despite growing up  wealthy. However, like him, I grew up well off in the upper middle class  but I have learned so much about the true American Dream and what it means  to have genuine integrity just from learning from my parents. Marco Rubio  is the man I want in office. He understands things on the basis that I  coexist on as well. ﻿

If we want to beat Hillary we have to pull  in independents. We can not do that with a hard core conservative. Our best  bet is Rubio. They are afraid of him ! He has good values , a great story,  & it is time to elect a younger man. They have to live in the mess the  older generation has made. By the way, I am not young!﻿

z12isnviywvqvrebc04cgnezqxu2h5whkh0, 2015-03-11T13:48:04.716Z, Fellow Tubers,  Sen. Marco Rubio(R-FL) would not run for president if the money is not  there.    His message does not count, which is what he, and others, are saying.  Sen. Rubio can not think for  himself, obviously, otherwise his message would instantly gain popular support.   It is not a message, but funding a  lie.  It be it, Ronin Kannushi﻿
z12psnjoqzyggfovc22ix5kjbpnfc5al2, 2015-02-14T05:26:53.865Z, Rubio doesn't have a chance in hell in becoming the nominee. All other  stations will promote the Republican candidate that has the lowest chance  of winning against a Democrat. That's what they seem to always do. Like  Romney, or even McCain. They loved McCain during the primaries, but during  the general election, they destroyed him and it was easy because McCain was  the wimpiest GOP candidate at the time.﻿

z13tene5orjuxnf3c23fxzvjanuug5swc04, 2015-11-26T19:12:30.190Z, Only conservatives can be stupid enough to run a giant fucking asshole in  the primary and expect him to garner votes outside the right-wing asshole  base.   And they equate being an ignorant asshole with being anti-PC, like it's a  badge of honor.   As stupid as you thought these people were running Romney four years ago  they've proven they're ready to top that level of stupidity by running this  loudmouth douchebag.﻿
z13nw53y0ojidtl4g04cj3mj5uasw5cobc4, 2015-11-26T16:52:03.749Z, Everybody should care about this.  It's a very real possibility that this man could become the next president.  There are thousands of sheep in America.  Thankfully I'm British, so Trump becoming president would only have a minor  affect on me.  If this the man who you really want to run your country? You truly have to  question his intelligence and empathy when he does shit like this.  It's a shame.﻿
z12qghv5kuips1hvy22qszx4infkfh5xc04, 2015-11-26T10:20:20.421Z, Trump and Carson are on their way out. The establishment GOP has announced  theyre launching anti-kook ads. They won't stand by and let the kooks  destroy the GOP brand. Trump will get pissed off and go independent  (remember Ross Perot?). With a 3-way general election....Hillary easily  takes all the chips. Teabillies commit suicide. All is good.﻿
z131hduoqvmktbgqi04cj3zgtx2dfzmanf0, 2015-11-26T04:32:00.361Z, Daily reminder that nobody cares about this. Trump's numbers will continue  to rise at the same rate that the anti-Trump pieces are peddled out by the  media. Thankfully, nobody is listening anymore.﻿
z13pfryyzzvivtj4104ch1kytwe1znninfw, 2015-11-26T03:22:44.126Z, That wasn't very nice trump but given your the only one that can make  America great I will give you a pass on it!!!﻿

z13cefyqznyoupoqm04ch1ti1xuudnsxnko0k, 2015-11-24T21:55:22.437Z, It's odd why they would shoot down a russian aircraft when they know they  are fighting ISIS﻿
z13xibp5utbpfz0sv23fip2pwz3yfnjan04, 2015-11-24T13:55:07.891Z, Sanders is atheist and socialist. Only 48% of americans would vote for him.  The only way he could win is if the democrat coalition turnout outperform  the levels of 2008 and 2012.   As a conservative, I apreciate Sanders as person, he really believe in his  cause, unlike Hillary. I cheer he gets the nomination because it would be a  gift to the GOP candidate.   Rubio, Kasich, Jeb and Christie would not feel any burn. Trump or Cruz coul  get burned.﻿
z13ehfnxbxa4vrbae04cilry1siadbag02g, 2015-11-24T13:46:42.481Z, There's nothing white conservatives hate more than an articulate black man  who refuses to sell out to their cause.﻿

z12zi33odrfvelr5c04chh2bbyqddhzpopg0k, 2015-11-21T20:34:14.055Z, I liked what Rubio said, hes still a self hating latino though﻿
z124unl5ez3mtjden23ksdcg5nqve1ps4, 2015-11-21T02:42:07.259Z, When it is clear from the Polls that only 4 out of these 9-10 candidates ie  TRUMP, Carson,RuBio & CruZ have the serious chance of winning the race  then I do not understand why rest of the others r keep coming & continuing  when they himself knew that now they can't make it﻿
z130hvrzvy2lcdxto23dzdhpuuvjj14bz04, 2015-11-21T00:55:09.082Z, I like Rubio and Rand.﻿
z13egfiwksquy32n423udtginujeilg2y, 2015-11-19T22:04:35.851Z, Hillary is a hawk. I like that part of her. Islamists are fucked either way  after Mr.Sensitive leaves the White House. It's either Hillary or someone  like Trump or Rubio then. Good fucking luck hahaha!﻿
z12sjfxhakffdzg5m04cdbdpixmhtty4kq40k, 2015-11-18T09:34:54.575Z, Every Trump supporter is a white Supremes rascist tard. You can see it by  the comments like calling this guy kumar. Disgusting nazi fags. Go fuck  your cousins like you imbreads do. No soal no rythm no nothing. Boring ass  culture. Cant wait till pig ugly trump gets beat by a Latino #Rubio ﻿
z13hspxz0urhxhewv04cfvybwlqygfmwrak, 2015-11-18T05:24:10.311Z, It would probably be good if Cruz, Santorum, Rubio and Bush to just drop  out and take their donor money with them.  Not like they stood a real chance against Trump or Carson for the  Republican nomination.﻿
z13vzrchkqyyf3o4504cf5r4gpylg3r41q00k, 2015-11-18T02:37:42.493Z, the electoral college chooses who becomes the president. not the votera﻿

z120jve5qk2nzzde523rflcgbpvxhvm1w, 2015-11-16T12:39:34.626Z, I suppose Marco Rubio is the most evil person on stage. This warmongering  scum would lead America to bankruptcy. Shame on those fucking morons, who  applauded so enthusiastically to his disgusting war propaganda﻿
z13tzhzjjvzqhfei104cdju5qw2vzhrzryk0k, 2015-11-15T05:40:19.849Z, why are we still having the GOP circus one of these 3 is the next president.﻿

z132jtdrssbkgrtom04chtggpkqrxxh5hqo0k, 2015-11-13T18:31:21.755Z, Trump is starting to work on my nerves. We the American people do not want  a fucking clown for a President. I am starting to lean towards voting for  Carson.﻿
z12adbwoure0fh0oa04ce53pfluxup5p11s, 2015-11-13T13:18:22.822Z, Marco Amnesty Rubio is a disgrace. At best he is Paul Ryan's pet project.﻿
z12gthawrzbjsllov04cizcisui3yfgqosw0k, 2015-11-13T07:59:34.783Z, Rubio is wrong this is America you need to speak English. Hypothetically, I  wouldn't move to Japan and expect their politicians to speak English  because thats the language they spoke from my homeland!﻿
z12ruxahsmy3eztqs04cdbdpixmhtty4kq40k, 2015-11-13T07:23:59.408Z, Lets kick all the whites out. Starting with trump. Go Rubio!!! Si se  puede!!!﻿

z13ms3trslqvifaod04cjl54cumkwtj5mvs0k, 2015-11-13T00:06:45.328Z, Rubio does not know the meaning of the world isolationist. He is far more  isolationist than Paul, because he favors draconian sanctions and  blockades.﻿
z12wjjri5tyejbduv22esf0qhwykulocc, 2015-11-12T22:17:40.152Z, Rubio does not understand how business works.  And he wants to be President  maybe just like Obama who has not had business savvy either as evidenced by  the most recent Iran deal quarterbacked by John Kerry.  Rubio has no clue  that filing bankrupt on a business is not the same as filing personal.  I  like Rubio but he's still a kid....﻿
z13zgpji2wmygfa0j23rutf5sqfvibnws04, 2015-11-12T21:44:05.735Z, just in case everyone doesn't understand what Marco Rubio is doing he is  intentionally muddying the waters to make it tougher for the voting  constituencies to be able to tell the difference between himself and Ted  Cruz but as I said we all know who's the conservative and who is the  liberal Republican Marco Rubio is jeb Bush's boy he's his conservative  blocker﻿
z12ywrniovrdvxivq23rutf5sqfvibnws04, 2015-11-12T21:42:56.236Z, Marco Rubio is a liar and a moderate Republican at best I think we all know  the true conservative it's Ted Cruz Ted Cruz 2016﻿
z12kf5ogpovxgfa4p04cizf5gr2tjhsyjn00k, 2015-11-12T21:39:34.153Z, once again CNN you have failed to surprise me by having a liberal Democrat  like good old rat face. Rat face will be a big fan of Marco Rubio the  reason she is a supporter of Hillary Clinton she knows that Marco Rubio  will be easily beaten by Hillary Clinton Ted Cruz will be much much tougher  for Hillary to beat so she will support Marco Rubio as the easier candidate  to be and suggests that Ted Cruz is a crazy whack job who's going to kill  us all﻿
z13pftfqvoaxjhwsb23rutf5sqfvibnws04, 2015-11-12T21:37:07.268Z, Rubio in Cruz agree on "legal" immigration. also Rubio seeing the mood of  the voter is trying to be more like Cruz not the other way around Rubio is  the new standard bearer for the moderates now that Jeb Bush is no longer  viable as a presidential candidate. the truth is if you want to Linguini's  find moderate to liberal Republican Marco Rubio's your man if you want a  hardcore real conservative Ted Cruz your man Ted Cruz 2016 Ted Cruz. Org  Ted Cruz. org﻿
z122slu50oiqz1vrz04cjrihbs2ldjaw5oc0k, 2015-11-12T14:28:41.487Z, Marco Rubio is right about welders making more than philosophy majors I'm a  welder I make 93,000 dollars a year........so cnn check your facts bullshit  news organization....﻿
z133hf0qplzgez2h304cfpgigpngdbjz3wc0k, 2015-11-12T04:43:50.112Z, CRUZ, CARSON, and RUBIO are Israel firster far right AIPAC JSTREET puppets.  Ru Paul is PRO TPP. CARSON is out of his mind. Not an ounce of sincerity  from all of them combined. Just vacant slogans from corporate whores.  Shallow and corrupt. Grotesque.﻿
z12uc5v5ptzezpowz04cjdawlmnvsv1gomg0k, 2015-11-12T00:13:19.591Z, PAUL REPRESENTS *REAL CONSERVATISM.* Rubio's a fake, cultural conservative  telling us that Radical Jihadist in the Middle East require us to DESTROY  THE CURRENCY WITH DEBT.  And no, Rubio, you're the isolationist who won't talk or trade with Cuba,  Russia, and China.﻿
z121ehnavmrqhv2tb230cnfpivnjsh3bp04, 2015-11-11T23:25:44.661Z, Only in people that have a chance against Hilary is Trump, Carson and Rubio Why? because they are exciting and US likes that. If Paul, Cruz or Kasich  get the nomination you might as well give the presidency to Hilary Clinton  because they don't stand a blue chance in hell to beat Hilary﻿
z13jgv2w0umeet2yz04cgnzbqmrnhxgjvms0k, 2015-11-11T23:17:13.733Z, Manipulation reporting. Trump never said Operation wetback. Only Cnn would  distort the true facts to brain wash people's opinions.﻿
z125izmjfyfmzbmxl04cg12hipvihz1ogyo0k, 2015-11-11T23:09:05.647Z, Let's be real the only ones that has a chance against Hilary has to be  exciting or charismatic. Americans like that, they don't like boring and  the same song and dance. Their are only 3 candidates in Republican party  that have a slight chance. They are Carson, Rubio and Trump and even against Hilary they will all be  underdog's﻿
z13kyxljrkqqdzh2r23jil1zvvmgdliwp04, 2015-11-11T23:07:08.872Z, Shame on Trump? Nah I'm beyond that now. Shame on neocons who continue to  place him that high in the polls so we have to listen this stuff﻿
z131dr45puivzjrcs233ypgawp2rvnq1t, 2015-11-11T22:11:46.779Z, Paul 1 Rubio 0﻿
z13pfha41ob1dxatl23ix1oqvyifhfi3h, 2015-11-11T21:31:07.476Z, notice, when Rubio is cornered he starts acting up with emotional fears,  but he didn't answer Rands questions...﻿
z13pc5dgmx24zt4a204chvoamvjtthphsho, 2015-11-11T21:28:23.033Z, scrolling down the comments, everyone seems to be amazed with Paul. Unlike  the media, they're determined Rubio came out the victor from all... how  biased and false... I'm positive Rand is gonna have a knockout when  election nears﻿
z123svgzoyjgz3frn04chnfbrujnyhmhbdo, 2015-11-11T20:51:18.421Z, Rubio is an empty suit like Obama.  He has done nothing.  A welfare plan  that gives more money to low income families who keep pumping out  children-  sounds more like a democratic tax plan than a conservative one.﻿
z13jibkhmlegz5raj04ccrwbxobpfpjya04, 2015-11-11T20:01:41.191Z, Rubio sounds like an overly emotional woman.﻿
z12qhpfzayzkuzxdi22ai3nbbo3dugyc, 2015-11-11T19:32:03.246Z, Holy cow, I just read the article that I referred to earlier. The two  Pinocchio that were granted in regards to Hilary's lie were for Rubio, for  his Statement that Hilary lied. . Not to hillary for actually lying to the  American people and to the families in person. Hilary is the Gift that  keeps on giving. If the reporting were exclusively about her there would  not even be room for the weather.﻿

z12pjbpjyk3bsbxse23ystiysqmtthcjj04, 2015-11-11T13:45:39.115Z, Voting for Rand Paul in the primaries and suggest you all do the same.  We  already have the strongest military in the world, both strategically and  tactically and can annihilate the planet THOUSANDS of times over - DO NOT  let the "masters of war" who only seek to line their pockets scare you into  spending us further into oblivion!  Rand is right: there IS a much wiser,  better path for the USA that will restore true security and improved  foreign relations.   Rand Paul 2016.﻿
z13jhrxhosawhpg4j04cf1mzrv2idt2g4js, 2015-11-11T13:39:59.948Z, Rubio is right China is going to have a population boom and they're going  to need more resources. They're already taking over Africa and they like  them better. Those applauding Rand are delusional to think you're safer  with a weaker military﻿
z13ihbugdz3sdfdlo23ecbkrymiwsle1f, 2015-11-11T12:50:12.892Z, Look at all those Republican morons in the audience applaud Rubio's  nonsense. America is already the strongest military nation in the world,  you drones. You don't have to spend extra 1 trillion dollars. We already  spend more than the next 10 countries combined.﻿

z13ms3xh1knehx4fw22mzhehllquvh5kc, 2015-11-11T04:37:27.148Z, Rand is pretty much always right.﻿
z13vyhlyuuyient2x23ccldhtzvlixghz04, 2015-11-11T04:12:45.717Z, Shiiiieeeetttt, a guy like Rubio is running for President? I might as well  just tell my friend to un-naturalize to not become an American citizen,  because this country is going down hill quickly with these filthy  politicians siding with the industrial military complex. It will probably  take another World War to get this fucked up nation straightened up. God  bless America.﻿
z12csp2xjuvcfpczn04cgdo5tujyybq4a2g, 2015-11-10T19:37:22.892Z, According to Rubio, deporting 11 million Hispanic ILLEGALS DOESN'T MAKE  "NO" SENSE. What he's really saying is that letting all ILLEGALS stay makes  perfect sense. Typical half-wit pandering politician, who appeals to  emotions but not reason and worse, the rule of law, and the constitution.﻿

z121wx24us3tstte123owduwsvi4x1xps04, 2015-11-08T18:09:42.088Z, Fair enough, Rand. But if you get to claim that Marco Rubio and Hillary  Clinton share the same neoconservative philosophy, then it's fair game to  to point out that Rand Paul and Ron Paul share the same neo-Confederate  philosophy and isolationist impulse.﻿
z13hwtvhikfxhl0i204ccpzrjv3jt5qyxgc, 2015-11-08T17:36:55.025Z, this pot smoking millennial iraq veteran is supporting paul I'm no teabag  get and am quite educated and I'm an agnostic person, we should vote on the  bases of who would do the best on the majority of issues not who is the  best on single issues﻿
z12gxbnqdze1vxqke230z5ixbzywgh11k, 2015-11-08T12:47:23.070Z, Well, at least we now know why Rubio wants to be President of the USA. He  needs the money.﻿
z12offzwwsjrtzl2n22zw5mj5ljxyb3kt, 2015-11-08T05:10:33.339Z, Why do I feel like Rubio is getting a check from American Express for this  publicity.﻿
z13fjhjraomatruio04cib0i0prsgnoqtzg0k, 2015-11-08T01:48:41.645Z, i cannot trust Rubio because some of his policies are  similar to s Obama's  agenda.  I did not see Rubio to call mitch Mconnel a liar.  You failed to  stick up for the American people and  let Obama get his own way.  He is a  puppet and he should not be trusted.﻿
z13oe1kgrqb1zv3w504cebn5zku2y1ajjcw, 2015-11-07T22:57:13.572Z, Until recently, I was blind to mainstream media bias that exists in  America. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were right. Thank you CNN and thank you  Politico for exposing your true colors to us.﻿
z12pjds4tm2pcziqr04cdrlx0wadgtwrgk00k, 2015-11-07T22:50:26.393Z, if this fucking idiot cant even take care of his finances, then how the  fuck is he going to take care of america's finances?? he would make a  terrible president for many reasons.﻿
z12fttlg2tnocbaa304cizhrczv0fbgynmo0k, 2015-11-07T22:21:23.503Z, If you're black and not a liberal, this happens.﻿
z13id5jgrk2hg1y1x22nj5vb5ormefpnn, 2015-11-07T15:34:14.206Z, Fiorina has that 'vocal fry' thing going around these days: highly  annoying. Also, we mock the men too: Trump's hair, Rubio's dry mouth and  elephant ears, Cruz's melting face, etc. If woman want to get in the ring,  they also have to be ready to take a few hits and roll with it.﻿
z131gh3anyanhtbrx04cfvdydzy4fdhovbg, 2015-11-07T03:45:26.359Z, Ben putting the media in their place! Holy shit i love this guy!!﻿

z12keb3bsvryixovr23oebjjpkuyjhmun, 2015-11-07T00:59:37.318Z, He will never be president.﻿
z134wruiglv3ffxqu04cipmbjlb5yf0o0hc, 2015-11-07T00:57:35.334Z, Carson is done. Either Trump, Cruz, or Rubio now. My bet is on Trump winning the nomination and then losing the election in  an absolutely abysmal defeat.﻿
z13ushpy3yyys1yhw04cftzqmna1ult4nnc0k, 2015-11-06T19:06:31.107Z, Obama is pretty much  guaranteeing a Republican win.﻿
z12iu52z3m25gzgtk22ptlgokse2gdn2j, 2015-11-06T19:01:43.785Z, One RINO (Trump), two moderate republicans who would fold under pressure  (Carson and Rubio) and one candidate who advocates capitalism, rejects the  fake old-Nazi dogma about a "behavioral gene", and exposed Sierra Club's  global warming arguments as a fraud (Ted Cruz.)﻿
z134dtebfpvfs1ykg223dr2jftyofzcqw04, 2015-11-06T17:41:04.894Z, republicans are racist﻿

z12ke3x4zt3nv30cr22ucp34nnjlvtlhc04, 2015-11-06T14:56:56.769Z, I'm so tired of gotcha journalism. CNN gave Obama a pass. They never  scrutinized his record. They worshipped him. But not a Republican like  Carson. They make me sick.﻿
z131udzhkrjxtn5sa23wepuqnzmwtfihy04, 2015-11-06T14:23:38.412Z, This guy is a joke. Answer a single simple question. Dude is so full of  shit.﻿
z12bstcjmwfhznvas04cc33xjovsj1jhdf4, 2015-11-06T08:54:25.861Z, He was the one misbehaving . Why would he be "exposing "  them ? As people  start to look more closely at the candidates we will see more and more  cracks in their armour .This is a good thing .Example: We now know that  Rubio can`t look after his own finances .﻿
z122idsgbki0jlirm04cctf4opnhhbdjols0k, 2015-11-05T18:06:55.368Z, nice try rubio...come back and run when you are 30 years older﻿
z122tpgwtsj2cnbqq04ccvow2svrfbl4mqk0k, 2015-11-05T17:47:37.277Z, Holy crap that adds up to $225.68 !! I wonder if he can pay it back.﻿
z12ufpoazuiqsfoct22cxrxxloekgdozn04, 2015-11-05T17:42:24.291Z, How can a seemingly bright, fairly young fellow like Mr. Rubio have his  head up his ass about the environment? I am not surprised at the other denying Republican tools, but I thought  Rubio might be more intelligent and honest. Apparently he will suck the big donor/big corporation tit and ignore the  threat to our grandchildren just like the others.﻿
z12wi5ozdzjmspd5k04cgx5xcyywxxairyk0k, 2015-11-05T13:27:11.107Z, Marco Rubio is Co-Sponsor of the pro-outsourcing I-squared bill that would  send thousands of US jobs to India. He would triple the number of H-1B  visas used to bring in Indian workers who are then trained by the American  workers they are replacing. The American worker is then laid off and the  foreign worker goes back to India, taking the job with him.﻿
z12lgjnwvmbwjbspr04cgr455vj1xhfzl50, 2015-11-04T20:33:43.323Z, Donald trump is a pure and utter jackass. The guy has not got a clue. He  attracts big crowds because he is a clown. Looking at this from Ireland,  and he is giving us great laughs.﻿
z12gg52jsmetftdrs04cjrmilvmpdx0a03w, 2015-11-04T18:01:27.498Z, Yeah, it will resonate; like a fly trapped underneath a glass container  buzzz - ping! - buzzz - ping! Buzzzz - ping!!!!!!! Marco ' Buzzz - ping!'  Rubio. lol ffs﻿
z125ifdbsryuct1bm04cgxeglvijgznzjpw0k, 2015-11-04T18:00:43.108Z, Rubio seems a nice guy but he is not what we need. Trump or Carson for me.﻿
z12tzrsapoq1gvhnp22vjz4aaualy5ssq, 2015-11-04T13:31:58.194Z, This guy is a liberal tool for CNN. Always trying to discredit Donald Trump  and never criticizes the other candidates. There is nothing Donald Trump  has stated that isn't true about the other candidates. The corrupt media is  on the attack and the people need to wake up to their lies.﻿
z12tdzqzvyjfzpl1d22edrvwewz1xziyn04, 2015-11-04T13:13:33.668Z, Terrible moderator. Trump trump trump Rubio Rubio. Atleast Jeb praised Rand﻿
z133t3pyeziftpyjr04cep3ploausvipymo0k, 2015-11-04T11:06:25.193Z, Ford was a moron.... in the great republican tradition: like Reagan, Dan  Quayle, Sarah Palin, George W Bush, Huckabee, Michelle Bachmann, Scott  Wallace, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz, etc. etc. (shit there are too many to name)﻿
z13furbg3pnkzzyxl04cdfkhqtbwcj4rpgk, 2015-11-04T06:26:17.236Z, Mitt Romney has now been proven to be right about this country and Russia.I  like Romney however we have others who are running that will beat Hillary  like , Rubio, Trump and Cruz.﻿
z13kyd5z0pqizbfdy23wdd2aoobaftgqy04, 2015-11-04T02:41:29.312Z, How did Rubio get the better of anyone? I watched the debate and found  absolutely nothing Rubio said to be even remotely appealing. He just seems  like a huge phony.﻿
z133fvuokpa4g5rdz232tnwafpjwufece, 2015-11-04T02:29:27.245Z, I can confirm that no republican will ever be elected president again. They  can't keep up with social trends and new generation. It's all over for  them.﻿
z12dwj5i5tqbgtkgf04cfv4iinakcj1r4w00k, 2015-11-03T19:24:58.132Z, I used to like trump but lately he's been an idiot. I vote ben carson for  president or rubio. the only thing I agree on trump is we are being led by  idiots. Obama is a fucking moron same with his administration﻿
z12udpugrtmii5iul22evzhxxpiodd30p, 2015-11-03T18:15:57.725Z, Trump protesters all need to put weights in their pockets and walk into the  ocean.  Trump 2016﻿
z12wtrw5um2qfj1u223hizarfu3ixl1n2, 2015-11-03T16:44:36.487Z, If Carson, Trump, Rubio, Bush, or Fiorina were the repub nominee then  Hillary will be president. And im ok with that.﻿
z13khxmi5vv3ctj4004cfpqy4uiazjwiy1c, 2015-11-03T03:22:49.615Z, Super pacs try to destroy Trump. It will be very hard but if they succeed,  you know who will be next ? Carson - and that will be much easier. When  they're done with him, they put their establishment candidate like Rubio.  So let's do everything possible not to let it happen. Keep the good work  ladies and gentlemen!!!﻿
z13uvj4x1vydsdnfl22iidqhjwbwfhnqc04, 2015-11-03T02:42:36.265Z, I saw this poll on RealClearPolitics.  Only 400 were polled for this.  I  don't believe it.﻿

z13rxp14xuu4cxy5004chjfhtlu0g5drqco, 2015-11-02T23:40:52.016Z, George HW Bush in 1990 started a war and we went into a recession with high  unemployment numbers.., Bush Jr. another war and a great recession which is  still not fully recovered after 8 years.. I can't say anything good about  Obama neither.. But brother Bush wants to "Fix It"? The Bushes are known  for destroying the economy and starting wars.. We sure as hell don't need  another BUSH.. Us middle class can't afford this guy... I'd rather see  Trump, Clinton, or Rubio...﻿
z133i5a5xqbkjhrvw23dhztjuxv3e5fgx04, 2015-11-02T23:23:13.087Z, It's all going according to plan. Trump and Carson will exit. Jeb will save  us from Rubio. Who the hell is Rand Paul? Jeb has us right where he wants  us. The only thing missing is Dan Rather. He is missing, I hope. I don't  watch TV, so I don't know.﻿
z133cnw4lxudvfogf04cfvcyhxmpido4skk0k, 2015-11-02T13:33:15.018Z, Bullshit memorized answers from Bush and Rubio. Trump is being practical.﻿
z12dtrm5dnjhcvz5j04cdzzitmvvytq4ydc, 2015-11-02T01:21:39.173Z, Trump is the only presidential candidate that knows what it's all about out  there. The rest are a bunch of spoiled naïve brats. I'm voting for Trump!﻿
z132cf1qdt3bcv43d23he5ta1sfngl1vk, 2015-11-01T21:07:09.128Z, And these crying bitch republicans are the ones who claim they will be  tough on China and Russia!   You cant even handle simple truthful questions about your shitty record  here at home! Putin will eat you alive you sad pathetic losers, now you  want to ban media and censor questions you dont like?  GOP is party of LOSERS! go cry all you like...﻿
z13rstrxat3yg1q3322hwjcb1mfaj5v4004, 2015-11-01T18:59:14.816Z, rubio is a libtard. he should be running as a democratic party candidate.  thats why soo many democraps/libtards like rubio and thats why some  democraps/libtards prefer rubio over their democratic party candidates. the  only reason why rubio ran as a republican for the senate was because most  of the floridians are neo/conservatives. the establishment is libtard.  NEO-conservatives are more libtard than conservative. NEO-conservatives are  slightly to the right libtards.﻿

After  hearing what you said about CNBC pretty much made it clear to me you're a  RINO. For those that are still on the fence with this guy, this might make  things a little more clearer for you..

z12ijdwp2tbif1ffd23jelxhpkewsls4q04, 2015-10-26T06:02:05.105Z, His plan make no sense to you Rubio but it does to a lot of others.  TRUMP 2016!!﻿
z13nhdxxxl32ejcsy23adv04urvpsrlws04, 2015-10-26T05:46:33.949Z, Rubio will loose hands down﻿
z125il1pjkafdlp5w04cdtvbimivz5kiafc, 2015-10-26T04:11:50.456Z, Trump gets ford to move production to Ohio.....Carson and bush go to sleep  as Rubio sweats up a storm as Bernie gives your money away.﻿
z130jrvgcnutx3v3n22iitvonqztg3lmu, 2015-10-26T04:01:14.118Z, Trump gets ford to move production to Ohio.....Start sweating Rubio.﻿
z12adpigtyjlsvqvr22jyrez3mq5u5a0d, 2015-10-26T03:51:34.857Z, great move of jeb bush to turn his guns on ted cruz it was glorious and  changed my opinion on jeb!!!!﻿
z12kzxnopumlw3pm3225hjkjwo3dshlv0, 2015-10-26T03:40:52.057Z, Rubio you suck. We know it and you know it .. just throw in the damn towel  son. Your established party is no longer doable .. we don't want you and  never will again once this country becomes America again we will see that  the esablishment did nothing but hold this country back from its greatness.  FUK the NWO and FUK anyone that supports it! AMERICA DO OR DIE!!! HOORAH!!!﻿
z13se5rzmvj2iruoa04ccppy1zmkhb1qbg0, 2015-10-26T03:32:15.154Z, This is just how corrupt the MSM is. On the whole of all polls Rubio is not  even close to a rise ... I rest my case. They're just scared shiit of Trump  because he is a true American and not part of the corrupt media/gov  establishment ... On the rise my ass! STFU ... I hope the first thing Trump  does as president is shut this corrupt CNN down for good! Along with all  the others! Time reporters start doing what they should be doing. Reporting  TRUTH!!! Not LIES!!!!﻿
z120y31zemnhddgc122jwxxoyvjsjhqtq, 2015-10-26T01:49:58.753Z, Rubio does put a good point out, except, why wouldn't he show up and vote  on each issue, his vote could be the one that makes or breaks an issue. Our  taxes pay for these Politicians and they don't work 40 weeks a year, what's  so hard about showing up for at least 90% of the votes?﻿
z135hjpbeziaxf3yp04cc1wzvkq1sd2pbek, 2015-10-26T01:47:48.296Z, Rubio in the early stages of a comb over someday he'll look like Julio Down by the Schoolyard﻿
z122zlk4zrifvp4eg220jbyw5ki2cpduo, 2015-10-26T01:31:34.928Z, Rubio reminds me of the weird kid who lived down the street﻿
z12rhtwyqlbozpurh04ccj2hzvbmeh2pcfg, 2015-10-26T00:55:06.291Z, So Rubio has stop representing his district﻿
z13qftjz1xrxdd0x104cdxobelruync5sb4, 2015-10-25T19:01:07.066Z, Is he really using his troubled teenage years to prove he is tough? Dude  keep that to yourself or people might start thinking that's why you look so  out of it all the time. Did they give you a lobotomy to calm your crazy  ass? 😆😆😆﻿
z13lfr1hjtzre5mpm04ceh54lvzjgpuipnk0k, 2015-10-25T18:07:26.762Z, Rubio's campaigning like a liberal talking about how he's new, and will be  a different type of candidate, but in fact he's one the the most  ultra-conservative, outdated politicians. He's as conservative as Scott  Walker, especially on economic issues.﻿
z12dddhotsbetzz4r04cibrqktjfibuwuh4, 2015-10-25T18:06:18.574Z, Carson is super low-energy and boring. Representative for the drug  companies. Pro mandatory vaccinations, anti marijuana. No way he gets  elected.﻿
z12hc5fhjzv1etd2g23ysxnhxmrxxhqvk, 2015-10-25T18:00:46.055Z, LOL, CNN trying to use a Trump headline to get likes for Rubio. Nice try!﻿
z12cfv2obru5j5gnu23bd1biapyxwjwwd04, 2015-10-25T17:46:07.277Z, For everyone who didn't really understand what Marco Rubio said? I'll  elaborate... What he ACTUALLY SAID IS? My Dog Ate My Homework... That's why  I don't have it... Yep...﻿
z125dvgholbly5yqr04cgpiw1pyccf4zccc, 2015-10-25T16:48:58.777Z, Bernie sander 2016 fuck trump and Carson﻿
z12efrnpuv3lfvnrz04cgxjwktavcnurdyo0k, 2015-10-25T16:22:51.876Z, No democrat thinks Rubio is scary﻿
z135fptz2kvnvprrq04cfxtzvq2efzzrsy40k, 2015-10-25T16:03:10.445Z, I am ashamed at Rubio. He fails terribly at representating the Hispanic  community. :(﻿
z12xx54bpzrmfxhnq23kh5shswizep401, 2015-10-25T15:20:16.706Z, I really hope Donald Trump wins the Republican Nomination.﻿
z13ds1eqmniyc5u4n04cg3sarqrhxvcaqbc, 2015-10-25T14:02:20.701Z, If rubio dropped out his poll numbers would go to bush. Bush would somehow  win then Rubio would be bushes VP nominee﻿
z12uzzojuyvgs1idy235d1yqvpjrsz1ig04, 2015-10-25T13:38:22.685Z, If Rubio is elected president he might actually beat GWB in the number of  days vacation he takes. GWB took a total of 879 days vacation. GWB, his  first year in office, he took a month long vacation before 9/11. GWB was on  vacation when Hurricane Katrina struck. This is what you're going to get  with Rubio, Jeb Bush, and maybe Donald Trump.  Hillary Clinton was back on the campaign trail the next day after her  11-hour Benghazi testimony. That's commitment. Hillary Clinton 2016﻿
z12ju1oq1tu3ffako22oxhr45sbzgnnif04, 2015-10-25T13:22:07.961Z, I rather Carson than Rubio﻿

z12ks5dgupy4uzmod04cftdhrszyyjfgkm00k, 2015-10-23T15:08:06.361Z, I would like to see a Carson /Rubio or Trump Rubio ticket. I think he's a  little too young for president but I also think he's incredibly smart and  well versed in today's politics and could bring balance and stability to  either of these frontrunners.﻿
z12avpzr3yafspqoe04cdl35pqnetngjvtw0k, 2015-10-23T09:40:36.230Z, Dr.Carson is a good man I would vote for him﻿
z12muzrx1qnxy5ok223lg3qrrxitz5meg, 2015-10-23T08:31:38.466Z, No good. Carson doesn't have the goods to get elected in the general. No  way.﻿
z13vezjhhuicvhd2d23ucblotom3z3ert04, 2015-10-22T00:16:21.421Z, Marco Rubio is fuckin liar. He is clapping, while against immigrants﻿
z13mhztxuurnhby1b23kd51ikqnct3pyj04, 2015-10-19T13:53:56.444Z, Bernie Sanders is old as dirt and looks like hes about to take a fucking  nap.  #MarcoRubio2016﻿
z124i1frtvboxzt0v23guxmjxujtgdfxj04, 2015-10-19T12:21:42.430Z, Trump is crushing Rubio & Bush in their home state. Kristy is not even a  blip on the screen compared to Trump in his home state. What is Mitt Romney  even saying? Such horse shit.﻿
z12ofbaz3kmxtfuiw04chv1j2mffhfmyh1s, 2015-10-19T02:44:56.116Z, "We can laugh at ourselves" so CNN is the media arm of the DNC.﻿
z12sujrjjkadcrcy004cipo4exmdvtf5ges, 2015-10-18T14:15:43.079Z, What about Ben Carson? Cough cough. Haha!!﻿
z12mjtionkukjfrtd23ai5apuwqzyl2kz, 2015-10-17T06:22:17.323Z, Remember CNN is pro Hillary, so they want to prop up the Republican  candidate they feel would be demolished by her. Which of course is Trump.  In actuality, Carson/Rubio/Cruz are probably much closer.﻿
z134dhsawyavub5x504ce3nxawbohz0ofr00k, 2015-10-16T14:25:07.587Z, Trump's a lot of fun, and I support him for upholding the nations' laws and  fighting the tyranny of the Left, but Rubio's speech was genuinely  heart-touching, and I really wish the best for the guy. I can relate. My  grandparents floated to this country from Haiti and Curacao on a door,  respectively, and they're the staunchest conservatives I ever knew. If it  weren't for the Left using welfare schemes to impoverish immigrants and  make them dependents, none of this would be necessary.﻿
z134zbd4vsnhyr1xo04cjr5osq2qw1ubtw00k, 2015-10-15T08:13:47.894Z, I'm a man and I stand for women's rights and women's right to choose their  decision for their health and Hillary is the best for the job in supporting  women so #Hillary2016﻿
z12vhfrhjunudboot04ccbc5rvr5zbnq0vg0k, 2015-10-14T08:09:42.013Z, Also anyone else like how bernie smiles when he shakes killary's hand and  then once he lets go he turns serious.﻿
z12bzdpivkz5j13va23uwrkyzyzuebesy, 2015-10-14T04:08:10.751Z, Unlike Republicans, Bernie can attack Hillary based on her policies, not  her emails or BENGHAZI.﻿
z13gtx0xpoughllox04cifuy5xbvhnggacw, 2015-10-13T21:40:20.898Z, Wow, Rubio has a point..﻿
z12dg5caoxundzhrf04cgxspimqwivgq114, 2015-10-13T17:54:38.042Z, does Rubio ever have any evidence to support his points other than a  personal anecdote?﻿
z13szj4b1sr1xlfgt04cjp3hdrecdhkq5pk0k, 2015-10-13T09:01:47.275Z, Concerning his missed votes, Rubio he say's the votes will not make a  difference unless we have a new president and that is why hes running?,,,  eea gad. And Christie will not only continue our police state surveillance  programs but make them bigger. The worst thing is both of these yo yos will  have us back at war in the Middle east within 1 yr.﻿
z13kcfsozyexibbfn22zfflryo2gzz3qe04, 2015-10-12T21:00:44.953Z, Rubio would surely beat Hillary in a general election. But he wouldn't beat Bernie Sanders. The democrats can't afford to nominate Hillary. She would hand over the  election to the republicans.﻿
z13ivl1bzmqgw5gyy04cen4ylmijzjw5rys0k, 2015-10-12T16:54:15.456Z, To me..personally...the perfect candidate is one with Obamas views, but  Marco Rubio's military mentality. ..John Kasich is surprisingly close to  fitting that bill﻿
z12hgxjwfxuuy14ut22vyfkxtoyuczyoj04, 2015-10-11T14:37:37.436Z, McCain, Hillary and Rubio are insane.﻿
z13tjtzxtkygvtt2d23fetxozpyie121n, 2015-10-10T15:09:38.954Z, Smack down of epic proportions. I like Carson, and will vote for him if  he's the Republican nominee. And while I am more of a Rubio guy, it's good  to see Carson push back like that.﻿
z12iyxtreveyvpzzu04cfjf4sli2uroyylk0k, 2015-10-09T22:13:35.485Z, Doctor Carson is an amazing, intelligent, honest and fearless individual. I  think he's a fantastik person in every sense of the word but in all  honesty, I'd rather see him as VP for a president Rubio or Jeb Bush. I may  seem blunt...but after almost 8 years of this Obamanation <Abomination> in  the White House, I would not like to see another A.A. prez right now.  Nobama has spoilt it for me. I know I may get backlash for this comment but  I that's how I feel right now.﻿
z13cz54yvmqccbfqe04cipg4mljowlnxwoc0k, 2015-10-08T21:26:28.007Z, If President Obama were white, these same people would be his biggest  supporters.﻿
z13uujr5iy24ir1ed23fupkqkkr3ihs15, 2015-10-08T20:27:45.154Z, I get it. Obama is black, yet ignores race relations.   Wolf is trying to box Ben in and I'm impressed in how he won't take the  bait.﻿
z12zd1ua1xusezvzq04cdtvbimivz5kiafc, 2015-10-07T22:16:25.913Z, Rubio sweats too much and Jeb is a wimp.....Go Trump 2016﻿
z12fihpajsnjc504204ch5tytsaiwzzakp00k, 2015-10-07T19:48:34.286Z, Don't like Trump, but I certainly don't like Sanders...   Rubio fp!﻿

z12mwjwqotayxvk4i04cejlb0mrfghggsmg0k, 2015-10-07T08:12:12.709Z, Someone in the United States wants to make the no-fly zone over Russia?  Marco Rubio for example! Come on!  American nation is ready to total destruction of American cities with use  nuclear weapons? ON Washington as ON Berlin !!!?  And this is not Putin! This is the great the will the Russian nation.The  will destroy the German Fascism.  Anti-Hitler coalition against the United States and USAISIS?﻿
z13ytd0ohmbdwd5dx22tubpabyziub2lx, 2015-10-07T01:36:27.647Z, Rubio is a true idiot. If his wife and daughter fall victim to any type of  sexual crime I want him to stand behind his comments. Rubio is a clueless  patsy supported by his corrupt constituents.﻿
z12utpii0wbpixbmk23zvj2hhq2fz10zv04, 2015-10-07T01:22:35.706Z, Rubio is a fucking con who want our borders wide open so his cousin  Consuela and Miguel can come here and mooch the system.﻿
z12zxhgbywuvcfb3u22ngvqrsna4f3eci, 2015-10-07T00:37:48.887Z, Rubio NOT eligible to be president....read your constitution!!!!!! you guys  are wearing me out...﻿
z12njdwx0rvqjjsml23usn2gqmj3ud0b404, 2015-10-07T00:35:26.747Z, JEB Bush said it best. Rubio is the rights barrack obama.﻿
z13mw1zhhxq2z1bcm22jtdfxcxnqjjeyl04, 2015-10-07T00:32:49.816Z, Marco Rubio is a lightweight and Jeb Bushes Mini-Me ! Anyone voting for this chimp should have their spleen removed and their  brain washed with bleach.﻿
z13tg5eaxsu1yjy2123iflbxryy3z1gl2, 2015-10-06T22:54:14.189Z, everyone is jumping on trumps tax plans rubio. trump killing these clowns.﻿
z134dhxiayfhx3xv222gxdsjjt21ilzws04, 2015-10-06T15:18:01.769Z, republican lack of good candidate to offer to the voters.﻿
z13yy55z2xe0hfub304cflrpttmjf3uawrs0k, 2015-10-06T13:22:40.005Z, Rubio needs water.﻿
z13gzh5xjm2keherz04cgrxybsftsdjhgjo, 2015-10-06T12:49:30.142Z, Yeah there is some contraction... Don't forget that Bush and Walker were  once the top 3 by big numbers, and Trump was near these numbers. Wait until  Rubio and Fiorina start to plummet and until some of these idiots drop  out... Donald Trump will stay in the lead by a big margin, because he has a  lot of voters its as simple as that﻿
z13rih0gfmm5dnuil04chbizptabgtrjfeg, 2015-10-06T12:36:59.812Z, SO is Donald trump making fun of Rubio for being poor and humble? Not  everyone had a rich daddy.﻿
z12yzdgoquf2fzdtx22utzhprlbqwdty304, 2015-10-06T03:21:08.294Z, *Still voting Trump - 2016 !!!* Women have done nothing to change Selective Service and until they change  that they should not acquire Presidency. Rubio is just weak.﻿
z12ziv4byynvttlmi22perbrbxy5hjgzu04, 2015-10-06T02:55:01.708Z, Bush is just the most hilarious person ever. He's bound to loose the  primaries so his goal now is to take Rubio down with him﻿
z13ivzm5bsuwexoch23cdbvilqydyj33p, 2015-10-06T00:43:12.211Z, I must admit that Rubio always kind of struck me as a cross between Bat-Boy  from The Weekly World News and The Beaver from Leave it to Beaver.﻿
z12zubk4tzvecd0f2224jxawxqefy53h404, 2015-10-05T23:49:33.046Z, i cant wait to see that clown give up and leave with his tail between his  legs.﻿
z12xvzzp3omagf2yk04cdtvbimivz5kiafc, 2015-10-05T01:43:04.069Z, Keep Rubio out of California he might drink all the water and sweat it out.﻿
z12ohl2bgvfnidj0p22nhzihlyfodfzkn, 2015-10-03T03:53:11.789Z, Marco Rubio has my vote.﻿
z13nyn5zdrr4vtj4504cdlgipsy0dzejql00k, 2015-10-02T21:41:20.850Z, Rubio is the Republican Obama. Articulate, intelligent, excellent in  debates and from the stump, even a tad charismatic. Very talented. But also  very young without any notable executive experience, oversimplifying the  world to fit his rhetoric, with a tendency to get aroused by his own  words.He should run something first, prove himself as a leader, and come  back in 10 years.﻿
z124zpc5uszzxnmtv235zjly2yi2fvf3x, 2015-10-02T08:18:23.333Z, what indicates that he can't take criticism? he's criticising bush and  rubio. jeb! is clearly having issues with it﻿
z12bhnxjnwbwfbfal04cilxz0nbadfg4q5o, 2015-10-01T19:22:58.888Z, GO TRUMP! What a rational calm cool approach. So much better than the traditional neo cons like Rubio and Fiorina. I like him.﻿
z12nx3dppmz1xte4v04cc5d4cwinexroeag, 2015-10-01T14:25:41.048Z, I'm really not seeing a reasonable, down to EARTH candidate in DONALD  TRUMP. Rand Paul, Rubio, even JEB would be better, sorry DONALD, you're a  great businessman and entertainer, but we can't use you right now.﻿
z12pgjk4xovxefuzo04cinzwlpu3ypgb1sc0k, 2015-09-30T15:27:30.581Z, screw rubio, he loves to give our money to foreign aid, hes a dam war  monger and punk bitch, he acts like a cop, an assholle, he supports the  most evil greedy and violent hated country ISRAEL, I am a high information  person but this is the first election I will participate in, Im 48 years  old, GO TRUMP. if anyone other then trump gets nomination, I will vote  democrat just because its rigged by special interest donors,﻿

z125yf0jhsehsvlp504cjhfodv24jluh5qw0k, 2015-09-29T13:03:51.497Z, Oh god, he's starting to take himself seriously! He's going to be in for a  rude awakening... He's already got crowds booing him and his polling  numbers are falling. I don't think he'll take it well.﻿
z12qyzfoykj3gzyn223tuhz5evytf5emy, 2015-09-29T11:50:12.149Z, It's either Trump, Bush or Rubio. I don't see anyone else getting the  support they need to win the nomination. I don't think anyone is interested  in another Bush presidency. Rubio is a smart guy, but he's really hyper and  young and it shows. I think, unless some craziness happens at the upcoming  debates, Trump will win the nomination.﻿
z13tcbtjsyefxjicd22iitvonqztg3lmu, 2015-09-29T02:03:15.205Z, Rubio sweats a lot for a young man......Trump 2016﻿
z12vy3dgwo3gcvv4o04cfjmgjmaxdvjguac, 2015-09-28T15:35:26.936Z, most people who don't like Obama are predjudice and have a mental and  emotional complex about difference of race. They may as well have a complex  about a box of crayon. They attack the messenger because this message is  quite humane.﻿
z13hjfehdqr0vdzqf04ccvrrcoeygbchrz40k, 2015-09-28T00:55:08.517Z, Ben fell apart at the first sign of someone pressing him on his views and  not letting him get away with the usual bullshit answers so his staffer  angrily ended it. How dare you ask my client real questions?!﻿

Sry you will be part of history in the same  catagori like the dark age or the nazis.

Wars,deficits, dream act,executive order for amnesty, world-wide recession,  ISIS, China and Russia taking over ect! And you want to vote for  establishment Rubio and establishment-backed Carly who abandoned the  tea-party in 2010 because she did not believe in them and and attacked  Boxer on her looks! And don't let me get started on Clinton or Sanders!﻿

z12swvjrilrvsngam04cgv4r4yyiwjsbnkw0k, 2015-09-25T03:03:17.880Z, The ESTABLISHMENT is doing everything possible to knock Trump out of the  race. They know he can't be bought.

z130e1i4yzq1fnasp224x5y5poeus1yxs04, 2015-09-21T10:21:39.207Z, Rubio comes across as just wanting to win for the sake of winning but I can  tell if in office he would be totally different﻿
z13wfx14gtqdcn4na224x5y5poeus1yxs04, 2015-09-21T10:20:19.278Z, Something is just very dishonest and sleezy about Rubio﻿
z12hypphxueuhfnev223thdpipfqzntnd, 2015-09-21T04:46:24.239Z, Rubio should off himself and his stories of plight.﻿
z13khfchtmigihxcb23rutf5sqfvibnws04, 2015-09-21T02:36:30.701Z, Rubio and theory no this is who the Democrats want to run against so this  is the reason why these people are the people in the lead in their poles  they would also enjoy other week rhinos like Donald Trump or Jeb Bush  easily beaten by literally any Democrat that ran against them﻿
z13vinkydxapgvp3323rutf5sqfvibnws04, 2015-09-21T02:35:03.923Z, once again CNN trying to create the narrative with their push polls the  suggestion that walkers bad and Rubio Bush's conservative blocker is good  what experience does Marco Rubio even have and if the one of the real  conservative Latino they would obviously pick Ted Cruz but the Liberals  fear Ted Cruz too much so create the moderate we need never going to win  Rubio. Rubio just like Jeff is a rhino﻿
z13jvrvz2sazxta0g23wt30j0nunihkm3, 2015-09-20T17:08:20.376Z, Rubio is dangerous? People who use language like that are dangerous. Uber  leftist.﻿

z132ydggbkfjzd5wt04celthgziyipfjfaw, 2015-09-17T18:11:29.110Z, Meanwhile he couldn't speak a lick of policy or how to do the job he's  running for. Maybe he can run for our country's mascot and put everyone  down, but the big guy making the decisions? I'm a liberal but I'd say  Rubio.﻿
z13aeflxhwe4vdkh304cibdhxmnxvp5rm14, 2015-09-17T18:04:31.259Z, Rubio you are eloquent, a great speaker, intelligent among other things  maybe but a jokester you ain't.﻿

z12mf3qodyu4z1myv04cilaztnyks3pwygg, 2015-09-17T17:45:38.737Z, CNN moderated the debate exactly like you would expect.  Ignorant  questions, and trying to pit one contender against the other so that no  real policy discussions could be had.  Trump and Bush were dumb enough to  fall into their trap; but the real winners, Rubio, Cruz, and Fiorina  weren't.  Good for them.﻿
z131cvdzynnrsp1wo04cd35a0rjptbc4rzw0k, 2015-09-17T16:59:02.630Z, Marco Rubio AIPAC puppet ﻿

z13scf3qhwb5fpnlw22kxfkwtzrcivd3q, 2015-09-17T14:52:08.591Z, why the fuck do all the repubs need to be barbaric pious morons? I'm a  libertarian, but Bernie seems to be the only reasonable choice this term.  goddamn I hate this country.  also why the hell isn't discussion of the national debt more prominent?﻿
z12mzx5zsoqpyhgjq04chnmzmuy1gz2jllg0k, 2015-09-17T13:56:24.131Z, Last night was a show of a bunch of monkeys trying to BS us. You could tell  by their expressions they didn't mean a word of what they were saying. You  know these guys hang out with each other when we are not looking. Like  Christie and Rubio hang out at Romney's home in Martha's Vineyard. It's all  one big club, and you aren't in it. Youtube "george carlin best 3 minutes"  then watch the video to see what I'm talking about. Thank God for Bernie  Sanders.﻿
z13sw3vw4qelitwqg04cjp2xey3lcpj5qr00k, 2015-09-17T12:43:02.505Z, I love how the media is playing up Fiorina and Rubio like crazy. Trump  killed this debate. He was under fire the entire night from every candidate  on stage, yet held his own very well without losing his cool or committing  any major gaffes. Trump won the Drudge poll by 60%. The media hates Trump  and will do anything to see him lose, but the people know who really won  the debate. TRUMP IN 2016!!!!﻿
z12gzdibwujjfhb5j04cjhugmoaqtxnp3i0, 2015-09-17T12:17:16.478Z, so who do you think was the winner?﻿
z13kutt5rzr1hbc5i04cihchupyxw3kwiis, 2015-09-17T09:21:11.848Z, Im not a fan of any them, but Cruz, Walker and Rubio make me cringe.  They're so phony. Everything they say sounds rehearsed. No one even bothers  to mock them by imitating them like they do Trump because they do a good  enough job of that themselves.﻿
z12wf52qxxz1iftwt04cengjeke2xvy4ojk, 2015-09-17T08:49:11.466Z, Stupid shit ever. What the fuck happened to the stun gun ?﻿

z132yrxxnn3texy3m22hexn4smmetphz504, 2015-09-17T04:14:16.237Z, The people who stood out in this debate are Carly, Rubio & Paul. When  debate started to be about health care, foreign policy, and economic policy  Trump was no where to be found. When CNN wanted a good joke they went to  the girl fight between Trup & Bush.﻿

z12lupjgdkbfujw0o221dttjqvjidntna, 2015-09-17T02:28:45.633Z, I believe Mr. Rubio was the one that spoke better than anyone , including  Trump. Atacking Bush 's wife was uncalled for becuase she was born in  Mexico. Trump's wife and ex wife came from another country and no one said  anything about. Trump is a man that knows how and when to say things to  benefit him. But he has a very good chance of winning the nomination ,  becuase He has money and power.﻿

Go to berniesanders.com/issues Ben Carson, Marco Rubio,  Hillary, etc. also have web pages that describe what they feel the  important issues are. So far I'm with Bernie. He wants to end NAFTA, stop  the TPP, stop big banks from gambling with our money, stop trading in  derivatives, increase social security, bring that 2.5 trillion dollars home  from large corporations who are hiding the money to avoid taxes. Geeze  there is so much common sense stuff coming from Bernie.﻿
z13aefehcxa5erugf04cg35oyzbjyh3zpz00k, 2015-09-05T21:17:04.521Z, As a Trump supporter, I have to say I'm very disappointed in Trump on this  issue. Trump dropped the ball here. Watch Huckabee's numbers jump.﻿

z12zwlnzesbazb3yp04cjnmobweogpphink0k, 2015-08-08T10:19:34.686Z, Republicans know that without Trump there is no party. The others do not  know what to say without copying what he says. Rubio even used his slogan.  I was worried that the people would be swayed, but now I have faith after  seeing post debate polls where he annihilated the others. We can't wait for  Trump to go to Washington to say, "OBAMA.....YOU"RE FIRED!".﻿

z12werqwjzy4jb25404cd52ztzujcb35mvw0k, 2015-08-07T16:41:51.489Z, Deny it all you want you murderous feminist SJW women and your white  knights, but Rubio does have a valid point. If it's not a human life at  conception, then what it is? It took me a while to figure it out too, but  all I could come up with was a BABY in nine months time!﻿
z123sx3hlzvet1nxt04cdxigpwinvbyrvuk0k, 2015-08-07T16:41:35.240Z, If he sees life as sacred then why does he support the Death Penalty and  why does he support going to War?﻿
z121vlxyxqmvsx4cp233ttcrxluhf1kgz04, 2015-08-07T15:59:04.435Z, Rubio arguing to give 2nd Amendment rights to unborn fetuses. Rubio is an idiot.﻿
z13xxzxpsnv0ill4b04cipmbjlb5yf0o0hc, 2015-08-07T15:29:37.672Z, Faith is inferior to facts, Rubio, and the fact is that a single celled  zygote should not be afforded the same rights as the woman who just got  raped. It would be akin to believing that sperm should be protected under  the law. Sperm are living one celled organisms too with human DNA. So are  Ovums.﻿
z13fxxjolrmpgnocq23qy54rcravgvyfw, 2015-08-07T15:27:46.509Z, Rubio can feel as strongly as he likes about when life begins. Given how  passionately he opposes abortion, I hope he never has one. But he will NOT  shove his crucifix up a woman's uterus!﻿
z13sczcaszbrc3n2v23aevsafzavwjtcr, 2015-08-07T15:09:45.449Z, Wtf who would vote for this garbage mother fucker , he doesn't give a fuck  about the people who are alive , let a lone a sperm cell !! He is a murder  when he jacks off or when he get his dick sucked!﻿
z13htrk4sonmu1ten221zjuayqbjspqv5, 2015-08-07T14:53:34.018Z, I wonder why Rubio and his republicans, don't mind sending living people,  to other countries to kill or be killed. Or when they give an actual living  person, a death sentence. If life is life, then black life matters. Unborn  baby life matters. That crazy white boy, who killed all those people in  that theatre, his life matters too. This is the 21st century. We better  start acting like it.﻿
z12cxhuxpy3hgx1ew23eizpyltu3vlcey, 2015-08-07T14:47:02.870Z, Mr Rubio please respect 'seperation of church and state'.﻿
z13addpxonmpgjcap04cgnoj2ketclnr1zs0k, 2015-08-07T14:32:25.397Z, Should have asked Rubio to site his "scientific sources" that confirm his  idea based on faith that life begins at conception.  Missed your chance  there Chris.﻿

z12mjlvbozykzdhrk04cel5b3vqyztdjh4k, 2015-08-07T13:31:23.877Z, Marcos Rubio lost that argument ... big time. The president of the United  States should embrace any kind of faith ... including the lack of it ...﻿

z12jfns4yvu1zvnyf04cjv35vv2ufb5p1xw0k, 2015-08-03T13:25:06.538Z, Rand Paul is the best LEADER running, and an impartial study will show he  really does have the best, most well thought out plan for the USA - he  might not have Trumps money or TV connections, but he can win with  grassroots support - the primaries and primary debates will be critical,  based on his record and his platform, Senator Paul has got my vote in the  primaries.﻿

He couldn't congratulate Islamist thugs like Mursi,  Rohani and Erdogan fast enough but he had to literally be forced to get on  the phone with Netanyahu, the only democratic leader in the Middle East. -  Marco Rubio was dead on with his speech!﻿
z13mxf1ywwqqc5nbk04cdvfqbvifxzsrwq00k, 2015-03-21T19:50:19.776Z, I understand we shouldn't always vote Dem but to say to vote Rep? He has to  be a fuckin idiot. Dems are just the lesser of the two evils. Don't say  vote Rep, say we need more options dickhead. Obviously the GOP paid you off  to become one of their House Negros aka bottom bitch. Any Black person that  follows your ignorant rhetoric deserves exactly what the outcome will be.  How about we look at more independent Candidates instead?﻿
z13bcdthavr4gd32022osl0xlwqjfzlsl, 2015-03-21T13:10:01.328Z, Rubio's military service zilch, but he is willing to defend Israel at all  costs, provided he doesn't have to foot the bill.﻿

z12hunbggribihxzv04cgn5r1uuhh3ba2jo, 2015-03-17T18:17:35.015Z, CNN is for clowns. 89% of Democrats still support her not to mention  minorities where she has a strong hold. I'm voting for her because I am  angry that women are treated in such way in America. Bush, Walker also did  it but no reprisal for them. Why? They're men.﻿

z12fuhbw0ovrz5ofe22qszx4infkfh5xc04, 2015-01-14T03:30:46.354Z, Notice he's quick to describe the problem.....low wages and a large  underemployed populace.  The last race promises were made that they were  first priority.  That was a flat lie.....the pipeline was first priority.   So Rubio did not mention a solution.  Mark my word.....he will eventually  say cut corporate income taxes to zero so business can create jobs.  Sound  familiar?  Just remember....there are two kinds of conservatives...the 1%  and the suckers.  Check your pockets!!﻿

z13acffrgtiki1dti22ifbzh2qidjnc4504, 2014-12-28T02:39:42.695Z, Notticed most Cubans are the same traitors... most get here illegally, get  a free pass to Citizenship and then turn their back on their own people.  Most Cubans in power like Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio give two shits about the  nation that seen their parents born. They Have No honor, Zero respect for  dignity and become Republicans. If I was in power and had the authority to,  I would deport every single Cuban that crosses that damn waterline, lets  not forget the cold war. ﻿
z13odzkwbubkvhmdz22ndzuizsamtf3gn04, 2014-12-24T03:29:55.290Z, I'll believe that Right-Wing "race baiting" conspiracy when the Republican  party includes a significant amount of different races in their ranks.  Until then, they have no argument, no evidence, no valid nor sound  rationale whatsoever that would indicate it's the Left that's perpetuating  this false concept. On the Left white, black, brown we all get along JUST  FINE. It's them who are projecting their own insecurities and mistrust onto  us. ﻿
z13udbt5cxfpfdumi23fszdrzsnwi5cba04, 2014-12-19T07:43:09.777Z, Rubio shows he doesn't have an idea that wasn't half-baked from some cold  war era nitwit. Go back to Little Havana and stay in your little isolated  area with the rest of the dinosaurs. Y Comemierda!﻿
z13nv1naxufpyxgcv23zxtoo3zywg3urc04, 2014-12-18T20:07:13.620Z, Hypocritical views of Republican leaders. We don't see any Republicans  pushing for democracy in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE,US partners/allies.   Sen Rubio pre-campaign also assumes Hispaniscs other than Cuban-Americans  favor keeping the useless 50 year embargo.  Cubans born and living in Cuba  have been the only victims of this embargo... not the Castros regime...   PD Most Hispanics are not voting for this guy.......﻿
z13udhkxlp3oubx2d22bgtuj1nqohz2d1, 2014-12-18T18:51:21.728Z, So according to Rubio China gets a pass because they are an economic giant.  Reporter doesn't check him on that.﻿

It's standard procedure and if you were  fighting someone for a gun you bet you would shoot someone 6 times over to  make sure they were dead I would have done the same.

He's  basically telling me "i'm not going to stop doing what's killing you, your  sisters, your daughters, your friends and every woman you'll ever meet. I'm  not.

Mitch McConnel said when Obama was being president that he would would  never work with him, this is fact. HOW WAS THIS MAN REELECTED?

z13bvvyz3wfnhh1cf22szhlppzqrhzzfi, 2014-05-12T21:04:38.134Z, Is Rubio a US Senator or Venezuela?  Learn to govern your own damn state,  because your foreign policy strategy is nil.﻿
z12dunrqdvytg3bzb04cfvuacnvmxtkprh4, 2014-05-12T18:50:21.327Z, Rubio probably orders from Bijou World, But bad mouths it in public most  likely......﻿
z12rz54acsesf5hxr04cf3xqaqryuxrzxhs, 2014-05-12T15:47:19.367Z, Marco Rubio...another idiot perfect for White House.﻿
z13dfhhrjvjxzheju04cebqpsozjuhzjlvs0k, 2014-05-12T15:02:45.605Z, Rubio wants to rule the world!﻿
z122ubu5pwjls5akk22lxpi5bvynjvwiy04, 2014-05-12T15:00:20.681Z, Who knew Rubio was a politician and a scientist also. This guy is just  amazing and THE REPUBLICAN PARTY is lucky to have him.﻿
z13kezggex3wv53kc23mw1hblujxvrxxs04, 2014-05-12T14:16:47.932Z, He related to Paulina Rubio?﻿
z13vsh4apkbfudvxk04cflhrzyihzbsidks0k, 2014-05-12T13:49:53.602Z, Marco Rubio will next defy the rules of ARITHMETIC!﻿
z13ythfjnu2bixmqr04cchbpckaqvpza3ak, 2014-05-12T13:09:11.122Z, Whatever you do, don't actually address what Rubio said. Just make fun of  him for some made up reasons. Because Hillary was a massive failure. Then  she quit, like she always does.﻿
z125fpy4bmm0fzrro04cf3ch5srccztgxfs, 2014-05-04T02:42:35.206Z, MARCO RUBIO you take yourself too seriously.  YouR rhetoric is that of a  child trying to impress his parents with high minded principles and  disingenuous references to God and country.  You are fool to think that you  are the multicultural answer to White America. Cubans, U.S. citizens and  residents of Mexican decent despise you and your fluffy frothy patriotism.   You are lock stepping with the most extreme Republican talking points.  You  don't impress anyone MARCITO.﻿
z12fwfqwuou0dhg1d221g5ihtrvazfvbq04, 2014-04-17T01:53:44.738Z, Jeanne Moos, how the f**k do you keep a job?! You've taken a traditional  native ceremony and slapped your/our American racist bias on it, and turned  it into something tawdry. Nice going! 'Meruka! Man... F**k CNN "The leader  in world news"﻿
z13zvzq5qtnmcp4r304cjl2zkpi4jpxbgms0k, 2014-04-11T04:44:16.792Z, Well for once I agree with Rubio. I think the US should stop showing so  much hostility towards Cuba. I'm not saying to pressure the Cuban  government to shift to the right, but an attempt to diplomatic relations  never hurt anyone. ﻿
z13dv5jiio2ffb3i004ccdu53x3kcppocx40k, 2014-04-08T23:42:36.543Z, Marco Rubio has a good head on his shoulders. He has a good grasp on  foreign policy. I agree 100%. Marco will make a good vice president for Dr.  Rand Paul in 2016. Rand will pick up the slack on immigration and Rubio has  foreign affairs covered.﻿
z13efloiolmidda3422dcz0ponurid35s04, 2014-04-08T21:57:22.224Z, For some reason, Micahel Rubio reminds me of Samuel L. Jackson, and a  traitor.﻿

z13yc1igwmqhupujm04cebqpsozjuhzjlvs0k, 2014-03-09T05:07:11.616Z, Rand Paul is such a JOKE! Marco Rubio's me the wrong way every time he  opens his mouth! Sarah Palin rounds off this collection of not-so-merry  prankster's. Do people have to pay some sort of admission to hear this? ﻿
z13ucpiyow2itjkx504cdjaaqkafdrlg1xk0k, 2014-03-08T01:15:48.113Z, so, the debates are gonna be interesting...﻿
z125sd1jozmqsxy1z22wvlpa1wnxd3z3m, 2014-03-07T00:00:41.861Z, Damnit Rubio is correct that's why they just passed a Ukraine relief  package The President asked for and he is condemning Russia and he is  imposing sanctions.  ﻿
z120hp0rfrbyyn3xm04cg1jpvsfkgvybl5w, 2014-03-06T21:36:47.358Z, so what rubio is saying, he doesn't support obama's policy of standing by  Ukraine and condemning russian action﻿
z13nshchprq1zdyid04ch12i3q3jw3ziu3w, 2014-03-06T21:33:04.470Z, Marco Rubio looks like a child with wounded feelings :-)﻿

z13cz5qrmkfcybcun22jdp244qi2uht22, 2014-03-05T06:58:36.645Z, Rubio would have credibility if he actually understood the issue and hadn't  sold out his supporters last year.﻿
z12hgtwo3ozfc3wsg230h1jzcwr5xvn3e, 2014-03-05T05:58:44.875Z, Rubio is wrong. Putin didn't move troops in because he didn't like how it  turned out. He moved them in because he is exploiting an opportunity.﻿

z12yvtlibketxr2sh23uxvxqcpatvf43e, 2014-02-18T12:06:04.931Z, S.E you talk tough, but you'll never make any personal sacrifice for this  cause. If you're brave enough go inside Syria and join fight. Typical  politicians, are always willing to send of others to fight their wars. S.E  interest in Syria is political and has very little to do with the actual  people in Syria. ﻿

z13yzzzw3qiovvx3a22sgrxysnmicn13y, 2015-11-04T15:37:03.494Z, Rubio is the only one that can go against Hillary. Who else? Trump? Sleepy  Carson? Ted Cruz was a master debater back in his college days so maybe he  can do something. C'mon splash your face with some cold water and look at  reality. Don't hand over the Presidency to Hillary in a silver platter with  Trump and Zzz Carson.﻿

z131xruzkxzhutgz204cg3tqfxj4tz543eo, 2015-09-30T13:05:44.813Z, your "experts" better start doing their homework, USA Today because Donald  Trump is still LEADING the pack by substantial margins. No one is going to vote for Amnesty Rubio or that train wreck Fiorina. We, the people, want Donald J. Trump as our next President. Just because you don't like him doesn't give you the right to LIE about his  standing in the race. SMH #TRUMP2016﻿
z13dirnrspzwt1dso22dy14oynvsctgds, 2015-09-28T19:19:41.696Z, Vote for Trump guys. What can Marco Rubio do? Bring in more immigrants to  make America poorer? huh?﻿
z12whpzrnketeblnx233txmg2smhxtypi04, 2015-09-27T01:36:05.219Z, Clearly, the target of the booing is Rubio. While the title of the video is  technically correct, the strong implication is that the crowd booed Trump.  The people at USA Today use words for a living; they know what they're  doing when they use words. This is lying by false implication. Shame on USA  Today.﻿
z13ntt5x1kimjty3523csj3zzzjlcpf4s04, 2015-09-26T07:46:15.365Z, they booed Rubio! They did the same thing with Bush at his rallies.﻿
z121fd2h3ru2ctelf23qfh5aprqittvja04, 2015-09-26T06:49:34.668Z, They were booing Rubio. Incredibly obvious﻿
z12azvcolqu5d1luw220ivbhmmzwjjrix04, 2015-09-26T06:41:16.959Z, I like how trump supporters were saying they were booing Rubio, but either  before then or after because I'm not sure since i didn't watch it, they are  cheering Rubio the whole way, if the people were really booing Rubio than  they still would have been booing at him when he walked out, This is why I  don't believe they were booing at Rubio but rather trump because they  probably tired of him being the pissy fit man he really is﻿
z125ztzjxojdt1ct323uwph51sz0wryjq04, 2015-09-26T05:54:51.906Z, Youtube search right side radio for the full version. They booed Rubio! The  media is so dishonest!﻿
z12qyhkafobmu5m3f22xhjljfymtg3eq304, 2015-09-26T02:32:50.310Z, The title is so misleading. They were booing Rubio! The crowd was obviously  on Trump's side. This just shady journalism.﻿

z13agr2pouafjztt3220gb1byz2afnxkk, 2015-08-18T19:42:17.362Z, There is a reason the boy rubio is losing every where he goes...rubio's  stance on abortion is insane...rubio would have you believe that if someone  raped his wife, and she got pregnant, and that he had to chose between  saving his wife's life or that fetus from another man, he would let his  wife die, now that is truly fuked up.....﻿
z13qedlxyufohna2c23otnxjtzjbermgi04, 2015-07-19T02:38:02.741Z, I'll tell you what, I would vote for Trump before I would vote for most of  the republican candidates. The only other guys that I kinda like are Rand  Paul and Marco Rubio.﻿

z12tzpfazkjnfdabb04cirwh1pesuhyiwiw, 2015-04-13T22:11:02.871Z,  Marco Rubio is racist towards black people and 95% of the Cubans that live  in Miami. Even the Rock Dwayne Johnson ex wife parents didn't like him  because his father was black. You can even ask white people in Miami and  they will tell you they don't like black people. ﻿

z12ff1jwhvmgx3tso22ndd4izvv5inpgw04, 2015-11-12T04:11:39.916Z, I'm sorry, but with all due respect, how can Rubio say he's pro- new  American century when his POLICIES are the same old policies guaranteed to  return us to the status-quo. There's absolutely nothing different or new he  would put forward in policy that hasn't been done before. It's deceitful to  say "new American century" when peddling archaic policies.﻿
z12adfew4pjthveec235dbfixtekehkpi04, 2015-11-12T03:09:30.324Z, None of these disgusting freaks intend to run for President. All the want  is to keep the money donated to their super-Pacs.

z12kit1qjxutuhsm223vdvegov3hzzxpd04, 2015-11-10T06:45:37.415Z, Rubio said "It wasn't a credit card, it was an American Express charge  card".﻿

z13fyn5y1ruafhnbe04cj5s4hzehwjogymg0k, 2015-10-30T00:17:05.064Z, Rubio is too young and it shows. Carson is a moron, and he lied on the  Mannatech question. Trump is too immature, and he lied on the Zuckerberg  quote... Hillary, even worse, responsible for the death of an American  ambassador. Jim Webb was a better candidate, maybe he dropped out too soon.  Sanders will be unable to accomplish anything except gridlock.﻿

z12nhlv44yrqgn1ck23mfjnxvvvuenkvx, 2015-08-10T13:27:52.225Z, The Trump did crossed the line for being disrespectful and unapologetic  like a 5 year-old spoil brat. Donald Trump should never be trusted because  for the same reason that he killed the USFL, that semi-pro spring football  league in the 1980s because he want to move the USFL to the fall. But when  it comes to politics, he's lousy leader. And I don't believe Senator Marco  Rubio comments on the Democrats. The Democrats do have good candidates for  President and I'm voting for a Democrat.﻿

Yeah, it's a little bit of an  awkward reach but the man needed a drink of water. If you're thirsty,  you're thirsty. I'd much rather the man take a drink of water for a dry  throat than start having to clear his throat and cough. Republican,  Democrat, whatever, what's the big deal?﻿

z13hyfkhqqvfvpevn234thsiqnfcttknx, 2015-04-20T18:52:54.452Z, Hillary is not my first choice but after watching the alternatives (Ted  Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Rick Perry....) I decided to  vote for her.﻿
z13ncfig5u22ibnwv04cgn5r1uuhh3ba2jo, 2015-04-20T18:46:38.800Z, Hillary all the way..... Look at the alternatives (Ted Cruz, Scott Walker,  Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Rick Perry.....).﻿
z13zcdqqflrsvrkew230dpagukn1u3ofi, 2015-04-19T04:45:32.670Z, Rubio is a little bitch war hawk whose never severed in the armed forces. Rand is a fuckboy, Ted Cruz has no chance of winning. Mike Fu-abee, makes  old fat whites giddy. So, yeah, they have no winners. #hillaryclinton2016 !  #VoteBlue﻿
z12md1vjnviohj4cc231vvgrjqqjdrkwg04, 2015-04-18T14:57:43.920Z, Damnit, Rubio!! Drinking water like a fucking human! What's your problem? ﻿
z12pv35qnuqis342j22sixxbhonhhdv5n04, 2015-04-17T07:34:54.753Z, I know this man. I worked for him and his company for five years. he  started from nothing and built a large company from scratch.  but I do  agree. it's a bit excessive.﻿
z124txubet3axjtym04chxhhhxqpiz0h0uo0k, 2015-04-16T20:30:18.226Z, I'm really disappointed that HRC didn't explain the PRODUCTIVITY ("more  from less") of having two iPhones instead of one.  What a distraction  indeed!  Also, when the Republicans use "yesterday" as Rubio did, he CANNOT  deny Cuba further entrance into our long delayed union 90 miles away.﻿
z135ulni1znrwx3yf04cfpcr2o2osxjyge0, 2015-04-16T15:39:50.800Z, The GOP is pushing Mark Rubio because they realize one of their white old  republicans wont work against her.  To be honest i dont think Mark Rubio  will work either.﻿
z13ncn4rhzjyyf0oq04cfz1zokvavxtjhxo0k, 2015-04-16T06:56:09.586Z, It amazes me that it's 2015 and republicans are still anti-women,  anti-education, anti-science, anti-equality... They are living in the  freakin' dark ages. It's utterly disgusting that women are paid less for  same work than men and republicans want to keep it this way. I'm voting  Hillary all the way! I'm living in the 21st century -- NOT the 14th  century! republicans are utterly demented and sick and stupid.﻿
z12yv3jzwkamufo5c04chv3xzvbcuxnzc4o, 2015-04-16T01:34:37.317Z, Bush-Rubio 2016!﻿

z13gynn5rsbewbs3y22fj3mxtoi3s1uu4, 2015-04-14T21:12:22.583Z, If you are more worried about Marco Rubio's water drinking habits than his  policies then I don't know what to tell you.﻿
z12ph1maiyncwhtku23yvturhwawz3nam04, 2015-04-14T16:43:00.148Z, I'd rather Putin look over and see Hilary than Rubio. If Putin were to look  at Rubio...his stare would bring Rubio to his knees. Hilary has been  reading and deciphering powerful men for more than 40 years.﻿
z12rzbfbqnqlybg5v04cgftjllzksjoyhso0k, 2015-04-14T15:10:38.019Z, Rubio has spock's ear.  That is the good thing.   I am shaky about his  immigration policy though﻿
z12gir1jaleatta0r23wwlj5yt3adrka504, 2015-04-14T03:00:15.261Z, Obama has failed miserably economically. He has chosen not to lead in  foreign affairs and has allowed Islamic terrorism to grow with his  ineptness to make it a priority. We need a conservative back in office with  traditional values. God bless Mr.Rubio.﻿
z12se1zitq2qg33mg22zjp3bxzjlevua004, 2015-04-14T01:58:42.930Z, Hillary is fake, I would rather see liz she is the real deal. All the rep  are good Rubio wife is really hot if he wins she will be the hottest first  lady of all time. Now some may say that's not a reason to vote but I say I  am 60 and her good looks are real  and that is better than some false  promise﻿
z121ebbgyvaluxhqs04cgn5r1uuhh3ba2jo, 2015-04-14T01:04:51.821Z, Only old Cubans will vote for Rubio, the rest of the Latinos won't. Rubio  is a climate denier and a vote for Rubio is a vote for Netanyahu and more  wars.﻿

z13rzn5gmujcirbyb04cgfzp1w3oydfqr4g, 2015-04-13T21:29:28.043Z, Is Rubio the anti-Jeb who can win the nomination?﻿
z12rhfto4x2evdl2522wynuphtz1wfg2y, 2015-04-13T20:35:04.783Z, I searched 'rubio' for today's videos and filtered them by view count.   This video had the most views with 1,500 after 7 hours.  I think its safe  to say that America doesn't give a fuck about chickenhawk marco rubio.   Thank god.﻿
z12ocnybhpq5in4ut223hfabbsnsu1kjq04, 2015-04-13T19:57:00.248Z, This guy is genuine!  No fakes in the white House in 2016! Marco Rubio a leader who stands up for America and her people! You got us Marco!﻿
z120efvjcvrwd5sum225yzgwtq3gehx5n04, 2015-04-13T19:02:32.578Z, Marco Rubio LMAO this is going to be fun﻿
z13zxbm5guutibkar04ccpvorqnhtfwy1po0k, 2015-04-13T18:23:22.250Z, Also he was born in 1971, but his parents weren't citizens until 1975, so  although he was born here he is not a "natural born citizen" because he was  Cuban at birth and became naturalized along with his parents. If he was to  win the nomination the Leftist Media would suddenly learn about this and  pull the rug out from under him.﻿
z12uyhcqdzbud5hum22bulpogqu0ejtmj, 2015-04-13T17:36:06.313Z, Rand Paul, NO. Ted Cruz,  NO. Marco Rubio, NO. Anyone else the GOP is gonna  put up? So far, none of them stand a chance in 2016﻿
z130gdhyxzn3gtrv522ycdu4knv1zlpl3, 2015-04-13T16:28:24.932Z, Marco Rubio is a great man... for me to poop on.﻿
z130dnlhvou5dbxta23ktnghjq2dxzbx504, 2015-04-13T10:44:23.553Z, Its not that he took the drink...its the retarded way he did it!  Something's not quite right with him...elevator doesn't go all the way  up...not the sharpest tool in the shed...a few fries short of a happy meal.  Rubio- too thirsty to be President﻿
z13wc1cpnkeju5ct0231f5wgmr20tpeba04, 2015-04-13T10:22:12.022Z, Go for it!!!! Theres too many haters out there, but u can make it.

z12qxrc5zkbfixz0y22pe1rhalb5c3jak04, 2015-04-13T06:07:48.288Z, Cannot wait to see all of the "butthurts" WHEN she becomes our next  President. It is inevitable. It HAS been inevitable. Look at the trash she  is running against! Has and always will be. At times, eh, trash may not be  taken out, but when it is, this country runs half ass like it should  because of all the dooky that was left behind to clean up! haha P.S.

z13ad3340s3fhrxjn04cibvqnqr0f14xodc, 2015-04-12T22:01:13.168Z, I'm in Hillary, you got my vote [who's joining me?]. I wanted to vote for  her in 2008 but Barack usurped her momentum. Do we really want another  neocon/republican/libertarian looking out for #1 and not you? Do the right  thing people. Hillary Clinton 2016.﻿
z13uhj5haxmoi3edr232spiyuzyfspjau04, 2015-04-12T19:30:57.731Z, If anyone supports her, their voting because of her sex and not because  they've actually been paying attention to her "accomplishments. "﻿

z125it1p5mjzyxzk4231udqqwwzddh5l0, 2015-03-29T03:05:10.359Z, Fair or not, this was Rubio's "Howard Dean moment." His stock was rising  considerably until this fatal sip. It is amazing how we view politicians,  and penalize them, I grant you. But how could he not know this ahead of  time? LMAO this is as awkward as it gets.﻿

He is a GOP hispanic politician  puppet on a  string. The guy is a nervous wreck whenever he speaks. He is not a GOP  rising star, more like a falling star.

Rubio and other Republican representatives RELY  HEAVILY ON THE CUBAN EXILE VOTE. So much that they NEED to keep this  economic strangulation.

When he says,  "has brought us to this stage ", he tells us exactly what that means! This  isn't vauge, meaningless  politcal dribble at all! When Jingle says,"assult on religious liberties" thats code for "he's  lettiin the queers get married". ﻿
